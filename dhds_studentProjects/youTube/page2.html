      <li><span class="negative">This game looks nice.. but it's overhyped. In two years Destiny will be as popular
            as Time Splitters.</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">so sick of shooters.</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">Geez, Halo much?</span></li>
      <li><span class="positive">Destiny is currently installing. Almost time to find out if it's as good as people
            have said</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">They are spending way too much on advertising and hype, it's an ok game but at its
            core it's just a shiny borderlands clone.</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">so basically its halo....</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">I'm just not sold on this game it just looks like halo re skinned</span></li>
      <li><span class="positive">Looks awesome, now just release it for PC as-well &gt;.&lt;</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">I dont know, I have hard time getting excited about any MMO nowadays. The whole MMO thing just no longer has any appeal. You guys have fun without me! o/</span></li>

      <li><span class="positive">to all the console peasants THANK YOU FOR BETA TESTING DESTINY FOR THE PC MASTER RACE</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">Coming from the clowns who gave Halo 4 a fucking 9.8, it's hard for me to take this seriously.</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">#pcmasterrace  You silly console peasants...</span></li>
      <li><span class="positive">I actually think, this is the first time IGN Gave an honest score</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">I give this game a 5/10 because it's boring</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">i rather play warframe or mass effect then this shit</span></li>
      <li><span class="neutral">Why did IGN make this review so epic?</span></li>
      <li><span class="positive">This game is a lot higher than a 7.8...</span></li>
      <li><span class="positive">The best and one of the most honest reviews I've heard in a long time from IGN....</span></li>
      <li><span class="positive">I wasnt at all excited for destiny, but when I sat down and played it I was pleasantly
            surprised. The seamless multiplayer is great, it it is oh-so thrilling when a random
            public event happens and everyone gathers around ready for a fight.</span></li>

      <li><span class="negative">Wait, how the hell are they breathing on Mustafar without some sort of suit? If it's almost entirely
            volcanic, they'd be inhaling a lot of carbon dioxide and other gases.</span></li>
      <li><span class="positive">Episode III was definitely the best of the prequel movies.</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">Screw you, Vader destroying the medical room was one of the most intense scenes!</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">Can't get past the first twenty seconds. Change your damn voice and then we'll talk.</span></li>
      <li><span class="positive"> I watched all 3 reviews over the course of this weekend. That was fucking awesome. Thank you!</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">This movie sucks dick fucking elephant dick. Ya got that?</span></li>
      <li><span class="positive">I think it says a lot that this review is a more engaging film than the film it's
            a review of.</span></li>
      <li><span class="positive">lol Nadine is more compelling character than half the characters in the prequels.</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">so  far episode 7 looks better than all three prequels, it cant be worse than the

      <li><span class="negative">As 25-30% of this movie was shot with Paul most of these glamour shots are not him
            but his brothers with cgi rendering and digital voice dubbing similar to what was
            done in Tron Legacy. With that said a lot of Paul in this trailer isnt him at all.
            Get used to it fans. I think the only real shots of him were in the beginning, and
            that glamour shot with Vin. Everything else is body doubles. I think the shot at 2:13
            is most definitely a rendered double.</span></li>

      <li><span class="positive">Meanwhile at the Cat Institute, leading feline scientists have announced that Phase
            Three of world domination is proceeding as planned with Phase Four (elimination of
            all vacuum cleaners) running into early issues.</span></li>
      <li><span class="positive">I, for one, welcome our new cat overlords.</span></li>
      <li><span class="positive">Cats (and dogs) have always been our overlords.</span></li>
      <li><span class="neutral">"Tolerate". A very appropriate word. Cats still have some evolving left to do.</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">"Cats still have some evolving left to do." As do dogs, humans, monkeys, 'pet' birds,
            cattle, sheep, pigs, etc. I grew up on a farm - the farm was not complete UNLESS there were at least one dog and multiple cats - the dog to make sure the other (domesticated)
            animals 'behaved' themselves, the cats to hunt and kill rats and mice for supplemental
            food for themselves. And I'll not even comment on how humans need to evolve, especially
            CONservatives.</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">As if evolution is a deterministic process with goals. Evolution is something that
            will happen when pressure is applied to populations of a species otherwise that population
            will inevitably die off. Cats are less social toward their human hosts than dogs because
            dogs are simply more domesticated than cats. Which brings me to the point that the
            evolution of cats, and to a greater degree, dogs has been guided by humans through
            selective breeding rather than natural selection.</span></li>
      <li><span class="neutral">Why? They've evolved to the point where they can train their humans very well.</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">We're doing quite well Mike, beating the hell out of you DemocRATS last week. Or is that DemoCRAPS?</span></li>
      <li><span class="neutral">meow meow meow meow, meow you!</span></li>
      <li><span class="positive">The article made note of genes for fear. Never really perceived cats that way, even
            though when I grew up the phrase "scaredy cat" was frequently heard - sometimes as
            an epithet and sometimes as a dare.</span></li>

      <li><span class="positive">Damn,  i was hoping that they had at least gotten back some data concerning the boring
            installed by the drill.  I had a shred of hope that they would find some sort of primitive
            bacteria or exotic amino acid(s) within the ice sample. Looks like we'll have to wait
            4-6 months to even find out what was collected.</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">What do I think? I'm not sure, but I DON'T think it's "poignant" (NBC) or "sad" (Rosetta). It's a machine bouncing on a rock
            in the void of space.</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">Since we're being trivial here, a common definition of poignant is: causing a strong
            feeling of sadness.  As NBC used the term, "a poignant series of images", this is
            perfectly appropriate. It may not cause a feeling of sadness on your part, but for
            many people it does.Also, the probe is not "bouncing on a rock in the void of space".
            At least not any longer.  It seems to have settled onto the surface quite nicely,
            thank you.</span></li>

      <li><span class="negative">Wait, what? Gas is cheap? news to me.</span></li>
      <li><span class="neutral">I drive the same thing I did before the gas went to $4. Gets about 30 MPG in town.</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">Are people really so short sighted and stupid that they think gas prices are going
            to stay this low? Well, they just elected a bunch anti-working class Republitwits
            to congress, so I guess they are, but gas can jump to six dollars a gallons just as
            quickly as it dropped to three! Idiots...</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">Errr... yeah! Gas is so incredibly cheap right now that I am considering buying a
            more costly and less efficient car! Clearly a slow news day for NBC...</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">Americans have got to be the most monumentally stupid and self-centered people on
            the planet.</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">Pretty hard to tow a cattle trailer with a prius.</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">I come from the State that is economically 49th in this country. Most working people
            who earn less then the medium income as other states cannot afford hybrid cars, electric
            batter or otherwise that car manufacturers put a high price on. I am still driving
            my 1999 Chevy Tracker that manufacturers stopped building because people loved them
            so much, they hang onto them. General Motors should have continued to build and sell
            them to keep marketing Trackers to include economically pressed families who are able
            to afford them. Instead, the small SUVs today are not cheap and maintenance is also
            not cheap in today's world. I will drive my 99' till it drives no more. That vehicle
            is known to hold up to over 300k miles with little care. Mine still looks like up
            to date vehicles. Ha Ha!! With just 144k miles on it now with really good body integrity. I expect it to keep
            working like the pink bunny. If GM brought the Tracker back as it was manufactured
            back then, they would fly out the door really fast. Consumer Reports rated them really
            good.</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">Gas is Cheap? Only if your uncle lives in Saudi Arabia and owns an oil well! Theyre
            acting like gas prices have been falling for Decades. It has only been, what, 2 weeks
            since gas prices started to drop and that can go right the other direction in a heart
            beat like we have seen in the past! No thanks, been burned one too many times by erratic
            fuel prices and still trying to unload the gas guzzler I have now. Who ever wrote
            this article is living in a dream world or Daddy Exxon pays their bills</span></li>
      <li><span class="neutral">I never cared what the gas price is. I drive a 4x4 diesel 3/4 ton truck to just cruise
            around in. Have a couple 1&amp;1/2 ton trucks to do more serious work.</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">Yes, in the couple weeks that gas has dipped a measly .30-.40/gal SUV sales have just absolutely skyrocketed and fuel efficient cars are practically extinct.
            Get your head out of your ass.</span></li>

      <li><span class="negative">Confederate soldiers should have had a price on their heads.</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">Too bad they could not save him. RIP And now a few conspiracy theories..... Ebola is a racist disease because most that have died are black. Ebola is a disease
            created by western countries to kill black people, of all the people brought into
            the U.S., the only ones to die were black. And the vast majority of people that have
            died are black. The U.S. Does not give the same level of care to black people brought
            into the country with Ebola.</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">Who is the dipshtz standing next to the patient without any protective gear?</span></li>
      <li><span class="neutral">Maybe blacks are more affected by it than whites?</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">From the article: Experts have said all along it’s not unusual to get a negative test
            for Ebola the first time. It takes a while for the virus to build up in the blood.
            Smith said people usually develop fever about a week after infection. “If you check
            right then, often you get a false negative,” Smith told a news conference. “Usually
            you have fever for three to four days, then you start getting other symptoms like
            diarrhea, nausea and vomiting,” he added. That’s when patients then almost always
            test positive. If there’s enough virus in the blood to set off a positive test, it’s
            also enough to cause more advanced symptoms. So, wait, that Ebola Nurse Kaci said
            she was totally safe because she'd tested negative... yeah, about that...</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">He was an experienced doctor treating himself for Malaria in a place known for widespread
            Ebola??  So far it looks like defeating Ebola is easy, if treated early with IV fluids
            and keeping the electrolytes balanced. Why can't they do this in Africa?</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">Warn them in authority over you do the right thing.</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">What can it tell us?
            1)The SAFETY OFFICER in the photo drank too much coolaid.
            2)People with Ebola should be treated where they are when diagnosed. No more flying
            them into our country.
            3)Ebola sucks and we don't want it in our country at all.</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">Most people think Dr Martin Salia was a hero for treating Ebola patients in West African
            countries, risking his own health and life. Some people think he deserved treatment
            in the USA because he was a hero, and a legal US resident, and because "We can". Who
            thinks it was wise to bring someone in the end stage of the disease to the USA, when
            he was most infectious, just so his family could cremate or bury him here? Especially
            since in the end stage, care is strictly palliative, relieving pain and symptoms,
            making someone more comfortable before they die, without attempting to cure the patient.
            Why risk giving Ebola traction in America?</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">"But he hadn't been treating Ebola patients and he'd already come through a 21-day
            incubation period after a close call with an Ebola patient. And his first blood test
            for Ebola came back negative on November 7" So Nurse Stompyfoot has been completely
            vindicated in her proclamations that she posed absolutely zero chance of any risk
            to anyone since she had felt fine for a while and had a negative test.</span></li>

      <li><span class="negative">How sad for American journalism. Nothing on NBC about the deceit and lies by this
            administration and the cost of what it will be! Wake up America, NBC is still obamas
            stooge!</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">This should prove to be interesting. There will probably some sticker shock and awe
            about increased premium rates and higher deductibles. Any figures on how many of the
            young and healthy are not signing up, knowing that they don't have to worry about
            the penalty fee, unless they have a tax refund coming?
            It probably will never be repealed, but I am sure the Republicans will try to redo
            parts of it, and get rid of the medical equipment tax.</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">Step right up folks and get your Obamacare, the best health care in the land! And
            don't be fooled by cheap knockoff plans, make sure it says "Obamacare," and you'll
            know you are getting the best care possible.  That's "Obamacare," get yours today!!</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">Yes, when it comes to identifying actual problems with Obamacare, Republicans have
            SO much credibility: Ridiculously Insane Anti-Obamacare Ad</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">We the people pay for the revamped Obamacare website, we pay for subsidies for others
            who cannot afford the high deductibles on their new plans, we paid for the politicians
            who passed this overly complicated law, etc. Plus we pay our own higher premiums,
            higher deductibles, higher co-pays, etc. And we pay when jobs are lost, hours are
            cut, etc. We should willingly pay to get this debacle of a law repealed, and show
            we are smarter than the politicians and architects of this law who wrote it in a way
            to "obscure" its true nature from the "stupid" voters.</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">Time to enroll in 0bama/Gruber care. The people in government and its architect Gruber
            knew they had to have the support of stupid people and they got it.</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">Let it collapse on itself.   The SCOTUS will have to find for the actual WORDING of the law and not what the "intention" was.
            That will toss it back into the hands of Congress and it will be chipped away to nothing.</span></li>
      <li><span class="neutral">It does seem as if the primary purpose of the ACA was to insure that the perpetual
            poor have a direct road to medicaid especially if their primary disability is fitting
            into a minority class.</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">LOL...go ahead sign up for that crap. Like eating your own vomit. BTW where are the stories of the videotaped comments by Gruber of how its all an intentional
            load of crap but you're all too stupdi to know it?</span></li>
      <li><span class="neutral">ACA is quite popular among those who benefit from it. It is politically impossible
            to repeal it. The less popular parts of the law like penalties for not carrying insurance
            will never be enforced. If anything, subsidies will become more generous, cover more
            people including people illegally here and tourists. There'll be strictures on insurance
            companies to waive deductibles, abolish the concept of networks etc. A simple tweak
            to the licensing law will be done to require medical establishments and doctors to
            accept ACA plans, Medicaid etc. After all, can't the CEOs and doctors and the rich
            sacrifice a little? And while we're at it, why have the anti-people policy of making
            premium payments to keep coverage active? Why not force coverage to be automatic and
            cover all events, so one single monthly premium payment of $100 made one single time
            covers the person for life?</span></li>

      <li><span class="positive">I'll only believe it when there is a polygraph test from this current accuser.
            I won't condemn anyone who hasn't had their day in court.</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">SNL will have him on - Cosby refused &amp; stated he'd be the rape victim of bad comedy writing.</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">I have no idea about Cosby's guilt or innocence.  However, I do know that Mike Tyson,
            a convicted rapist and abuser, has a TV show and is often on other programs.  To me, that is beyond belief. </span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">The claims are back because he never did the time for the crimes.</span></li>
      <li><span class="positive">Cosby is rich &amp; famous &amp; respected.  Who better to use to get your 15 min. of fame
            by accusing him of rape and all the stories are the same?  He gave them herbal medicine?
            I'll concede he may have had sex with them.  Who knows?</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">Freaking NBC...of course they are going to come to the defense of Bill Cosby due to the fact that
            they made alot of money off "The Cosby Show"in the 80's....and it just so happens that they are about to release another sitcom with him being
            the star...so naturally they have to defend their Golden Goose....since Bill Cosby is one of the few entertainers that can attract all demographic groups!!!!!</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">Two reasons: Press time and money. Nothing else.</span></li>
      <li><span class="positive">I don't know if the accusations are true. I hope Mr. Cosby is innocent. But even if
            he never raped anyone, he is failing as a role model. I don't claim to have any expertise
            in the law. But one thing I do understand is psychology. I understand the behavior
            patterns of the accused, and whether it supports a pattern of guilt or innocence.
            I also understand the psychology of victims, and of why a rape victim may stay silent
            for years and only muster the courage to speak up later. Most importantly, I understand
            the psychology of the public. The public needs answers. That is precisely the reason
            why he should deal with the accusations again. If he is innocent, he needs to take
            responsibility to fight off these accusations. He signed up for the role of "role
            model" and now he needs to fulfill it. And if the accusations surface again in 5 years,
            he will owe it to the public to fight them yet again. That is the price of fame.</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">This seems a bit strange.  These women were drugged and raped and they did not immediately
            go to the police department and get examined to have this confirmed???  What the hell.  xxx years later you remember you were drugged and raped?  How do you even know
            you were raped if you were, as reported from your own lips, DRUGGED????  This is making absolutely no sense at all. 
            And most importantly.  A message to all your women seeking to hang around rich and
            famous guys.  Knock it off!!!  You will not be rich and famous by being a celebrity star-seeker.  You do not need
            to go back to ANY ONE's apartment alone, no matter how much money they have.  And if you do go, take a
            friend with you.  These are just women that want fame and glory and when it doesn't
            happen, all of a sudden they were raped or molested and needed to "keep it quiet".
            If you are under the impression that you have to "F**K* your way to the top, you will be one of these women in a few years.  Wake up!!!</span></li>

            who didn't like her jokes and political views may have had something to do with it.
            Of course all surgery is risky, and given her age, there was more risk. But anyone
            who wished her gone could've assumed that would deflect any investigation. I don't
            think she was "done in". What do you think?</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">Meaning Ms. Rivers will now sue the whizz out of the medical facility enriching herself
            and her attorneys, but mostly her attorneys.  This will do little to ensure that a
            mistake never happens again, if in reality, a mistake happened.</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">Who?? She's already forgotten.</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">Omg! My mouth is on the floor reading this! Bottom line. This clinic, it appears, suffers
            from not one oversight but a grotesque array of issues that push the border on non-compliance
            to a new low. Wow. Just Wow. The individuals involved in this procedure need to reach
            around and cop a good feel of their unravaged anal tissues because it's about to be
            scathed with hellish pursuit. And rightfully so!
            Foremost; what was going on in that procedure room. I am a critical care registered
            nurse to lay out my credentials, for my assessment of what went wrong if I'm to read
            into this story correctly...
            Strike one. No consent! Informed Consent wasn't obtained. Omg! You didn't even have her legal permission! Wow!
            Strike two. Who are all these people in the procedure room!!! What a nightmare! She will give you an autograph sowhen she wakes up! Omg. That's horrifyinonto many levels. People gawking at you while your unconscious!!!!! Who knows what they were doing, but it's unnerving at best.
            Strike three. How many ENTs does it take to screw in a light bulb?!
            2/3...or two and a third unpreviledged bloak to be exact. This whole procedure in
            my mind is this grotesque charade with people taking selfies at the patients bedside.
            It's after they have had too much fun and overlook her during this absolutely critical
            time that they bottom out her vitals, from an undoubted overdose of propofol. This
            along with no compensary or standby hemodynamic support is what caused her death.
            In layman's terms. They bottomed her vitals out on the sedation (which caused the
            decrease in BP). They could have easily corrected an over-... I'll say versus dosage due to misconception of the term. Give her some norepinephrine
            and stabilize the pressure before proceeding any further. But this isn't done. She
            bottoms out and we now have a critical condition which should have never happened.
            This clinic messed up big time. The discrepancy in medical documentation comes from
            no one person being in charge of this whole nightmare scenario. If there was, they
            did a pathetic job. No one knows how much propofol was administered?! Who is pushing
            drugs on her and why?! Where is her nurse?! You better be sure if she were my patient.
            No one better come near her with a syringe of anything without knowledge or immediate
            say so. This is why I ask. Who was in charge of 'her'. It appears no one was. It is
            semi the doctors fault, I mean legally it will be them because they... Geez. Well technically they didn't even assume liability because they don't have
            a legal consent. Smdh! So it seems some doctors (3 of them) are shouting out separate orders, no one in
            charge, in a room full of nonliscensed and licensed personel (who knows who was in
            there) . It's a wonder this place has even had its door opened this long before this
            type of situation occurred. It's an awful mess. All the power to the family and state
            and other regulatory agencies (OSHA and JACHO) who are going to go after this tip
            top group... They deserve it. So reach back and cop a good feel ladies and gents ... They are coming.</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">Joan died of greed, vanity and old age. period! Who could save that wretch anyway
            wasn't she like back from the dead a few times too many anyway.</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">After 15 years working in hospitals, I can say that this happens so much more frequently
            than people would believe. I know that this took place in a free standing clinic but
            it is still very similar to a hospital. Hospitals and doctors do their best to cover
            it up, and if they can't, both the hospital and doctor(s) then try and locate someone
            lower on the food chain to blame. Then, if that doesn't work, the hospital and doctors
            turn on one another. The point to this is that when a physician is actually held accountable
            it's usually because they can't find someone else to take the fall.</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">While I wish this had not happened (compassion), I have to say that if she didn't
            know the odds - after good lord knows how many surgeries to keep looking "young" -
            of being put to sleep for surgery ESPECIALLY the older you get, than she was the reason she died, not the doctors. Good grief!!
            She WAS NOT YOUNG. Look at her face.........surgery after surgery. Get over it. No one is immune to the possibility of death.</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">She was 81 years old give it a rest.</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">Melissa and a $hithouse full of lawyers are all going to get well over this.</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">This was not vanity, it was not plastic surgery. It was arrogance and complacency
            on the part of the physician and the clinic. She died as a result of receiving inadequate
            care. Airway procedures can be dicey. Barring no co-morbidities, she would have been
            better served at a more aptly prepared facility.</span></li>

      <li><span class="negative">Talk about cutting off your nose to spite your face.  There is an old saying...don't
            let the perfect be the enemy of the good. If your sole disagreement with Senator Portman
            is his stance on same-sex unions then you deserve to be a loser on Election Day.</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">Someday Portman will be appreciated for his endeavors, but not today. Mr. Rafferty,
            you said in your writing, " is beginning to feel the backlash from social conservatives
            as he prepares for his re-election campaign." That should be "social" conservatives,
            Fixed it or you.</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">"I will not cross that moral line to vote for him"---
            What Social Conservative idiots refuse to comprehend, is that allowing the same sex
            couples to marry poses no "moral threat" to them and others at all.
            According to these nuts, we should be passing laws and fines on those who engage in
            pre marital sex. The fact that their neighbors are allowed to engage in per-martial
            sex bothers them, according to their petty "logic".
            Should we then look for Candidates who promise to defend marital and or godly sex
            and "morally cleanse" America? Why do they cherry pick sins?
            Who is forcing these nuts to divorce their spouse to go marry someone of the same
            sex? Who is telling them to do anything that would cause them to "cross the moral
            line"?</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">I have several conservative friends. Most of my family votes Republican. Not one of
            them is against gay marriage. This will only increase. From now on, a GOP candidate
            that is virulently anti-gay will only have a shrinking number of folks who will support
            him or her. It's time for the GOP to come out of the Dark Ages on this issue. Voters
            such as myself have not voted Republican for decades due to their stances on social
            issues (among others, of course). I'd be much more likely to consider a Republican
            if they'd stop being ignorant when it comes to gay folks. It's way past time to stop
            the idiocy.</span></li>
      <li><span class="positive">Ideological purity is a requirement in today's GOP. It's refreshing to see at least
            one republican stand up to their hatred of gays.</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">I have read many good comments here but this is basically one group wanting to impose
            their morality on another group.  There is nothing American about such an idea and
            it goes against the freedom of (and from) religion clause in the US Constitution.
            Don't like gay marriage, then don't allow it in your religious institutions.  But
            your religious restrictions have no place in our government, and each and every citizen
            is entitled to the full protection and benefits of the law.  That includes those granted
            in the case of marriage. Marriage needs to be a legal union of two people, not a religious
            expression. </span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">National polls show the same thing.....at 94% opposition teabaggers are the #1 demographic which opposes equal rights for
            gays.   They're dumb bigots to the core and their real agenda is social conservatism
            and Christian sharia law, contrary to their claim that they're not concerned with
            social issues.    Teabaggers are really just warmed-over John Birchers and really
            represent just the most extreme right wing of the GOP.</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative"> The Very Reverend Pastor Larry Robinson's Christian outrage will  be abated when
            the Gay-abetting Portmans haul the vile spawn of their loins to the Village Common
            for public stoning.  While there's still a spark of life in this God-defying miscreant,
            he'll be burned at the stake.
            Pastor  Larry, like Cotton Mather, the Westboro Baptists, Liberty University-ites,
            ISIS, Ugandan Brothers-in-Christ, Taliban, Opus Dei, and Duck Dynasty know the True
            Words of Magic Sky Guy. The cursed disbelieving those Words, like the Portsmans, pere,
            mere et fils are Damned to Hell. Mind your manners, especially, you so-called "moderates,"
            Reverend Mr. Robinson may be visiting you next.
            Ramen, Ramen, Ramen, RAMEN!</span></li>
      <li><span class="negative">Bottom line:American "Christians" - aren't.</span></li>
      <li><span class="positive">It's good to see someone representing the GOP actually standing up for what the party
            claims to represent; among other things, equality, and keeping govt. out of people's
            personal lives.  Most GOP'ers preach about this equality for all, and then turn around
            and pick and choose who that applies to.</span></li>
