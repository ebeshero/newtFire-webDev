    <head>A TRUE ACCOUNT OF TALKING TO THE SUN AT FIRE ISLAND</head>
    <l n="1">The Sun woke me this morning loud</l>
    <l n="2">and clear, saying "Hey! I've been</l>
    <l n="3">trying to wake you up for fifteen</l>
    <l n="4">minutes. Don't be so rude, you are</l>
    <l n="5">only the second poet I've ever chosen</l>
    <l n="6">to speak to personally</l>
    <l n="7">                      so why</l>
    <l n="8">aren't you more attentive? If I could</l>
    <l n="9">burn you through the window I would</l>
    <l n="10">to wake you up. I can't hang around</l>
    <l n="11">here all day."</l>
    <l n="12">             "Sorry, Sun, I stayed</l>
    <l n="13">up late last night talking to <ref who="halFondren" friend="halFondren" from="uS">Hal</ref>." </l>
    <l n="14">"When I woke up <ref who="vladimirMayakovsky" writer="vladimirMayakovsky" from="russia">Mayakovsky</ref> he was</l>
    <l n="15">a lot more prompt" the Sun said</l>
    <l n="16">petulantly. "Most people are up</l>
    <l n="17">already waiting to see if I'm going</l>
    <l n="18">to put in an appearance."</l>
    <l n="19">                        I tried</l>
    <l n="20">to apologize "I missed you yesterday."</l>
    <l n="21">"That's better" he said. "I didn't</l>
    <l n="22">know you'd come out." "You may be</l>
    <l n="23">wondering why I've come so close?"</l>
    <l n="24">"Yes" I said beginning to feel hot</l>
    <l n="25">wondering if maybe he wasn't burning me</l>
    <l n="26">anyway.</l>
    <l n="27">       "Frankly I wanted to tell you</l>
    <l n="28">I like your poetry. I see a lot</l>
    <l n="29">on my rounds and you're okay. You may</l>
    <l n="30">not be the greatest thing on earth, but</l>
    <l n="31">you're different. Now, I've heard some</l>
    <l n="32">say you're crazy, they being excessively</l>
    <l n="33">calm themselves to my mind, and other</l>
    <l n="34">crazy poets think that you're a boring</l>
    <l n="35">reactionary. Not me.</l>
    <l n="36">                    Just keep on</l>
    <l n="37">like I do and pay no attention. You'll</l>
    <l n="38">find that people always will complain</l>
    <l n="39">about the atmosphere, either too hot</l>
    <l n="40">or too cold too bright or too dark, days</l>
    <l n="41">too short or too long.</l>
    <l n="42">                     If you don't appear</l>
    <l n="43">at all one day they think you're lazy</l>
    <l n="44">or dead. Just keep right on, I like it.</l>
    <l n="45">And don't worry about your lineage</l>
    <l n="46">poetic or natural. The Sun shines on</l>
    <l n="47">the jungle, you know, on the tundra</l>
    <l n="48">the sea, the ghetto. Wherever you were</l>
    <l n="49">I knew it and saw you moving. I was waiting</l>
    <l n="50">for you to get to work.</l>
    <l n="51">                       And now that you</l>
    <l n="52">are making your own days, so to speak,</l>
    <l n="53">even if no one reads you but me</l>
    <l n="54">you won't be depressed. Not</l>
    <l n="55">everyone can look up, even at me. It</l>
    <l n="56">hurts their eyes."</l>
    <l n="57">                 "Oh Sun, I'm so grateful to you!"</l>
    <l n="58">"Thanks and remember I'm watching. It's</l>
    <l n="59">easier for me to speak to you out</l>
    <l n="60">here. I don't have to slide down</l>
    <l n="61">between buildings to get your ear.</l>
    <l n="62">I know you love <ref neighborhood="manhattan" city="newYorkCity" state="newYork">Manhattan</ref>, but</l>
    <l n="63">you ought to look up more often.</l>
    <l n="64">                                And</l>
    <l n="65">always embrace things, people earth</l>
    <l n="66">sky stars, as I do, freely and with</l>
    <l n="67">the appropriate sense of space. That</l>
    <l n="68">is your inclination, known in the heavens</l>
    <l n="69">and you should follow it to hell, if</l>
    <l n="70">necessary, which I doubt.</l>
    <l n="71">                          Maybe we'll</l>
    <l n="72">speak again in <ref continent="africa">Africa</ref>, of which I too</l>
    <l n="73">am specially fond. Go back to sleep now</l>
    <l n="74">
        <ref writer="frankOHara" who="frankOHara" from="uS">Frank</ref>, and I may leave a tiny poem</l>
    <l n="75">in that brain of yours as my farewell." </l>
    <l n="76">"Sun, don't go!" I was awake</l>
    <l n="77">at last. "No, go I must, they're calling</l>
    <l n="78">me."</l>
    <l n="79">    "Who are they?"</l>
    <l n="80">                   Rising he said "Some</l>
    <l n="81">day you'll know. They're calling to you</l>
    <l n="82">too." Darkly he rose, and then I slept. </l>
