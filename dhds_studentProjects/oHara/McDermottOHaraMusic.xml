    <l n="1">    If I rest for a moment near <ref what="statue" who="williamTecumsehSherman" neighborhood="manhattan" city="newYorkCity" state="newYork">The Equestrian</ref>
    </l>
    <l n="2">pausing for a liver sausage sandwich in the <ref what="restaurant" neighborhood="manhattan" city="newYorkCity" state="newYork">Mayflower Shoppe</ref>,</l>
    <l n="3">that <ref what="statue">angel</ref> seems to be leading the <ref what="statue">horse</ref> into <ref what="fashionStore">Bergdorf's</ref>
    </l>
    <l n="4">and I am naked as a table cloth, my nerves humming.</l>
    <l n="5">Close to the fear of war and the stars which have disappeared.</l>
    <l n="6">I have in my hands only 35¢, it's so meaningless to eat!</l>
    <l n="7">and gusts of water spray over the basins of leaves</l>
    <l n="8">like the hammers of a glass pianoforte. If I seem to you</l>
    <l n="9">to have lavender lips under the leaves of the world,</l>
    <l n="10">    I must tighten my belt.</l>
    <l n="11">It's like a locomotive on the march, the season</l>
    <l n="12">    of distress and clarity</l>
    <l n="13">and my door is open to the evenings of midwinter's</l>
    <l n="14">lightly falling snow over the newspapers.</l>
    <l n="15">Clasp me in your handkerchief like a tear, trumpet</l>
    <l n="16">of early afternoon! in the foggy autumn.</l>
    <l n="17">As they're putting, up the Christmas trees on <ref neighborhood="manhattan" city="newYorkCity" state="newYork">Park Avenue</ref>
    </l>
    <l n="18">I shall see my daydreams walking by with dogs in blankets,</l>
    <l n="19">put to some use before all those coloured lights come on!</l>
    <l n="20">    But no more fountains and no more rain,</l>
    <l n="21">    and the stores stay open terribly late.</l>
    
    <!--I had to take away "what="store" what="apparel"" because apparently I can't have the attribute more than once... for Bergdorf's-->
    <!--the same goes for "neighboorhood="bronx"" on "Park Avenue"-->
