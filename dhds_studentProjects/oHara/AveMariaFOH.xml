    <head>AVE MARIA</head>
    <l n="1">Mothers of America</l>
    <l n="2">                  let your kids go to the movies!</l>
    <l n="3">get them out of the house so they won't know what you're up to</l>
    <l n="4">it's true that fresh air is good for the body</l>
    <l n="5">                                           but what about the soul</l>
    <l n="6">that grows in darkness, embossed by silvery images</l>
    <l n="7">and when you grow old as grow old you must</l>
    <l n="8">                                     they won't hate you</l>
    <l n="9">they won't criticize you they won't know</l>
    <l n="10">                                      they'll be in some glamorous country</l>
    <l n="11">they first saw on a Saturday afternoon or playing hookey</l>
    <l n="12">they may even be grateful to you</l>
    <l n="13">                               for their first sexual experience</l>
    <l n="14">which only cost you a quarter</l>
    <l n="15">                            and didn't upset the peaceful home</l>
    <l n="16">they will know where candy bars come from</l>
    <l n="17">                                        and gratuitous bags of popcorn</l>
    <l n="18">as gratuitous as leaving the movie before it's over</l>
    <l n="19">with a pleasant stranger whose apartment is in the Heaven on Earth Bldg</l>
    <l n="20">near the <ref what="bridge" neighborhood="manhattan" city="newYorkCity" state="newYork">Williamsburg Bridge</ref>
    </l>
    <l n="21">                           oh mothers you will have made the little tykes</l>
    <l n="22">so happy because if nobody does pick them up in the movies</l>
    <l n="23">they won't know the difference</l>
    <l n="24">                             and if somebody does it'll be sheer gravy</l>
    <l n="25">and they'll have been truly entertained either way</l>
    <l n="26">instead of hanging around the yard</l>
    <l n="27">                                 or up in their room</l>
    <l n="28">                                                    hating you</l>
    <l n="29">prematurely since you won't have done anything horribly mean yet</l>
    <l n="30">except keeping them from the darker joys</l>
    <l n="31">                                       it's unforgivable the latter</l>
    <l n="32">so don't blame me if you won't take this advice</l>
    <l n="33">                                             and the family breaks up</l>
    <l n="34">and your children grow old and blind in front of a TV set</l>
    <l n="35">                                                     seeing</l>
    <l n="36">movies you wouldn't let them see when they were young</l>
