								masses of land. In the Eastern hemisphere we find first that mass,
								which is commonly called the Old World, and which comprehends three
								large parts, bearing the appellation of Continents, and
								distinguished by the names of Europe, Asia, and Africa. The next in
								size, and in the order of time, when it was made known to European
								nations, is situated in the Western hemisphere, and called America.
								The third large mass of land lies in the South-East part of our
								hemisphere, and its Eastern limits have been but lately ascertained
								by that indefatigable and intelligent navigator, Capt. Cook, in the
								year 1770. Its Western and Northern limits were first discovered in
								1616 and the following years, by the Dutch navigators, when a noble
								spirit of discovery still animated the governors of their Indian
								settlements. Since that time it has been visited, and severally
								seen, by Dutch and English navigators, and the whole was called in
								1644 New-Holland, from its first discoverers. Perhaps many will
								dissent from me, and refuse to call it a Continent, though it be
								little, if at all, inferior to Europe, to which no one has hitherto
								hesitated to give that name. It must be allowed, that New-Holland is
								at present the most backward of all the lands called Continents, in
								point of population, and utility to Europe; but this objection is of
								little weight, since it may perhaps, in future ages, become as
								populous as any of the other continents, and equally useful; as I
								believe it to be very likely to supply the wants of European
								colonies.</p><p n="6">We know this land but imperfectly, and all our navigators seem to
								complain that it is deficient in fresh water and large rivers; but,
								had they properly and carefully examined its circuit, especially its
								South-Western shores, their enquiries would perhaps have been
								rewarded with success; for it is highly probable, that a land of so
								great extent contains high mountains in its interior parts; and
								wherever those are, there must be rivers. These would invite
								European settlers; especially such as would be willing to withdraw
								themselves from the oppressions of growing despotism in Europe.1 To
								such sons of liberty this continent would offer a new and happy
								asylum: by which means it might become the seat of sciences and
								arts; happy in its cultivation, the riches of its productions, and
								the number of its inhabitants.</p><p n="7">The rest of the lands, not comprehended under those now enumerated,
								are only islands. In our voyage we touched at the Cape of Good Hope
								in Africa: we saw only the last fragments of America along the coast
								of Tierra del Fuego, and besides these, our own continent from which
								we came, and to which we again returned. We have therefore nothing
								to say in particular relative to large lands, if we except a single
								remark, which we collected from the accounts of our friends on board
								the Adventure, who saw part of New-Holland in 1773. The Southernmost
								extremity of this continent has a great familiarity to all the
								Southern points and extremities of continents, and therefore appears
								black, rocky, and of considerable elevation;*<ref target="#jf1"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf1">* The Cape of Good Hope presents a high, bleak, and rocky point. Cape Comorin in India, and Cape Froward in America, are both of the same nature.</note></ref> though farther to the
								North, the country is even, and without any remarkably high hills,
								at least near the shores.</p><p n="8">I pretend not to defend any particular hypothesis relative to the
								theory of the earth; but, if we cast our eyes on the two hemispheres
								of our globe, such as they are known since our last voyage, they
								seem to offer some curious particulars to our view.</p><p n="9">All the remarkable Southern points of lands on our globe, have a
								great and striking similarity in regard to their conformation, and
								the situation of islands in their vicinity. They are all high and
								rocky; each seems to be the extremity of a range of high mountains
								running northward. All have to the Eastward one or more large
								islands. Nay, if we continue the comparison, all continents have a
								great sinuosity on the West-side towards the north. So many
								coinciding circumstances seem, not to be merely accidental, but
								rather to proceed from one and the same general cause. I do not
								pretend to point out this first cause, but cannot help suspecting,
								that a violent flood coming from the South-West has produced this
								striking identity of conformation in these lands, though I can
								neither point out the time when this great revolution happened, nor
								assign any reason for its operating in this manner. It suffices to
								have mentioned the fact, and hinted at the next cause, without any
								ostentation.</p><p n="10">America has the Andes running from the South to the North, and ending
								in Cape Froward, nay, extending even beyond the streight to Cape
								Horn. The sinuosity on its West-side is evident about the tropic of
								Capricorn, and to the East of its South-point are Tierra del Fuego,
								Staten Land, and the Falkland Islands.</p><p n="11">Africa, on its West coast, has a great sinuosity to the North of the
								Line. The high rocks of its Southern extremity at the Cape of Good
								Hope are continued by a long range of high mountains running in the
								direction of North East from the Cape. Madagascar, and several small
								islands, are to the East or North-East of its Southern
								extremity.</p><p n="12">Asia terminates at Cape Comorin in a high, rocky point, formed by the
								extremity of a chain of the mountains of Gatte: beyond Cambaya,
								towards the river Sind, there is a sinuosity similar to those
								already mentioned; and on the East-side of Cape Comorin is the
								island of Ceylon.</p><p n="13">New-Holland has a high rocky point on its Southern extremity, which,
								according to the accounts of Tasman and our last navigators, seems
								to be continued in a series of mountains extending a good way up to
								the North. Whosoever casts a glance on Africa and New-Holland, must,
								upon the whole, be struck with the similarity of their general
								outlines; the sinuosity to the West being very remarkable in both:
								and Eastward of New-Holland are the two large islands, which form
								New-Zeeland.</p></div><div type="chapter" n="2" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head><l>SECTION II</l><l>ISLANDS</l></head><p n="14">ALL the islands which we saw during our voyage are either situated
								within the tropicks, or in the temperate zones. The Tropical Islands
								may be again divided into high and low.</p><p n="15">The high Tropical Islands are either surrounded by reefs, and have
								flats near the sea-shore, or they are without reefs. Of the first
								kind are O-Taheitee with all the Society Isles and Maƒtea, the
								higher Friendly Isles Tongatabu, Eaoowe, Namocka, Turtle Island and
								new Caledonia.</p><p n="16">Amongst the highest Tropical Isles without a reef, we reckon the
								Marquesas and all the new Hebrides, together with Savage Island; and
								Tofooa and Oghao among the Friendly Isles.</p><p n="17">The Low Isles of which we have any knowledge, are Chain-Island and
								four other isles, which were perhaps seen by Mr. De Bougainville;
								also Tethuroa, Teoukea with four more called Palliser's Isle, Tupai,
								Mopeeha or Howe's Isles; Palmerstone's Isles, with Immer, one of the
								new Hebrides, and the Archipelago of the Low Friendly Islands.</p><p n="18">These isles are so different from each other in their nature, that we
								cannot help at first sight observing the striking and material
								difference. The Low Isles are commonly narrow, low ledges of coral
								rocks, including in the middle a kind of lagoon and having here and
								there little sandy spots somewhat elevated above high-water mark,
								whereon coco nuts and a few other plants will thrive: the rest of
								the ledge of rocks is so low, that the sea frequently flows over it
								at high and sometimes at low water. Several of the larger isles of
								this kind are regularly inhabited; some are only resorted to, now
								and then by the inhabitants of the neighbouring high isles, for the
								purposes of fishing, fowling and turtling; and some others are
								absolutely uninhabited, though they are furnished with coco
								nut-trees and are often resorted to in great flocks by man of war
								birds, boobies, gulls, terns and some petrels.</p><p n="19">The high islands of both kinds appear at a distance, like large hills
								in the midst of the ocean, and some of them are greatly elevated, so
								that their summits are seldom free from clouds. Those, which are
								surrounded by a reef and by a fertile plain, along the sea-shores,
								have commonly a more gentle slope; whereas the others are suddenly
								steep. It must be allowed, however, that the hills in some of the
								new Hebrides viz. Ambrrym, Sandwich Isle, Tanna and others have
								likewise in several places an easy ascent.</p><p n="20">The islands seen by us in the South Sea in the temperate Southern
								zone, are Easter Island, Norfolk Island, and new Zeeland, and these
								are all high, and have no reef surrounding them. Norfolk Island is
								however situated upon a bank extending more than ten or twelve miles
								round it. New Zeeland as far as we had an opportunity of examining
								it, consists of very high hills, of which some in the very interior
								parts have summits almost always involved in clouds, or when free,
								shewing their snowy heads at more than twenty or thirty leagues
								distance. The lower hills of the same islands are almost every where
								covered with woods and forests, and none but the higher summits
								appear to be barren.</p><p n="21">Tierra del Fuego as far as we could discover, appears to be a cluster
								of isles intersected by various deep sounds and channels. The land
								consists of craggy, bleak and steep rocks, whose summits are covered
								with eternal snow, especially in those interior parts which are less
								exposed to the mild and humid air of the sea. Its Easternmost side
								about the streights le Maire, has an easy slope, and is in some
								parts wooded. Staten Land has the same appearance as the barren part
								of Tierra del Fuego: nor was the snow wanting in the beginning of
								January or the very height of summer.</p><p n="22">Southern Georgia is an isle of about eighty leagues in extent,
								consisting of high hills, none of which were free from snow in the
								middle of January, except a few rocks towards the sea: and the
								bottoms of all its harbours we found filled with ice.</p><p n="23">The last land we saw in these cold, dismal regions we called Sandwich
								Land, and the Southernmost part of it, Southern Thule. All this land
								or cluster of isles, is full of ice and entirely covered with
								snow.</p><p n="24"><q><emph>- Pigris ubi nulla campis Arbor aestiva recreatur aura: Quod

								rocks; all the rest is a ponderous slate which contains some irony
								particles, lies in horizontal strata or nearly so, and is here and
								there perpendicularly intersected by veins of quartz.</p><p n="26">The rocks of Tierra del Fuego near the sea, are of the same nature
								and have on the higher parts, coarse granite rocks. (Saxum).</p><p n="27">The Southern isle of New Zeeland which we visited in two different
								places, is on its surface covered with a stratum of fine black light
								mould, formed of putrified mosses, deciduous leaves, and rotten
								trees (humus daedalea &amp; ruralis, Linnaei). This stratum is in
								some places about ten or twelve inches thick, but in general not so
								deep; under it we found an argillaceous substance nearly related to
								the class of talcous stones, which is turned into a kind of earth,
								by being exposed to the action of the sun, air, rain and frost, and
								is of various thickness: still deeper the same is indurated into
								stone, running in oblique strata dipping generally to the South:
								their hardness varies considerably, for some of the most indurated
								and compact will strike fire with steel. Their colour is generally a
								pale yellow, sometimes with a greenish hue. These strata are
								intersected perpendicularly or nearly so, by veins of white quartz
								(quarzum lacteum Linn.) and sometimes contain a green kind of stone
								of a lamellated structure, and nearly related to the talcous stones.
								On shingly beaches I have, though seldom, found a few black smooth
								stones of the flinty order, and some large detached pieces of a
								solid, ponderous, speckled grey or blackish green lava, employed by
								the natives to form their emittees, or weapons for close engagement.
								A few pumice-stones (pumex vulcani Linn.) were likewise collected on
								the shingly beaches of this isle: but whether they were thrown up by
								a volcano in the neighbourhood, or carried there from remote parts
								by the sea, I cannot determine. Among the fossil productions of this
								country, we must likewise reckon a green stone, which sometimes is
								opaque, and sometimes quite transparent, manufactured by the natives
								into hatchets, chissels, and ornaments, and seems to be of the
								nephritic kind (talcum nephriticum Linn.). This stone is commonly
								brought by the natives from the interior parts of Queen Charlotte's
								Sound to the South West, in which direction they pointed. We asked
								for its native place, and they called it Po‰namoo, from whence
								probably the abovementioned part of the country obtained the
								denomination of Tavai Po‰namoo: but next to Motoo-aroo, on the
								little islet, where the natives formerly had one of their hippa's or
								strong holds, this stone is found in perpendicular or somewhat
								oblique veins, of about two inches thickness, in the above-mentioned
								strata of talcous greyish stone. The nephritic is seldom solid or in
								large pieces, for the greatest fragments we saw, never exceeded
								twelve or fifteen inches in breadth, and about two inches in
								thickness. On the shores we commonly met with a blueish grey,
								argillaceous slate of a lamellated structure, easily crumbling to
								pieces, when exposed to the weather: sometimes this slate is more
								solid, ponderous, and of a darker colour, probably on account of
								some metallic irony particles, which I suppose it to contain. The
								fragments of this slate scattered on the beach our seamen call
								shingle. We found in Norfolk Island almost the same strata as in New
								Zealand, and also red and yellow fragments of a spungy lava: this
								island likewise contains the same plants and birds.</p><p n="28">Easter Island has strongly the appearance of a land that has lately
								undergone a great alteration by fire. All its rocks look black,
								burnt and cavernous, resembling slags or dross. The soil is a
								reddish brown, dusty mould, as if it had been burnt, and might with
								justice be deemed a kind of Puzzolana,*<ref target="#jf2"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf2">* See Ferber's travels through Italy, translated by Mr. Raspe, p. 130.</note></ref> spread with innumerable
								fragments of tarras stone, some rocks which I saw were of a brown or
								reddish ochreous volcanic tufa,=<ref target="#jf3"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf3">= See Ferber's travels, p. 128.</note></ref> (tophus tubalcaini Linn.) full of
								caverns, and some ferrugineous particles. Of this substance the
								gigantic statues of Easter Island are formed, and therefore they
								cannot be of very remote antiquity, as the stone is of an extremely
								perishable nature. On the South side of the isle, the whole cliff
								towards the sea for more than a quarter of a mile consists of solid
								ponderous rock of a honeycombed slag or lava, which may be expected
								to yield some portions of iron. Besides these, we saw several black
								glassy stones, which to mineralogists are known by the name of black
								agate (pumex vitres Linn.) found in Iceland,×<ref target="#jf4"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf4">× Ferber's travels, p. 158. Mr. Raspe's note.</note></ref> near the Vesuvio in
								Italy,Q<ref target="#jf5"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf5">Q Ferber's travels, p. 157.</note></ref> the Mongibello in Sicily, and on the Isle of Ascension;F<ref target="#jf6"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf6">F Cronsted's mineralogy, sect. 295. p. 269.</note></ref> in
								short in all the neighbourhoods of volcanos. We observed likewise a
								stony, light, spungy kind of lava, of a whitish grey colour.</p><p n="29">The Marquesas have a rocky shore, consisting of indurated clay; a
								ponderous, solid slate, of a blueish grey colour, containing some
								iron particles; and lastly a stony lava, which is either grey,
								spungy with lamellated, vitreous, pentagonal or hexagonal sherl, of
								a brownish and in some of a greenish, or of a blackish colour, with
								brownish and sometimes white starlike or radiated sherl. The surface
								of the soil is a clay mixed with mould, which the natives manure
								with shells. Under this mould is an earthy argillaceous substance,
								mixed with tarras and puzzolana. As we staid but a few days here, we
								had not much time to examine the higher parts of the isle.</p><p n="30">O-Taheitee and all the Society Isles are no doubt of the same nature.
								Their shores are coral rock extending from the reef encircling these
								isles to the very high-water mark. There begins the sand, formed in
								some places from small shells, and rubbed pieces of coral rock; but
								in others the shores are covered by a blackish kind of sand,
								consisting of the former sort mixed with black, sometimes shining
								and glittering particles of coarse daze or glist (Mica) and here and
								there some particles of refractory iron ores called in England Shim
								(ferrum micaceum, Linn.) and Kall (molybdaenum spuma lupi, Linn.).
								The plains from the shores to the foot of the hills, are covered
								with a very fine thick stratum of black mould, mixed with the
								above-mentioned kind of sand, and when the natives cultivate some
								spots for raising the inebriating pepper plant (piper methysticum)
								or the cloth plant (morus papyrisera) they often use shells as a
								kind of manure. The first and lower range of hills are commonly
								formed of a red ochreous earth (ochra martis Linn.) sometimes so
								intensely red, that the natives use it to paint their canoes and
								cloth: and in this earth I found here and there pieces, as I believe
								of the osteocella (tophus osteocolla Linn.). The higher hills
								consist of a hard, compact, and stiff clayey substance, which in the
								strata that are out of the reach of sun, air and rain, are hardened
								into a stone. There are at the top of the valleys, along the banks
								of the rivers, large masses of coarse granite stones (saxum) of
								various mixtures, and at a place of the same nature, near a cascade
								formed by the river Matavai, there are pillars of a grey, solid
								basaltes (nitrum basaltinum Linn.) and here and there I saw
								fragments of black solid basaltes or paragone, which the natives
								commonly employ to make their paste beaters, hatchets, chissels and
								cutting tools. At O-Aite-peha the natives brought me on board a kind
								of pyrites having the exact form of a stalactite, or of a substance
								that had been melted and congealed while running down. The existence
								of sulphureous pyrites confirms the account I was favoured with by
								the learned and ingenious Dr. Casimiro Gomez Ortega, F.R.S. the King
								of Spain's Botanist, and Intendant of the botanical garden at
								Madrid, intimating that the Spanish men of war, which had been at
								O-Taheitee, brought from thence a large mass of the finest
								crystalline transparent native sulphur, now placed in the royal
								cabinet of natural history at Madrid. At the top of the numerous
								valleys, which intersect these isles, are large, rocky masses, black
								and cavernous, full of various white and other specks of sherl, in a
								word, real lava. There is likewise a grey, stalactitic, porous lava
								to be met with, which contains black sherls, and lastly we found an
								argillaceous, lamellated iron stone of a dull reddish brown
								colour.</p><p n="31">The Friendly Islands have, in my opinion, the same soil as the
								Society Isles; with this difference only, that they are not so high
								or so rocky as the latter. When we came to A-Namocka in the year
								1774, we saw on the isle of Tofo•a a smoke in the morning, which
								appeared fiery at night. When we passed between it and O-Gh...o, we
								observed great clouds of smoke rising from the middle of the isle,
								attended with a smell similar to that produced by burnt turf; some
								particles filled the atmosphere, and fell down on the ship, and
								coming in contact with the eye, occasioned an acute pain. On the
								North side of the isle we saw a large place with the evident
								appearance of being lately burnt by fire. On the shores of
								A-Namocka, pumice-stones were frequently thrown up by the sea. The
								natives of all these isles used likewise pieces of black, solid
								basaltes for hatchets and tools, as in the Society Isles. Among the
								fishing implements of these islanders, we found conic pieces of
								calcareous stone; but we could not determine whether they were made
								of spar, or of coral-rock: though I am inclined to believe these
								cones to be a kind of sparry substance.</p><p n="32">The soil of the New-hebrides seems to be very much of the same kind
								with that in the above islands.</p><p n="33">At Mallicollo, it appeared to consist rather of a yellowish clay,
								mixed with common sand. The rocks along the sea-shore, are formed of
								corals and madrepores; and higher up of an indurated clay. The isle
								of Ambrrym has certainly one, if not two, volcanos; and we found
								pumice-stones on the opposite shores of Mallicollo. Irromanga we saw
								only at a distance, and it seemd to be much of the same nature with
								the former isles. Tanna has on its shores coral rocks and
								madrepores: the beaches are covered with a blackish sand, consisting
								of minute pieces of sherl and pumice-stone, which are formed by the
								ashes constantly thrown up by a volcano, and scattered over the
								whole surface of the island (Pumex cinerarius, Linn.). The surface
								of the whole isle consists therefore of this pumice-sand mixed with
								a black mould formed by the putrified vegetables. The pumice-sand is
								very abundant; for there is at certain times, several leagues
								distant from the volcano, not a leaf of any tree or plant, nor any
								grass, which is not entirely covered with ashes, which I examined,
								and found to be this very pumice-sand: however, this forms a most
								admirable ashy, fertile soil, in which all vegetables thrive with
								the greatest luxuriance. We found a few single detached rock-stones;
								being a mixture of quartz and black daze or mica; nay, one of these
								pieces was a coarse dissolved granite, covered with black
								button-ore, which is a sort of iron-ore.</p><p n="34">The chief strata of the isle, as far as I could form a judgment of
								them, from the various cliffs surrounding the harbour, are of a clay
								mixed with aluminous earth, interspersed with lumps of pure chalk.
								The strata of the clay are about six inches more or less, deviating
								very little from the horizontal line. In a few places I found a
								soft, blackish sand-stone, composed of the ashes spread by the
								volcano, and some parts of clay. Here and there I observed a
								substance commonly called rotten-stone, which is a brown clayey
								tripoli; and, between the rotten-stone and the above-mentioned
								sand-stone, is a stratum containing both mixed together. High on the
								sides of the hills towards the volcano, I found a whitish,
								argillaceous substance, through which aqueous and sulphureous
								steams, from the very neighbourhood of the volcano, were continually
								rising, and made the place intensely hot: its taste is styptic, and
								I believe aluminous.*<ref target="#jf7"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf7">* All the neighbourhood of the solfataras in Tanna contains volcanic productions. The stones near it are lavas; the sand consists of volcanic ashes, and the soil is clay mixed with this sand. It is therefore beyond any doubt, that the clayey white substance, found in the very spiraculum, is nothing but a new modification of the volcanic productions. The first who ever had this idea, that clays are produced by an operation of the vitriolic acid vitrescent or vitrified substances, is the ingenious Mr. Beaum‚, who founded it on a series of experiments. But the very first, who applied this idea to the great operations of nature in the solfataras, is Mr. Ferber, the most intelligent, and most accurate mineralogical writer of this age, which may be seen more at large in his xith letter, dated February 17, 1772, published in his Travels through Italy, translated by Mr. Raspe. Sir William Hamilton, that indefatigable observer of volcanos, had already examined the solfataras in 1771; but he seems, at that time, not to have had the least intimation of this remarkable process; since, in his letter to Dr. Maty, dated March 5, 1771, he calls the operation going forward at the solfatara a calcination: and he mentions to have seen half of a large piece of lava perfectly calcined , while the other half, out of the reach of the vapours, has been untouched; and in four pieces, the centre seems to be already converted into true marble. These whitish clays might, even by their appearance, says Mr. Ferber, p. 165, be mistaken for lime-stone; no wonder, therefore, that they should suggest the idea of calcination and of true marble.</note></ref> Some native sulphur was to be seen in this
								earth, together with several green specks or marks of copper. Under
								these solfataras1 (which, at each eruption from the volcano, emitted
								greater quantities of hot steams), are several hot wells, close to
								the high-water mark, which, however, seem not to be in the least
								sulphureous. I found likewise, in the vicinity of the hot steaming
								places or solfataras, a red ochre, or vitriolic earth, similar to
								the colcothar vitrioli, used by the natives for painting their
								faces. Everywhere in the isle we met with pumice-stones of purple,
								black, and white colour, and of different specific gravity. On the
								South-side of the isle is a cliff, in which I found several pieces
								of lava, some of which were black and solid, others porous and
								filled with greenish and white sherl crystals; others were grey and
								porous, containing yellow and black sherl. Besides these, we found a
								reddish lava or tarras, very light and similar to a pumice-stone. On
								the shores were calcareous tophi to be met with, containing several
								nidi of pholades.</p><p n="35">The neighbouring isle of Anattom, I suppose to contain likewise
								volcanic productions, as well as Tanna, because the natives of the
								latter had hatchets of black, solid basaltes or paragone, and said
								they came from Anattom, to distinguish them from hatchets made of a
								white shell, and which came from the isle of Immer:2 the first kind
								they called Pah...-bttas, and the latter Pah...-b-shan. To our iron
								hatchets they gave the first name.</p><p n="36">New-caledonia, and its adjacent isles, are surrounded by a reef of
								coral rocks and madrepores. The shores consist of shell-sand and
								particles of quartz. The soil is, in the plains, a black mould mixed
								with the above sand, and when watered and cultivated, very fertile.
								The sides of the hills, which I visited, are composed of a yellow
								ochreous clay, richly spangled with small particles of cat-silver,
								or a whitish kind of daze (Mica argentea. Linn.). The higher parts
								of the hills consist of a stone, called by the German miners
								gestell-stein, composed of quartz and great lumps of the above
								cat-silver (Saxum quarzo &amp; mica argentea compositum.). The
								cat-silver is sometimes of an intensely red or orange colour, by
								means of an iron-ochre. To the West of our anchoring-place, near the
								shore, are large, extremely hard masses of a blackish-green
								horn-stone (talcum corneum. Linn.) full of small pieces of garnets,
								of the size of a pin's head (Saxum corneum, granatis mixtum). In
								several places, fragments of white and very transparent quartz,
								sometimes tinged red in the cracks, are found scattered: these
								stones the natives contrive to break in such a manner, that a sharp
								edge is produced, and use them to cut their hair. The natives carry
								stones for their slings in small bags. These stones are of an oblong
								roundish figure, and pointed at both ends, consisting of a kind of
								soap-rock or smectites. Besides these, we met with some coarse,
								fibrous, greenish asbestos.</p><p n="37">If I except the coral rocks and madrepores, which form the shores of
								a great many of these isles, I cannot say, that I met with a single
								petrefaction of any denomination, in all, the isles we visited in
								the course of our expedition.</p><p n="38">From the above account it appears, I think, evidently, that all the
								tropical high isles of the South-Sea have been subject to the action
								of volcanos. This is strongly confirmed by the actual ignivomous3
								mountains, which we observed at Tofo•a, Ambrrym, and Tanna.</p><p n="39">Pyritical and sulphureous substances, together with a few iron-stones
								and some vestiges of copper, are no doubt found in several of them:
								but the mountains of New-Caledonia are the most likely to contain
								the richest metallic veins; and the same opinion, I suspect, may be
								formed of the mountains in New Zeeland. For the metallic substances,
								in all the other volcanic isles are probably destroyed and scorified
								by the violence of the subterraneous fire: those in New-Caledonia
								and New-Zeeland seem to be as yet undisturbed, as the species of
								fossils prevailing in these two isles are substances, which
								mineralogists have hitherto looked upon as primogenial, in which all
								the metallic veins*<ref target="#jf8"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf8">* I speak of veins only, and not of flatt-work or floors, which contain likewise sometimes metallic ores, but have an origin different from that of the primogenial mountains.</note></ref> on our globe are constantly found. We can offer
								nothing besides this general, but probable, conjecture; as our short
								stay, and the multiplicity of other business, prevented us from
								enquiring more minutely into the nature of the fossil productions of
								these isles.</p></div><div type="chapter" n="4" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head><l>SECTION IV</l><l>MOUNTAINS</l></head><p n="40">IF we examine the isles, visited by us in the different seas, which
								we navigated, it will appear, that they all ought to be considered
								as a range of submarine mountains: for, if the bottom of the sea is
								to be looked upon as land, these isles certainly are elevations or
								rising grounds; and therefore, as they are so near one another, and
								lying in the same direction, they can be nothing but chains of
								mountains. I will at present, therefore, only give an idea of the
								various ranges of these submarine elevations, which fall under the
								above description.</p><p n="41">When we were at the Cape of Good Hope, in November, 1772, we were
								informed, that the French had discovered some land in the Southern
								Indian ocean, about the meridian of Mauritius, and the latitude of
								4° South. After having gone beyond the antarctic circle, we hauled
								up towards the above situation, and found no land; but, from all
								concurring circumstances, it was highly probably, that we had been
								at no great distance from it. At our return to the Cape in March,
								1775, we found there Capt. Crozet, who had made a voyage on
								discovery with the unfortunate Capt. Marion,1 and had found several
								small isles and a large one, all lying in a direction from West to
								East, or nearly so: these isles, and those seen by Mr. de Kerguelen,
								are expressed in a chart published under the patronage of the Duc de
								Croy, by Robert de Vaugondy.2 Though we had not the good luck to
								fall in with them, we have, however, no reasons to disbelieve their
								existence; and probably their situation will be ascertained by that
								able and indefatigable navigator, Capt. Cook, in the expedition in
								which he at present is employed. These isles seem to be a series or
								chain of submarine mountains, running nearly from West to East. The
								lands, visited by us and others, in the Southern parts of the
								Atlantic ocean, are Sandwich Land, South-Georgia, Falkland Islands,
								and Staten Land, together with the broken lands belonging to Tierra
								del Fuego, and these form another chain of submarine mountains,
								lying almost in the same direction with the former. The low isles to
								the East of O-Taheitee, with the Society Isles, the Friendly Isles,
								the New-Hebrides, and New-Caledonia, together with the intermediate
								isles of Scilly, Howe, Palliser, Palmerstone, Savage, and
								Turtle-Island, as well as the isles of Hope and Cocos, Capt.
								Carteret's Queen Charlotte-Isles, and several more, as far as
								New-Hibernia, New-Britain, and New-Guinea, are one great chain of
								submarine mountains; extending through an immense space, or
								three-fourths of the whole South-Sea.</p><p n="42">Norfolk-Island, and New-Zeeland, seem to belong to a range of
								mountains branching out from the great chain, and running from North
								to South. If we consider this direction of isles or submarine
								mountains, it should seem they were designed to give greater
								solidity and strength to the compages of our globe.</p><p n="43">The next circumstance relative to the mountains is their height. The
								highest of all the mountains, which we saw in the course of this
								voyage, is, in my opinion, Mount Egmont, on the Northern isle of
								New-Zeeland, whose summit was covered with snow a great way down,
								and almost constantly capt with clouds; though at intervals we saw
								its top very distinctly.</p><p n="44">In France, in about 4° of North latitude, the line of eternal snow is
								found at the height of about 3280 or 3400 yards above the level of
								the sea. On the Pico de Teyde, on the isle of Teneriffe, in about 2°
								of North latitude, the snow is to be met with at the height of 4472
								yards. Mount Egment is very nearly in 3° of South latitude: but, as
								we constantly found, that in Southern latitudes the cold is much
								more intense than in the corresponding degrees of the Northern
								hemisphere, I will suppose the climate of Mount Egmont equal to that
								of France, and therefore the line of snow to be at the height of
								3280 yards; and, as the snow seemed to occupy one third of its
								height, the mountain will be 4920 yards high, or 14,760 feet, which
								is somewhat less than Dr. Heberden3 found the Pico of the isle of
								Teneriffe*<ref target="#jf9"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf9">* The Chevalier de Borda has in August, 1776, measured the height of the Peak of Teneriffe, and found it to be 1931 French toises = 12,340 English feet, and very near the same quantity he obtained by trigonometrical measurement. Dr. Heberden's operations gave 15,396 English feet as the height of the Peak of Teneriffe. Phil. Trans. vol. xlvii. p. 356. The same Dr. Heberden remarks there that the Sugar-loaf, or la Pericosa, is an eighth part of a league to the top, and that it is covered with snow the greatest part of the year. Deducting, therefore, 1980 feet = to one eighth part of a league, from 15,396 feet, the total for the height of the Peak according to Dr. Heberden, there remain 13,416 feet = 4472 yards, to the line of snow. Or, if these 1980 feet be deducted from 12,340, or the height according to the Chev. Borda, there remain 10,360 feet = 3453 yards, as the line of snow in about 28° and some odd minutes North latitude.</note></ref> to be. The summits of the other mountains, in the
								interior parts of New-Zeeland, both in Queen Charlotte's Sound and
								in Dusky Bay we found constantly covered a good way down with
								eternal snow.</p><p n="45">We observed these snow capt heads all the way along, when we sailed
								from Dusky Bay to Queen Charlotte's Sound in May, in the year 1773,
								and we took notice of the same circumstance in the same year in
								October, on the other side of the Southern isle, when contrary
								storms brought us a good way along its South East shore, almost as
								far as Banks's Island. This I believe, sufficiently proves, that
								these mountains form, as it were, one continued chain, running
								throughout the whole Southern Isle, and that they are little
								inferior in height to twelve or fourteen thousand feet. This long
								series of mountains, running in the same direction, gives room for a
								probable conjecture, that the metallic veins, which in all
								likelihood are to be met within the mountains of New Zeeland, are of
								a very rich and valuable nature.</p><p n="46">The hills of Tierra del Fuego, Staten Land, South Georgia, and
								Sandwich Land are constantly covered with snow; however, in the two
								first only the summits of the hills had snow, but in the latter the
								snow and ice reached in most places to the very edge of the sea, in
								the midst of their summer; which certainly proves the extreme rigour
								of the climate, as the line of eternal snow comes down so low. What
								is still more remarkable, this happened in isles surrounded by the
								moist and therefore mild sea air, which undoubtedly weakens the
								intenseness of the frost, and commonly mitigates the rigour of the
								climate.</p><p n="47">The mountain in the middle of the great peninsula of O-Taheitee or of
								Tobreonoo, is as far as I can form any idea, the highest of all the
								mountains in the Tropical Isles: it is in some places of an easy and
								gentle slope, and intersected by numerous and very deep valleys,
								converging towards the middle of the isle, where its summits are to
								be met with. The highest point of this hill is at a very just
								estimate, about seven miles from Point Venus. According to Captain
								Cook's map, it seems to be nine miles distant from thence; but as I
								have been twice up to this hill, I rather think the distance in the
								map to be too great; and the more so, as the valley, wherein
								Matavai-river runs, scarcely extends at its very extremity to more
								than six miles, and this valley is almost at the same distance from
								the sea, with the highest part of the hill. Mr. Wales our Astronomer
								took from his observatory on Point Venus the height of the hill, by
								the astronomical quadrants, and found it to be exactly 1° above the
								level of the sea; for the observatory is but a few feet above that
								level. If we allow these premises to be right, it will follow from a
								trigonometrical calculation, that this hill is 9565 feet high.*<ref target="#jf10"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf10">* If the effect of refraction be taken into the account, then the height will be 9530 feet; if nine miles distant, then the hill is 12,250 feet high.</note></ref></p><p n="48">The little Peninsula of O-Taheitee or T‚arraboo, has likewise hills
								towards its centre, but their summits are so steep, so craggy and so
								like spires in some instances, that the sight of these convinces the
								beholder, that they have undergone a great convulsion from violent
								causes, and especially subterraneous fire. The hills in all the
								other Tropical Isles are very moderate, and at least one third less
								than those of Tobreonoo. Though they be high enough to attract the
								clouds, and often to have their summits involved in them, they are
								however far removed from the line of eternal snow, which in Peru
								under the line, was found to be at 5,340 yard above the ocean. These
								observations on the difference of the line of eternal snow, give us
								an opportunity of communicating some hints or conjectures on the
								causes of this difference. First it appears that the beams of the
								sun falling more vertical on the earth, cause a greater degree of
								heat, and in proportion as they fall in a more oblique direction,
								they produce less warmth: secondly the nearer to the general level
								of the earth, the more is the atmosphere heated, probably the beams
								being there reflected from the unequal surface of the earth, and
								crossing one another in various directions cause greater warmth; and
								moreover the atmosphere being denser and more filled with vapours
								near the common level of the earth, when once warmed to a certain
								degree, preserves the heat for a longer time.=<ref target="#jf11"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf11">= Inferiora quoque tepent, primum terrarum halitu, qui multum secum calidi affert deinde quia radii solis replicantur &amp;amp; quousque redire potuerunt, replicato calore benignius fovent. Seneca Nat. Quaest. l. 2. c. X.4</note></ref> The contrary must
								take place in a situation more remote from the common level of the
								earth, where the atmosphere is thinner and less capable of retaining
								the warmth. These two principles will contribute to explain the
								phenomenon. Under the tropicks, the atmosphere and surface of the
								earth is more heated than towards the poles, because the sun
								operates at the first place more vertically, and at the other more
								obliquely, and therefore less effectually: the hills being under the
								line in a more heated atmosphere, the line of eternal snow, is there
								naturally more removed from the common level of the earth, than
								towards the poles, where the air is neither so intensely nor so
								constantly heated, which consequently brings the line of eternal
								snow much lower.</p><p n="49">The atmosphere being a fluid environing our globe, must consequently
								be subject to all the laws of nature to which the whole globe is
								subject. As the power of gravity near the equinoctial line is known
								to be less than towards the poles, the atmosphere naturally must be
								less attracted between the tropicks than beyond them; and
								consequently being besides more heated and therefore more rarefied,
								it must extend to a greater height between the tropicks; and
								probably this may contribute, with the before mentioned causes,
								towards removing there the line of eternal snow to a greater
								distance from the common level of the earth.</p><p n="50">The probably causes, of the Southern hemisphere being colder in
								corresponding degrees of latitude, than the Northern hemisphere,
								shall be explained in the section, wherein we speak of the formatica
								of ice.</p></div><div type="chapter" n="5" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head><l>SECTION V</l><l>FORMATION OF SOIL</l></head><p n="51">THE Tropical Isles have all the appearance of a long existence and
								fertility. But the Southernmost parts of New-zeeland, Tierra Del
								Fuego, Staten-land, Southern-georgia and Sandwich-land are still
								unimproved, and in that rude state in which they sprung up from the
								first chaos; with this distinction, that the farther you proceed
								towards the line and the climates capable of being assisted by the
								benevolent influence of the sun, the greater advances you discover
								towards improvement and fertility.1</p><p n="52">All the various particles of mineral bodies whatsoever are dead, and
								only the organic bodies of vegetables and animals are capable of
								life. Wherever we meet the first only, there nature has all the
								appearance of barrenness, the horrors of desolation and silence of
								death. But the least addition of vegetation enlivens the scene, and
								even the slow motions of unwieldy and torpid seals and grave
								pinguins on the shore, infuse life and chearfulness into the
								beholder. But when the surface of a land is clad with plants and
								diversified with birds and animals, then first we have an idea of
								the vivifying powers of nature and its great Lord. This previous
								observation therefore, will enable us to form a just idea of each of
								the above unimproved, rude lands. The barren bleak rocks of
								Sandwich-island seem not to be covered by the least atom of mould,
								nor is there any vestige of vegetation to be seen: immense loads of
								eternal snow, bury these barren rocks, as if doomed to be under the
								curse of nature, and continual fogs involve it in perpetual
								darkness.*<ref target="#jf12"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf12">* Pliny's words, Hist.

								covered with greens, and in Possession Bay we saw two rocks, where
								nature has just begun her great work, in producing organic vegetable
								bodies, and in forming a thin coat of soil, on the tops of barren
								cliffs; and so sparing was she of these her presents, that no more
								than two plants would vegetate here, the one a grass (Dactylis
								glomerata) and the other a kind of burnet (Sanguisorba.)</p><p n="54">To Tierra Del Fuego, the next land to the Westward, I will join
								Staten-Land on account of the great similarity they bear to each
								other, in the general face of the country. In the cavities and
								crevices of the huge piles of rocks forming these lands, where a
								little moisture is preserved by its situation, and where from the
								continued friction of the loose pieces of rocks, washed and hurried
								down the steep sides of the rocky masses, a few minute particles,
								form a kind of sand; there in the stagnant water gradually spring
								up, a few algaceous plants from seeds carried thither on the feet,
								plumage, and bills of birds: these plants form at the end of each
								season a few atoms of mould, which yearly increases: the birds, the
								sea, or the wind carries from a neighbouring isle, the seeds of some
								of the mossy plants to this little mould, and they vegetate in it
								during the proper season. Though these plants be not absolute
								mosses, they are however nearly related to them in their habit: we
								reckon among them the Ixia pumila; a new plant which we called
								Donatia, a small Melanthium, a minute Oxalis and Calendula, another
								little dioicous plant, called by us Phyllachne, together with the
								Mniarum.*<ref target="#jf13"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf13">* See Forster. Nova Genera Plantarum.</note></ref> These plants, or the greater part of them, have a peculiar
								growth, particularly adapted to these regions, and fit for forming
								soil and mould on barren rocks. In proportion as they grow up, they
								spread into various stems and branches, which lies as close together
								as possible: they spread new seeds, and at last a large spot is
								covered; the lowermost fibres, roots, stalks and leaves gradually
								decay and push forth on the top new verdant leaves: the decaying
								lower parts form a kind of peat or turf, which gradually changes
								into mould and soil. The close texture of these plants, hinders the
								moisture below from evaporating, and thus furnishes nutriment to the
								vegetation above, and clothes at last whole hills and isles with a
								constant verdure. Among these pumilous plants, some of a greater
								stature begin to thrive, without in the least prejudicing the growth
								of these creators of mould and soil. Among these plants we reckon a
								small Arbutus, a diminutive myrtle, a little dandelion, a small
								creeping Crassula, the common Pinguicula alpina, a yellow variety of
								the Viola palustris, the Statice armeria, or sea pink, a kind of
								burnet, the Ranunculus lapponicus, the Holcus odoratus, the common
								celery, with the Arabis heterophylla. Soon after we observed in
								places that are still covered with the above-mentioned mossy plant,
								a new rush (Juncus triglumis) a fine Amellus, a most beautiful
								scarlet Chelone, and lastly, even shrubby plant, viz. a scarlet
								flowered, thrubby plant of a new genus, which we called Embothrium
								coccincum; two new kinds of berberis, (Berberis ilicifolia &amp;
								mitior); an arbutus with cuspidated leaves (Arbutus mucronata) and
								lastly the tree bearing the Winter's bark (Drimys winteri) which
								however in these rocky barren parts of Tierra del Fuego never
								exceeds the size of a tolerable shrub; whereas in Success Bay, on a
								gentle sloping ground, in a rich and deep soil it grows to the size
								of the largest timber. The falling leaves, the rotting mossy plants,
								and various other circumstances increase the mould and form a deeper
								soil, more and more capable of bearing larger plants. Thus they all
								enlarge the vegetable system and rescue new animated parts of the
								creation from their inactive, chaotic state.</p><p n="55">I cannot pass over in silence the peculiar growth of one species of
								grass on New Year's Isle, near Staten Land, and which we likewise
								observed at South-Georgia: it is the well-known Dactylis glomerata,
								or one of its varieties. This grass is perennial, and bears the
								rigours of the coldest winters: it grows always in tufts or bunches,
								at some distance from each other. Every year the shoots form, as it
								were, a new head, and enlarge the growth of the bunch, till at last
								you see these bunches of the height of four or five feet, and at the
								top two or three times broader than at the bottom. The leaves and
								stalks of the grass are strong, and often three or four feet long.
								Under these tufts the ursine seals and penguins take shelter; and,
								as they come so often dripping out of the sea, they make the lanes
								between the tufts extremely dirty and muddy, so that a man cannot
								walk, except on the tops of the tufts. In other places the shags
								(Pelecanus carunculatus) take possession of these tufts, and make
								their nests on them; so that by this grass, and the excrements of
								seals, penguins, and shags, the soil of the country gradually
								becomes more and more elevated.</p><p n="56">In the Southern parts of New Zeeland we find the formation of mould
								and soil much more forward, because its climate is milder, the
								summer longer, and vegetation more quick and strong: but, upon the
								whole, we observe the same analogy in its origin. All sorts of ferns
								and of small mossy plants, especially the Mniarum, occupy large
								spots; which, by their continual spreading and yearly decay,
								increase the mould, and thus form a soil for the reception of
								numerous shrubs. Their foliage every year putrifies, and accumulates
								the precious treasure of fertile mould, in which at last the largest
								trees grow to an immense extent and bulk; till, decaying by old age,
								a violent, impetuous storm breaks them down; and they, in their
								fall, crush numberless bushes and shrubs, that pass together into a
								state of putrefaction, and afford space and nutriment for a whole
								generation of young trees, which must in their turn decay, to make
								room for others.3 All this seeming scene of destruction and
								confusion is one of the oeconomical actions of nature, thus hoarding
								up a precious quantity of the richest mould, for a future generation
								of men, who, one day or other, will live upon the rich products of
								this treasured soil.</p><p n="57"><q><emph>Terra nos nascentes excipit, natos alit, semelque editos

								were little cavities under them, we cleared them of the rubbish, and
								after the water had filled the cavities and overflowed for some
								time, I took my portable thermometer, with Fahrenheit's scale, made
								by Mr. Ramsden3 (which had been that day, in my cabin, at 7° and
								which, having been carried close to my body in a pocket, I found at
								8°), and having placed it in the hot well, so that the whole bulb
								and tube were covered, the quicksilver rose soon to 19°, but after
								having been for five minutes in the well, it did not rise above that
								degree. I took the thermometer out, and cleared the well still
								better, and made the excavation of the stone below deeper, and then
								immersed it again during ten minutes, but found it all the time at
								19°. This was done August the 17th, 1774, at 4h 30' P.M. at
								high-water. We returned the next morning about nine o'clock, when
								the water was low; and, upon immersing the thermometer as before, we
								observed the quicksilver to rise to 18° in the space of one minute
								and a half; at which degree it remained, though the thermometer
								continued several minutes longer in the water. I threw some small
								fish, and some muscles, into the hot water, and they were boiled in
								a few minutes. The water is clear and limpid, and has no peculiar
								taste, except that I thought it to have a very faint astringency. I
								put a piece of fine and bright silver into it, which having lain for
								more than an hour in it, came out untarnished. I put a small
								quantity of solution of salt of tartar in it, but it did not
								precipitate any thing, though I increased the quantity of the
								tartar. I had no other substances with me to try the water by other
								methods.</p><p n="61">On the same cliff, but close to the sandy beach, at the bottom of the
								harbour, there are two other hot springs. We came on the same
								morning, Aug. the 18th, half an hour later, to these springs. I
								hollowed out the sand to gather some of the hot water, and immersed
								my thermometer just at the place where the water bubbles up, and in
								about two minutes time the quicksilver rose to 20°, and remained for
								several minutes in the water without rising higher. On the same
								cliff, on a brow about 60 or 80 fathoms higher, we found a place
								clear of trees, where in cool weather, especially after rain, we
								could discover from the ship, steams rising, which were still more
								distinctly observed when we came close to the place. We found
								ourselves, after a few minutes stay, in a profuse perspiration,
								occasioned by the hot steams, and the heat of the ground we stood
								on, which in some places was intolerable. When the volcano made an
								explosion, we always saw a new quantity of vapours and steams pierce
								these spiracula, which are apparently shut up, but seem to have a
								cavity underneath; for the whole mountain gave a hollow sound, when
								we were walking on the footpath leading to these solfataras; and I
								likewise traced a train of these spiracula, both above and below on
								the sides of this hill, as far as within a few yards of the hot
								wells. I saw the solfataras three times. The second time I took my
								thermometer with me, and having dug a hole about a foot deep, I hung
								the thermometer in it by the ribbon on its top, to a stick laid
								across the hole; and I saw it rise from 8° in a few seconds to 17°:
								having left the thermometer for four minutes in the hole, I found it
								still at 17°, and though I repeated this at one minute's interval,
								three times, the mercury was still at the same degree. When I took
								it out, it fell in a second's time to 16°, and gradually lower. In
								my cabin on board the ship, it stood at 7°; having been carried
								close to my body up the hill, by a long ascent, it rose to 8°; I
								hung it therefore in the open air, in the shade of a tree on the
								hill, about twenty yards from the smoking place, for about five
								minutes, and found it to stand at 8°, and to remain at the same
								height for a long while after. When I was digging the hole for the
								reception of the thermometer, the natives seemed uneasy, and were
								apprehensive the place would be on fire.4 This happened on August
								the 12th at about ten o'clock in the morning.</p><p n="62">I went up again on August the 14th in the forenoon, and repeated the
								experiment with this difference only, that we entirely buried the
								thermometer in the hole, by putting loose earth round it. It had
								stood that day in my cabin at 7°, on the hill at 8°; but after
								having been buried a minute, it rose to 21° and there it remained
								stationary for five minutes. As I could trace the spiracula of hot
								steams, blended with some sulphureous smell, all along the side of
								the hill, down to the hot wells; it is probable, that a stream of
								water, in a subterraneous chasm or crevice, coming too near one of
								the places, that are violently heated by the neighbouring volcano,
								is resolved into steams; and forced through the earth and stones;
								parts of it however seem again to gather somewhere in small streams,
								oozing out at the hot wells, close to the sea-side. I am even apt to
								believe, that this chasm or crevice is connected with the crater of
								the volcano: for on August the 11th, when the volcano was heard
								making great explosions, and seen throwing up very large masses of
								stones, ignited ashes, and immense clouds of thick smoke, we
								observed on the hill, that at each explosion, there came new
								quantities of steam through the spiracula.</p><p n="63">At the bottom of the harbour near the beach, is a small pond
								containing some fresh and palatable water; it is tinged somewhat
								brownish and though perfectly good when fresh, it soon contracted in
								the casks a much greater degree of putrefaction and foetid smell,
								than had been observed of any other water during the while voyage,
								which I believe proves that some foreign, perhaps inflammable
								particles are contained in this water. This pond was connected,
								within the bushes, with a range of stagnant, muddy waters, for more
								than a mile or two, along the plain opposite the harbour. These
								waters, are it seems gathered here during the rainy season; and as
								they have no visible drain, they collect in the lowest parts and
								stagnate, and as the whole surface of the soil of the isle is formed
								of volcanic ashes, containing all more or less saline or sulphureous
								particles, the water may dissolve them, and strike the brown colour
								by extracting the vegetable substances gradually falling into or
								coming into contact with it.</p><p n="64">In the rest of the isles belonging to the New Hebrides, we frequently
								observed large streams of water forming cascades on the steep
								descents of hills, and thus precipitating themselves down and soon
								mixing with the briny fluid of the ocean.</p><p n="65">The Friendly Isles seem to be destitute of springs: for though on
								some of them, as Eaoowhe and Namocka, there are small hills and
								rising grounds, they are however far from being so high as to
								attract the clouds or to cause from their perpetual mositure a
								continual flow of spring-water. The natives have ponds, some of
								which are large, wherein they collect the rain-water: but it is
								somewhat brackish from the vicinity of the sea. Besides these ponds
								of fresh water, there is in Namocka a large lagoon of salt water
								about three miles long, full of small isles, beautifully ornamented
								with clusters of trees, crowded with wild ducks, and surrounded by
								bushes of mangroves and hills forming a romantic landscape.</p><p n="66">In Huaheine, one of the Society Isles, there are on its North point
								likewise two large salt water lagoons, with a very muddy bottom; as
								they are shallow, considerably within the land, surrounded by thick
								bushes and large trees, and therefore very little agitated by winds,
								they stink most immoderately, and must I suppose, spread noxious
								effluvia; and I must confess, I saw only a few habitations on its
								South side near the hills, and those were not quite contiguous to
								the lagoons.</p><p n="67">In Norfolk Island we found a small spring, and I believe if we had
								searched the whole isle over, we should have found more.</p><p n="68">Easter Island has no other water, but what is found in some
								reservoirs in forms of wells or ponds, collected I suppose from
								rain. It is stagnant, bad and somewhat brackish.</p><p n="69">The Marquesas have abundance of the finest springs, forming many
								beautiful streams and cascades: for their cloud capt hills, are
								constantly moistened from the vapour of the clouds, and therefore
								yield plentiful supplies for the springs in this hot climate.</p><p n="70">New-zeeland no doubt has abundance of springs and rivulets; and there
								is hardly an islet or rock, which is not blessed with a spring of
								fresh water. In Dusky Bay there are several rich springs; but all
								the water running and being drained through a rich, spungy, loose
								mould formed from putrefied vegetables, has acquired a deep brown
								colour; it is nevertheless free from foulness, has no peculiar taste
								and keeps at sea remarkably well.</p><p n="71">Tierra Del Fuego is richly provided with the finest springs and large
								ponds of fresh water, from the melted snow, on its high and barren
								rocks. In some places we observed large and high cascades, which
								greatly contribute to soften the harshness of its wild scenery.</p><p n="72">In South-georgia and Sandwich-land, we met with no springs: but as
								there is ice enough in its vicinity and even as far as the parallel
								of 5° South latitude, in their spring season, and in the depth of
								summer and autumn higher up in 6° and 7°, a navigator cannot be at a
								loss for fresh water in high Southern latitudes.</p><p n="73">If I except the water at Tanna in the hot wells, which perhaps may
								contain some saline particles on account of a faint astringency I
								tasted, we did not meet with any other medicated water whatsoever in
								the course of our expedition.</p></div><div type="chapter" n="7" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head><l>SECTION II</l><l>RIVULETS</l></head><p n="74">ALL the springs of the Society Isles, Marquesas, and New-Zeeland form
								rivulets; but none of them are so considerable as to deserve a
								particular notice. In Dusky Bay where all the inlets of the sea are
								very deep, we always found, that wherever the bottoms of bays or
								creeks have a stream of water coming down, the water gradually
								shoaled, so that at a good distance from the bottom of the bay, the
								boats ran a ground; which I think confirms the opinion, that these
								streams having by their impetuosity after a heavy rain or melting of
								snow from the sides of the steep hills, carried a great many earthy
								particles down to the very mouth of the rivulet, they deposit them
								there gradually: being, as I suppose, necessitated to this deposit
								by the resistance of the briny and therefore heavier fluid of the
								ocean, by the winds and tides meeting the stream, and other such
								causes.</p><p n="75">We observed, in the several inlets and arms forming this spacious
								bay, sometimes cascades rushing rapidly down, and falling from vast
								heights before they met with another rock. Some of these cascades
								with their neighbouring scenery, require the pencil and genius of a
								SALVATOR ROSA to do them justice: however the ingenious artist, who
								went with us on this expedition has great merit, in having executed
								some of these romantic landscapes in a masterly manner.</p><p n="76">The upper parts of all the rivulets in the Society Isles, are not so
								useless or neglected, as might be imagined. Wherever the natives
								observe that the valley between the steep sides enlarges, there they
								form a wear, by piling large stones so high, that the water is
								raised on a level with or even higher than the plain; which they
								surround with a small bank, make it level and plant it with eddoes1
								or arum esculentum, a plant which likes to be under water and thus
								grows into large tuberous roots; they then admit the water into
								these plantations from above the wear and discharge it at the
								opposite end. The wears serve the natives at the same time for a
								bridge, they being extremely skilful in jumping from one large stone
								to another, and sometimes carrying at the same time a burthen on
								their backs.</p></div><div type="chapter" n="8" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head><l>SECTION III</l><l>OCEAN</l></head><p n="77">THE last and most considerable body of water is the ocean. It highly
								deserves to be examined on many accounts, and though the remarks we
								have to make on it are but few and perhaps trivial, we will venture
								to communicate them, as they may serve to confirm some known
								positions.</p><div type="subsection"><head>The Depth of the Ocean</head><p n="78">The Depth of the ocean is certainly one of the most remarkable
									circumstances. We now and then even out of sight of any land,
									tried to measure this depth; for instance in the year 1772 Sept.
									5th. being near the line in 0° 52 North latitude, we could find
									no ground with 250 fathom. On February 8th. 1773, when we were
									in something more than 4° South latitude, a little to the East
									of the meridian of the isle of Mauritius, we had 210 fathom line
									out, but found no ground. On November the 22nd. 1774 being in
									the middle of the Pacific Ocean, we sounded with 150 fathom and
									found no ground.</p><p n="79">It has been laid down as a maxim by the learned and ingenious
									Count de Buffon*<ref target="#jf14"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf14">* Historie Naturelle tom. 2d p. 199 &amp;amp; 200. edit. in 12 mo.1</note></ref> "that the depth of the sea along the coasts is
									commonly so much greater as these coasts are more elevated, and
									again so much less as they are lower, and that the inequality of
									the bottom of the sea generally corresponds with the inequality
									of the surface of the soil of the coast" and Dampier is quoted
									in confirmation of this assertion. Though the learned author
									certainly merits the applause of the world, it has however been
									the fate of his work to have the common stamp of all human
									productions; viz. to have some imperfections, and even to
									recount some false assertions upon the faith of other authors
									and travellers: the illustrious author, is so well-known for his
									love of truth, and for the variety of his erudition, that he
									will no doubt find it just to give his work all that perfection,
									which it is capable of, by correcting whatsoever is not strictly
									conformable to truth and nature. I will therefore, on the
									strength of his supposition and the encouragement personally
									given me by himself,2 remark that his observation will hold in
									regard to large lands; it is however equally true, that in
									regard to all the low isles in the South seas, and even in
									regard to the low reefs surrounding the Society Isles, this rule
									admits of many exceptions. In New Zeeland, Tierra del Fuego, New
									Caledonia and all the New Hebrides, I believe the rule to be
									true: for all these lands are high and have generally bold
									coasts; and the soundings are deep close into the shore without
									decreasing. I have however in some instances observed just the
									contrary; as off the South entrance of Dusky Bay we had about 45
									fathoms water; but in the bay itself we had no ground with 80
									fathom line. Off the South coast of Tierra del Fuego between
									Cape Noir and Christmas Bay, we had 45 and 50 fathom water,
									which increased to 60 or 70; but when we stood in for Christmas
									Bay we had no ground with 80 fathom of line, in the very
									entrance. When we were off the coast of South Georgia we had
									regular soundings, but in the entrance of Possession Bay we had
									no ground with 54 fathoms. According to the above rule of Mr. de
									Buffon, the low isles in the South-Seas should have gradual
									soundings; but we found the contrary to be true: for close to
									the reef forming these isles, the water is almost unfathomable.
									The same may be said of O-Taheitee and all the Society Isles,
									which are surrounded by a fertile plain extending from the hills
									to the sea, and then included in a reef, beyond which the sea
									immediately becomes excessively deep. Near Turtle-Island we saw
									an oblong reef, which was no where free from water, had a deep
									sea included, and on its outsides there was a great depth close
									to the reef. All these instances here enumerated, seem to be
									exceptions to Mr. de Buffon's rule.</p></div><div type="subsection"><head>The Colour of the Ocean</head><p n="80">wherever there is an extensive bank or shoal, there the colour of
									the sea-water is changed; but even this is subject to many
									exceptions: sometimes we find places which are amazingly clear,
									and the ground, at the depth of several fathoms, may be seen as
									plainly as if it were within a few yards of the surface;
									sometimes the sea assumes a grey hue, and seems turbid, as if it
									had lost its limpidity. But often you are deceived by the
									situation of the sky and clouds. Dark, cloudy weather involves
									likewise the whole ocean in a grey hue. A serene and clear sky
									tinges the waves with the finest berylline or blueish-green
									colour. If a cloud appears, it gives to a spot of the sea a hue
									quite different from the rest; and, if not well attended to,
									often alarms the navigator with the fear of soundings, or even
									shoals. A judicious eye, conducted by long experience, can alone
									distinguish properly in these cases. But, upon the whole, it
									cannot be too much recommended to navigators, especially in
									unexplored seas, to make use of the lead in every doubtful
									situation.*<ref target="#jf15"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf15">* See Mr. Dalrymple's Memoir of a Chart of the Southern Ocean, p.7.</note></ref></p></div><div type="subsection"><head>Of the Saltness of the Ocean</head><p n="81">It has been suspected, that the saltness of the ocean is not
									every where equal. Some assert the sea to be salter under the
									Line than towards the Poles;=<ref target="#jf16"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf16">= Buffon's Histoire Naturelle, tom. 2. p. 79. edit. in 12 mo.</note></ref> that the great oceans are salter
									than the smaller seas, which are almost included by land, viz.
									the Baltic, the Mediterranean, the White Sea near Archangel, the
									Persian and the Arabic Gulphs, etc.; that its saltness increases
									with its large depth; and lastly, that the high sea, at a great
									distance from land, is salter than near it, and especially near
									places where large rivers fall into the sea. I had no
									opportunity to make the necessary experiments to ascertain or to
									refute these assertions, as I was obliged to set out upon this
									expedition almost at a moment's warning, and could not therefore
									provide any apparatus necessary for that purpose. The above
									remarks may, however, serve to future navigators, as a hint of
									what is still wanted to be observed, relative to the saltness of
									the ocean. I should therefore propose to them, to procure the
									apparatus described by Mr. Wilke, in the Memoirs of the Swedish
									Academy, vol. 33, n. 6 of the 1st quarter, which serves to bring
									the water of the ocean up from any given depth: they ought also
									to be provided with an accurate and nice hydrostatical balance,
									in order to ascertain the specific gravity of any water or
									liquid; or they may make use, for convenience sake, of a
									haloscopium, consisting of a hollow globe of ivory, into which a
									tube of about five or six inches must be inserted, on which the
									different specific weights of pure water, and its various
									mixtures with certain quantities of common salt, are marked in
									degrees; so that, by immersing this simple machine into
									sea-water, it would be easy to ascertain the degrees of its
									saltness. This machine would likewise serve to ascertain the
									comparative purity and weight of every water found in rivers,
									wells, etc. etc.</p><p n="82">It has likewise formerly been believed, that, besides the common
									saltness, the water of the ocean contained particles, which
									communicated to it a kind of bitterness, that made it next to
									impossible to distil drinkable water from sea-water. The
									ingenious Dr. Lind,3 of Haslar-hospital, near Portsmouth, has
									long ago shewn how little foundation there is in this prejudice,
									and likewise taught the British nation, without any public
									reward or encouragement, an easy and approved method for
									obtaining, by distillation, potable water from sea-water.*<ref target="#jf17"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf17">* Lind's Essay on Diseases incidental to Europeans in hot climates. Appendix, p. 351.</note></ref> When
									we made use of Dr. Irving's distilling machine, we likewise
									found, that the water thus distilled was not only entirely freed
									from its salt, but, besides this, we never could discover the
									least bitter particle in the drinkable water. But it must not by
									any means be concluded from hence, that there are no such bitter
									particles contained in the sea-water, for everyone knows too
									well, that, after the fresh water has been evaporated from
									sea-water, and salt has been thereby formed, there remains
									always a thick, gelatinous lie, which cannot be crystallized,
									and which is nothing but a mixture, containing marine acid and
									magnesia alba, and, besides these ingredients, the sea-brine
									always contains some Glauber's salt and some selenitic
									particles; so that it seems as if the whole were a mixture of
									fresh water, marine acid, vitriolic acid, fixed mineral alkali,
									magnesia, and lime. However, though several of these substances
									form a bitter salt by their mixture, they nevertheless will not
									hinder the sea-water from affording a clear, limpid, potable
									water by distillation, because the particles being all fixed,
									remain in the salt-brine, which is left in the copper; and the
									water being alone volatile, rises in steams, and is distilled.
									Or even if, by distillation, a few acid or saline particles
									should be volatilized, and mix with the distilled water, their
									proportion is certainly so small and insignificant, that no
									detriment can be derived from thence. On the usefulness and
									practicability of the method of distilling water, I can say
									nothing, as it is not my province, and as a report has been made
									to the Admiralty by persons, whose proper business it was.</p></div><div type="subsection"><head>The Warmth or Temperature of the Ocean</head><p n="83">To ascertain the degree of warmth of the sea-water, at a certain
									depth, several experiments were made by us. The thermometer made
									use of, is of Fahrenheit's construction, made by Mr. Ramsden,
									and furnished with an ivory scale: it was, on these occasions,
									always put into a cylindrical tin case, which had at each end a
									valve, admitting the water as long as the instrument was going
									down, and shutting while it was hawling up again. The annexed
									table will at once show the result of the experiments.</p><p n="84">[INSERT TABLE FROM PAGE 60 OF ORIGINAL]</p><p n="85">From this table it appears, that under the Line, and near the
									Tropics, the water is cooler at a great depth than at its
									surface. In high latitudes, the air is colder sometimes,
									sometimes very near upon a par, and sometimes warmer than the
									sea-water at the depth of about 100 fathoms; according as the
									preceding changes of the temperature of the air, or the
									direction and violence of the wind happen to fall out. For it is
									to be observed, that these experiments were always made when we
									had a calm, or at least very little wind; because, in a gale of
									wind, we could not have been able to make them in a boat.
									Another probable cause of the difference in the temperature of
									the sea-water, in the same high latitude, undoubtedly must be
									sought in the ice; in a sea covered with high and extensive ice
									islands, the water should be colder than in a sea which is at a
									great distance from any ice.</p></div><div type="subsection"><head>The Phosphoreal Light of the Sea-Water</head><p n="86">It is very well known, that the sea-water has sometimes a
									luminous appearance, or, to use a more philosophical word, a
									phosphorical light. Many have endeavoured to give us the real
									causes of this phaenomenon;*<ref target="#jf18"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf18">* The Father Bourzes, in the Lettres Edifiantes, tom. ix. Par. 1730 speaks of the phosphoreal light of the sea with judgment; and still more so, the late ingenious philosopher, Mr. Canton, Phil. Trans. vol. ix.
										p. 446, in his paper on the luminous appearance of the sea.</note></ref> and, in consequence, some have
									brought us the drawing of a curious submarine insect, related to
									the shrimp kind, which had a peculiar luminous appearance, and
									asserted this to be the cause of the phosphoreal light of the
									sea.=<ref target="#jf19"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf19">= See the Gentleman's Magazine, for 1771; and Basteri Opusc. subsec. Tom. I. P. I. p. 31. Tab. iv. fig.</note></ref> Others again ascribe it to the great number of animals of
									the mollusca-tribe, swimming every where in the sea. The
									above-mentioned shrimps, as well as the mollusca, may contribute
									to make the sea appear luminous; but I would not venture to
									assert these to be the only causes of the phosphoreal light,
									after the observation of the various phaenomena I made in the
									course of this long voyage.</p><p n="87">First, I found reason to doubt, whether all the luminous
									appearances in the sea are of the same nature; for one kind of
									these phaenomena never extend to a great distance from the ship;
									that part of the sea only appears luminous which is close to the
									ship, and the light is likewise communicated only to the top of
									the next waves, that break obliquely from it; and this happens
									commonly in a fresh gale.</p><p n="88">Another kind of phosphoreal light I observed commonly in, or
									immediately succeeding a long calm, after hot weather; it spread
									more over, and even mixed with the body of the sea, than the
									former. When we took the sea-water in this condition into a tub,
									it there became dark as soon as it was free from motion: but, at
									each violent agitation of the water, it appeared luminous, where
									the motion was produced, and seemed to stick for a moment only
									to the finger or hand, which agitated the water, but disappeared
									as instantaneously.</p><p n="89">The third kind of phosphoreal light is no doubt caused by
									mollusca,*<ref target="#jf20"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf20">* The genus of Sepia or cuttle-fish, and that of Medusa or blubber, shine in the water in the dark. See among others Linn‚. Syst. Nat. ed. xii. p. 1095. Also, Hawkesworth's Compilation of Voyages, vol. ii.

									them. But the most singular and surprizing appearance of this
									nature, I observed in the night preceding Oct. 30, 1772, when we
									were off the Cape of Good Hope, at the distance of a few miles
									from the shore, and had a fresh gale. Scarcely had night spread
									its veil over the surface of the ocean, when it had the
									apperance of being all over on fire. Every wave that broke had a
									luminous margin or top; wherever the sides of the ship came in
									contact with the sea, there appeared a line of phosphoreal
									light. The eye discovered this luminous appearance every where
									on the ocean; nay, the very bosom of this immense element seemed
									to be pregnant with this shining appearance. We saw great bodies
									illuminated moving in the sea; some came along-side of the ship,
									and stood on along with her; others moved off from her with a
									velocity almost equal to lightning. The shape of these
									illuminated bodies discovered them to be fishes. Some approached
									near one another, and when a small one came near a larger, it
									made all possible haste to fly from the danger. I had a bucket
									full of this luminous sea-water drawn up for examination. We
									found, that an infinite number of little round luminous bodies
									were moving in the water with amazing quickness. After the water
									had been standing for a little while, the small sparkling
									objects seemed to decrease in quantity, but, by stirring the
									water again, we observed the whole to be again entirely
									luminous; and leaving the water undisturbed, we saw the little
									sparks moving very briskly in different directions. Though the
									bucket with the water was suspended, that it might be less
									affected by the motion of the ship, the sparkling objects still
									moved to and fro', so that this first convinced me, that these
									luminous atoms had a voluntary motion, quite independent of the
									agitation of the water or ship; but, at each agitation of the
									water by a stick or the hand, we plainly perceived the sparkling
									to increase. Sometimes, by stirring the water, one of these
									phosphoreal sparks would stick to the hand or finger. They were
									scarcely of the size of the smallest pin's head. The least
									magnifier of my microscope discovered these little atoms to be
									globular, gelatinous, transparent, and somewhat brownish. By
									putting one under the microscope, we observed first a kind of
									thin tube going into the substance of this little globule, from
									a round orifice on its surface. The inside was filled with four
									or five oblong intestine bags, connected with the tube just
									mentioned. The same appearances were observed by the greatest
									magnifier, and were only more distinct. I wanted to examine one
									in the water, and then bring it under the microscope, but I
									could not provide a live animalcule: they were all dead, on
									account of their tender structure, before I could separate them
									from the finger to which they were flicking. This attempt was
									accordingly frustrated. When we left the Cape of Good Hope, on
									November the 22d, we had that very night the same luminous
									appearance of the sea, and a very hard gale. Thus we have again
									a new cause of the phosphoreal light. But, before we proceed
									with our remarks, let us only follow the idea arising from this
									phaenomenon. The immense ocean, filled with myriads of
									animalcules, which have life, loco-motion, and a power of
									shining in the dark, of laying that power aside at pleasure, and
									illuminating all bodies coming in contact with them; this is a
									wonder which fills the mind with greater astonishment and
									reverential awe, than it is in my power justly and properly to
									describe.</p><p n="90">If I were now to say something on the different species of
									phosphoreal light, I could by no means give my assertion, that
									degree of certainty with philosophers would require. I will
									therefore confine myself to some probable hints concerning their
									real causes.</p><p n="91">The first species of luminous appearance seems to be produced by
									a cause altogether different from the rest, and if I may venture
									to declare my opinion on the subject, I should think, that this
									light is owing to electricity. We know very well, that the
									motion of a ship through the water in a gale, is extremely
									swift, and the friction caused by this motion very great: for we
									find that the sea agitated by a gale of wind is remarkably
									warmer, than the air.*<ref target="#jf23"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf23">* See a voyage towards the North Pole, by Capt. Phipps. Appendix. p. 147.</note></ref> The bituminous substances, which cover
									the sides of ships, the nails sticking in the bottom, and the
									conducting power of water will equally serve to explain the
									possibility of such an electricity.</p><p n="92">The second species of luminous appearance in sea water seems to
									be a real phosphoreal light. It is very well known, that many
									animal bodies putrify and are dissolved in the sea, and that
									almost every part of animal and many mineral bodies, and the air
									itself, contains the acid of phosphorus as an integrant part.=<ref target="#jf24"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf24">= See Elemens de Mineralogie docimastique par M. Sage, Paris 1777, 8vo. Preface p. xi. vol. II. p. 376, 377, 378.</note></ref>
									The addition of any inflammable principle to this acid, will
									produce the substance we call phosphorus. Every one who has seen
									salted fish drying, must know that many of them become
									phosphoreal. It is likewise a well established fact, that the
									ocean, itself after a long continued calm, becomes stinking and
									highly putrid,×<ref target="#jf25"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf25">× See Boyle. T. III. p. 222,5 he relates that some navigators, in a calm which lasted thirteen days, found the sea becoming putrid.</note></ref> arising probably from the putrefaction of a
									great many animal substances, that die in the ocean, float in
									it, and in hot calm days frequently and suddenly putrefy. That
									fishes and mollusca contain oily and inflammable particles is
									equally well known. The acid of phosphorus disengaged by
									putrefaction from its original mixture in animal bodies, may
									easily combine with some of the just mentioned inflammables, and
									thus produce a phosphorus floating on the top of the ocean, and
									causing that luminous appearance, which we so much admire.</p><p n="93">Lastly the third kind of phosphoreal light no doubt arises from
									live animals floating in the sea and is owing to their peculiar
									structure or rather the nature of their integrant parts, which
									perhaps might be investigated, by analyzing chemically some of
									the mollusca, which have a luminous appearance.</p></div><div type="subsection"><head>On the Question concerning the Existence of a Southern

									argument, that in case there should be no more land in the
									Southern hemisphere, than what we knew before, it would be
									insufficient to counterpoise the weight of lands in the
									Northern. An ingenious author, whose disinterested zeal for the
									promotion of geography, navigation and discoveries is not less

									friend, has lately=<ref target="#jf27"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf27">= Dalrymple's collection of voyages to the South-Sea, vol. p.</note></ref> endeavoured to set these arguments in a
									stronger light. Our present circumnavigation has, I believe, put
									it beyond doubt, that there is no land on this side of 6° in the
									Southern hemisphere, if we except the few inconsiderable
									fragments we found in the Southern atlantic ocean. If therefore
									we should even suppose, that the whole space from 6° and
									upwards, where we have not been, be intirely occupied by land,
									this would be still too inconsiderable to counterpoise the lands
									of the Northern hemisphere. I am therefore apt to suspect, that
									nature has provided against this defect, by placing perhaps at
									the bottom of the Southern ocean such bodies as by their
									specific weight will compensate the deficiency of lands; if this
									system of the wanted counterpoise be at all necessary. But there
									may perhaps be other methods to obviate this defect, of which
									our narrow knowledge and experience have not yet informed
									us.</p></div></div><div type="chapter" n="9" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head><l>SECTION IV</l><l>ICE AND ITS FORMATION</l></head><p n="95">NOTHING appeared more strange to the several navigators in high
								latitudes, than the first sight of the immense masses of ice which
								are found floating in the ocean; and I must confess, that though I
								had read a great many accounts on their nature, figure, formation
								and magnitude, I was however very much struck by their first
								appearance. The real grandeur of the sight by far surpassed any
								thing I could expect; for we saw sometimes islands of ice of one or
								two miles extent, and at the same time a hundred feet or upwards
								above water. We will suppose, that ice of parallel dimensions
								swimming in sea-water, only shews one part out of ten above water;=<ref target="#jf28"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf28">= Boyle Philos. Trans. No 62.2</note></ref>
								which is a moderate supposition, because according to Mairan×<ref target="#jf29"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf29">× Mairan sur la glace p. 264.</note></ref> ice
								swimming in fresh water had one fourteenth part of the whole above
								its surface; nay, Dr. IrvingQ<ref target="#jf30"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf30">Q A voyage towards the North Pole by Capt. Phipps. Appendix. p. 147.</note></ref> plunged a piece of the most solid ice
								in melted snow water and fourteen fifteenth parts sunk under its
								level. A piece therefore of only one mile in length, a quarter of a
								mile in breadth, and 100 feet above water contains 696,960,000 cubic
								feet of solid ice; but as the 100 feet, are only the contents of the
								ice above water, the same must be taken nine times more for the
								contents under water; and the whole will then amount to
								6,969,600,000 cubic feet of solid ice, which must of course be a
								stupendous mass. But the enormous size of these icy masses is not
								the only object of our astonishment, for the great number of them is
								equally surprizing. In the year, 1773 on the 26th, of December, we
								counted 186 masses of ice all in sight from the mast head, whereof
								none was less than the hull of a ship. At other times we were every
								where surrounded by ice islands, or obliged to alter our course,
								because it was obstructed by an immense field of ice. On these
								occasions we saw first small pieces of loose, broken ice, full of
								holes and pores like a spunge, thus wafted by the continual
								agitation of the waves; behind them appeared large flat and solid
								masses, of an immense extent. Between them we observed stupendous
								large and high ice islands, likewise solid but formed in the most
								strange manner into points, spires and broken rocks. All this scene
								of ice extended as far as the eye could reach. However, it is
								likewise remarkable, that in different years, seasons and places of
								the sea, we found the ice differently situated. In the year 1772,
								December the 10th, we saw the ice between 5° and 5° of Southern
								latitude. In 1773 on December the 12th, we found the first ice in 6°
								South latitude. In 1775, in January the 27th, we saw ice in about 6°
								South latitude. On February the 24th, we came to the same place,
								where about 26 months before, we had met with such an impenetrable
								body of ice, as had obliged us to run to the East; but where at this
								last time no vestige of it appeared no more than at the place, where
								BOUVET3 had placed his Cape Circumcision, we having sailed over the
								whole tract, which he suspected to be land; nor could we be mistaken
								in its situation, as we had been on the same parallel for a
								considerable time: so that it is impossible to have missed the land,
								if any had existed, as we had frequent opportunities to ascertain
								our latitude.</p><p n="96">Another circumstance worthy of notice is, that all ice floating in
								the sea yields fresh water when melted. However care must be taken
								never to collect such ice which is spungy and honeycombed from the
								agitation of the waves, as this kind of ice always contained
								considerable quantity of brine in the interstices and spungy
								cavities which does not entirely drain from it by suffering it to
								lie on the deck of the ship, and therefore is less fit for yielding
								good potable water. This kind of ice may well be distinguished from
								the more solid forts both by its appearance and by its situation, as
								it commonly is the outermost at the approach of any large quantity
								of ice, and therefore more exposed to the agitation of the waves. To
								leeward of large ice masses, commonly loose pieces of ice are
								drifting of various sizes; those that are nearest the large mass,
								are commonly the most solid, and therefore the most proper for
								supplying the ship with water. Of this ice, such pieces are taken up
								as can be conveniently lifted into the boat; and then they are piled
								up on the quarter-deck, where the salt-water, adhering to its
								outside, soon drains away; and, as the contact of the deck and
								warmer atmosphere contributes to dissolve some part of the ice, the
								rest becomes quite fresh. With this ice the boiler is filled, that
								it may the more readily be dissolved. Other ice is broken into such
								pieces as will go through the bung-holes into the water-casks; and
								when there is not room for more, the interstices are filled up, with
								the water from the boiler, which soon melts the small pieces of ice
								in the cask.</p><p n="97">When we came to leeward of extensive portions of small drifting ice,
								or such as the Greenlandmen call packed, i.e. on the edges of which,
								by the sea and pressure of the ice, small pieces are forced up, we
								always found the sea smooth; and this was the appearance, when we
								entered the loose ice on January the 17th, 1773, in 6° 15' South
								latitude; but, on the weather-side of the ice, there was a great
								swell and high surf. Whenever we approached large tracts of solid
								ice, we observed, on the horizon, a white reflexion from the snow
								and ice, which the Greenlandmen call the blink of the ice: so that
								seeing this phaenomenon appear, we were sure to be within a few
								leagues of the ice; and it was at that time likewise, that we
								commonly noticed flights of white petrels of the size of pigeons,
								which we called snowy petrels, the common fore-runners of the
								ice.</p><p n="98">It has been observed, that the large masses of ice floating in the
								ocean, cool the air considerably; so that, upon approaching them,
								the change may be sensibly felt.</p><p n="99">On the 11th of December, 1772, on a clear mild day, before we reached
								a large mass of ice, of about half a mile in length, and a hundred
								feet high, the thermometer on deck, fixed on the capstan, was at 4°.
								When we were to leeward of it, the thermometer sunk to 37°; and when
								we had passed it, which was at about five o'clock in the afternoon,
								it had risen again to 4°. On December the 13th, 1772, in the morning
								early, the thermometer was at about 3°, and it had continued to snow
								all the night and morning. In the morning, between seven and eight
								o'clock, we approached a great many ice-islands, some of which were
								of vast extent. At eight o'clock the thermometer pointed at 31°; it
								remained there when we were just to leeward of the largest of them;
								and, after we had passed it, the thermometer did not rise higher
								than 31°. I believe the cold was not lessened, because the deck
								being wet from the snow, caused a great evaporation, which cooled
								the air: and we were likewise every where surrounded by large
								ice-masses, which had so much cooled the atmosphere all round, that
								it remained in the same temperature. Both these instances seem
								therefore to prove, that the ice-masses contribute considerably
								towards cooling the atmosphere.</p><p n="100">The ice floats in an ocean, which in the summer of the Southern
								hemisphere was observed to be many degrees above the freezing point;
								it must therefore continually melt and decay; and, as the difference
								of the specific gravity of common air to fresh water is nearly as
								0.001 or 0.000 to 1.000; supposing both of the same temperature; it
								is evident that fresh water must melt the ice, more than common air,
								as the particles of water in contact with the ice are so much
								heavier; and, for the same reason as sea-water is to fresh water as
								1.030 to 1.000, sea-water must act still more upon the ice than
								fresh-water.*<ref target="#jf31"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf31">* However large masses of ice require a long time and a warm climate entirely to dissolve them. Sometimes in 40° North latitude, ice-islands have been met with in the Atlantic: and I have been told by an officer, who spent several years at and about Newfoundland, that a very bulky ice-island was driven into the Streights of Belleisle, where it was grounded, and continued a whole summer, and was not entirely dissolved before the summer of the next year.</note></ref> We had frequent opportunities of seeing the effect of
								the sea-water upon the ice, in dissolving and crumbling large masses
								to pieces, with a crash not inferior to the explosion of guns; and
								sometimes we were at so small a distance from them, that we were
								scarce out of the reach of the danger of being crushed by an
								ice-rock splitting in pieces, which were oversetting, each of them
								having gotten new centers of gravity. The water melted from the ice,
								and mixed with the ocean, must likewise cool the temperature of the
								sea-water in the latitudes between 50 and 6° South, where these
								particulars were chiefly observed by us.</p><p n="101">It seems to be undeniable, that the ice we met with in the open
								ocean, in 5° and 6°, or even 7° South latitude, is formed still
								farther to the South. For it had its origin either near some land,
								or in the open ocean. In the first case it must evidently come from
								regions lying beyond the tracks of our ships, i.e. beyond 6°, 6°,
								and 7° South latitude, as we found no lands, where these enormous
								quantities of ice could possibly have been generated. Or, in the
								second case, if the ice be formed far from any land, this climate
								must likewise be farther to the South than our tracks, as we never
								fell in with ice, which we would with certainty consider as
								stationary, but, on the contrary, found it commonly in motion. At
								least, the loose ice between 7° and 5° South latitude, must have
								come from the fast, solid ice beyond 7° or some higher latitude.
								Other navigators,*<ref target="#jf32"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf32">* Dalrymple's Collection of Voyages, chiefly in the Southern Atlantic Ocean. Capt. Halley's Journal,
									p. 34, and Capt. Bouvet's, p. 4.</note></ref> as well as ourselves, have met with ice in low
								Southern latitudes, i.e. 4°, 5°, 5°, and 5°, early in spring and
								summer; consequently it is evident, that it must have drifted to
								these low latitudes from beyond 6°, 6°, and 7° South latitude. In
								the Northern seas, it is a common and obvious phaenomenon, observed
								almost every year, that the ice moves towards warmer climates. These
								instances, therefore, seem to prove, that there is either a strong
								current, an attraction, or some other cause acting regularly, which
								carries these large masses of ice from each pole towards the
								equinoctial line.</p><p n="102">I should here finish these remarks on the ice, if it were not
								necessary to say something concerning its formation. I know that Mr.
								de Buffon,Q<ref target="#jf33"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf33">Q De Buffon Histoire Naturelle, edit. in 12mo. tom.

								found in the ocean, is formed near lands, only from the fresh water
								and ice carried down into the sea by the many rivers in Sibiria,
								Hudson's Bay, &amp;c. and therefore when we fell in with such
								quantities of ice in December, 1772, I expected we should soon meet
								with the land, from whence these ice masses had been detached. But
								being disapppointed in the discovery of this land, though we
								penetrated beyond the 6° twice, and once beyond 7° South latitude,
								and having besides some other doubts concerning the existence of the
								pretended Southern Continent, I thought it necessary to enquire,
								what reasons chiefly induced the above authors to form the opinion
								that the ice floating in the ocean, must be formed near land, or
								that an Austral land is absolutely requisite for that purpose,F<ref target="#jf36"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf36">F Buffon Hist. Naturelle, tom. 1, p. 314. speaks of the Austral Lands as necessary for the formation of the ice, &amp;amp; tom. 2. p. 99.</note></ref> and
								having looked for their arguments, I find they amount chiefly to
								this; "that the ice floating in the ocean is all fresh, that salt
								water does not freeze at all, or if it does, it contains briny
								particles; they infer from thence, that the ice in the ocean cannot
								be formed in the sea, far from any land; there must therefore exist
								Austral lands; because in order to form an idea of the origin of the
								great ice masses agreeably to what is observed in the Northern
								hemisphere, they find that the first (point d ppui) point for fixing
								the high ice islands is the land, and secondly that the great
								quantity of flat ice is brought down the rivers." I have impartially
								and carefully considered and examined these arguments, and compared
								every circumstance with what we saw in the high Southern latitudes,
								and with other known facts, and will here insert the result of all
								my enquiries on this subject.</p><p n="103">First, they observe the ice floating in the ocean to yield by
								melting, fresh water: which I believe to be true; however hitherto
								it has by no means been generally allowed to be fresh, for Crantz=<ref target="#jf37"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf37">= Crantz's Hist. of Greenland, p. 31.</note></ref>
								says expressly, that, "the flat pieces (forming what they call the
								Ice-Fields) are salt, because they were congealed from sea water."
								The ice taken up by us for watering the ship was of all kinds, and
								nevertheless we found it constantly fresh, which proves, either that
								the principle of analogy cannot be applied indiscriminately in both
								hemispheres, and that on thing may be true in the Northern
								hemisphere, which is quite otherwise in the Southern, from reasons
								not yet known or discovered by us: or we must think that Crantz and
								others are mistaken, who suppose the ice floating in the ocean to be
								salt.</p><p n="104">The next remark is, that salt water does not freeze at all, or if it
								does it contains briny particles. Mr. de Buffon,*<ref target="#jf38"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf38">* Ibid vol. I. p. 318.</note></ref> the most ingenious
								and the most elegant writer of Natural History, tells us, "that the
								sea between Nova Zemla and Spitzbergen under the 7° North latitude
								does not freeze, as it is there considerably broad, and that it is
								not to be apprehended to find this sea frozen not even under the
								pole itself, for indeed there is no example of having ever found a
								sea wholly frozen over, and at a considerable distance from the
								shores; that the only instance of a sea entirely frozen is that of
								the Black Sea, which is narrow and not very salt, and receiving a
								great many rivers coming from Northern regions, and bringing down
								ice; that this sea therefore sometimes freezes to such a degree,
								that its whole surface is congealed, to a considerable thickness;
								and, if the historians are to be credited, was frozen in the reign
								of Emperor Constantine Copronymus thirty ells thick, not including
								twenty ells of snow, which was lying on the ice. This fact,
								continues M. de Buffon, seems to be exaggerated, but it is true
								however, that it freezes almost every winter, whilst the high seas
								which are 1000 leagues nearer, towards the pole do not freeze, which
								can have no other cause than the difference in saltness and the
								little quantity of ice carried out by rivers, if compared to the
								enormous quantity of ice which the rivers convey into the Black
								Sea." Mr. de Buffon is not mistaken when he mentions that the Black
								Sea frequently freezes. Strabo*<ref target="#jf39"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf39">* Strabo. Geogr. Lib. vii. p. m. 212.4</note></ref> informs us, that the people near the
								Bosporus Cimmerius pass this sea in carts from Panticapaeum to
								Phanagorea, and that Neoptolemus, a General of Mithridates Eupator,
								won a battle with his cavalry on the ice, on the very spot where he
								gained a naval victory in the summer. Marcellinus Comes=<ref target="#jf40"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf40">= Marcellinus Comes in Scaligeri edit. Euseb. p. 37.</note></ref> relates,

								in the year 1620/21 there happened so intense a frost that the
								people walked over the ice from Constantinople to Iskodar. All these
								instances confirm Mr. de Buffon's assertion; but as this great

								prodigious mountains. He climbed up to the top of some of these ice
								mountains, but seeing from thence no land, nor any thing except ice,
								as far as the eye could reach, and having besides no more food for
								this dogs left, he thought it very necessary to return, which he
								with great difficulty performed, on April the 3rd, as several of the
								dogs which had perished for want, were employed to support those
								that remained alive. These facts, I believe, will convince the
								unprejudiced reader, that there are other seas besides the Black
								Sea, which really do freeze in winter, and that the ice carried down
								the rivers, could not at least freeze the German Ocean between
								Norway and Denmark, because the rivers there are so small, and bear
								a very inconsiderable proportion to the immense ocean, which
								according to experiments made by Mr. Wilke*<ref target="#jf48"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf48">* Memoirs of the Swedish Academy, vol. 33. p. 66.</note></ref> is very salt, though
								near the land, in the Swedish harbour of Landscrona.</p><p n="105">Now, if six or seven degrees of latitude, containing from 360 to 420
								sea miles, are not to be reckoned a great distance from the land, I
								do not know in what manner to argue, because no distance whatsoever
								will be reckoned far from any land. Nay, if the Cossack Markoff,
								being mounted on one of the highest ice-mountains, may be allowed to
								see at least to the distance of 20 leagues, the extent alluded to
								above, must then be increased to 480 English sea-miles; which
								certainly is very considerable, and makes it more than probably,
								that the ocean is frozen in winter, in high Northern latitudes, even
								as far as the Pole. Besides, it invalidates the argument, which
								these gentlemen wish to infer from thence, that the ocean does not
								freeze in high latitudes, especially where there is a considerably
								broad sea: for we have shewn instances to the contrary.</p><p n="106">But M. de Buffon speaks of ice carried down the rivers into the
								Northern ocean, and forming there these immense quantities of ice;
								"and in case, says he,=<ref target="#jf49"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf49">= Buffon Hist. Nat. tom. i. p. 313.</note></ref> we would suppose, against all probability,
								that at the Pole it could be so cold as to congeal the surface of
								the sea, it would remain equally incomprehensible, how these
								enormous floating ice-masses could be formed, if they had not land
								for a point to fix on, and from whence they are severed by the heat
								of the sun. The two ships, which the India Company sent in 1739,
								upon the discovery of the Austral lands, found ice in 47 or 4° South
								latitude, but at no great distance from land; which they discovered,
								without being able to approach it. This ice, therefore, must have
								come from the interior parts of the lands near the South Pole, and
								we must conjecture, that it follows the course of several large
								rivers, washing these unknown lands, in the same manner as the
								rivers Oby, the Yenisea, and the other great rivers which fall into
								the Northern sea, carry the ice-masses, which stop up the streights
								of Waigats for the greater part of the year, and render the
								Tartarean sea inaccessible upon this course." Before we can allow
								the analogy between the rivers Oby, Yenisea, and the rest which sail
								into the Northern ocean, and those coming from the interior parts of
								the Austral lands, let us compare the situation of both countries,
								supposing the Austral lands really to exist. The Oby, Yenisea, and
								the rest of the Sibirian rivers, falling down into the Northern
								ocean, have their sources in 4° and 5° North latitude, where the
								climate is mild and capable of producing corn of all kinds. All the
								rivers of this great continent increasing these great rivers, have
								likewise their sources in mild and temperate climates, and the main
								direction of their course is from South to North; and the coast of
								the Northern ocean, not reckoning its sinuosities, runs in general
								West and East. The small rivers, which are formed in high latitudes,
								have, properly speaking, no sources, no springs, but carry off only
								the waters generated by the melting of snow in spring, and by the
								fall of rain in the short summer, and are for the greatest part dry
								in autumn. And the reason of this phaenomenon is obvious, after
								considering the constitution of the earth in those high Northern
								climates. At Yakut¡k, in about 6° North latitude, the soil is
								eternally frozen, even in the height of summer, at the depth of
								three feet from the surface. In the years 1685 and 1686, an attempt
								was made to dig a well; and a man, by great and indefatigable
								labour, continued during two summer-seasons, succeeded so far in
								this laborious task, that he at last reached the depth of 91 feet;
								but the whole earth at this depth was frozen, and he met with no
								water, which forced him to desist from so fruitless an attempt.*<ref target="#jf50"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf50">* Gmelin's Voyage to Sibiria, vol. 2. p. 520-523.</note></ref> And
								it is easy to infer from hence, how impossible it is, that springs
								should be formed in the womb of an eternally frozen soil. But let us
								now compare with this, the situation of the pretended unknown
								Austral lands. The coast of this land must be to the South of our
								navigation, in 6°, 6°, and 7° South latitude; and its direction we
								will allow to be East and West; the course, therefore, of the rivers
								must be from South to North, i.e. from the interior parts of the
								land towards the ocean. When we came towards the 5° South latitude,
								we found a small isle of about 80 leagues in circumference; the
								thermometer continued at about 3°, 3°, and 3°, in its neighbourhood,
								in the midst of summer; though isles have in general a milder
								climate than continents, we found, however, all this country
								entirely covered with immense loads of snow, the bottoms of its bays
								were choaked up with solid masses of ice, of 60 or 80 feet above
								water, and we saw no vestiges either of rivers or of springs. If
								this be the case in 5° South latitude, how can we then expect any
								springs or rivers in 6° or 7° South latitude, or rather still higher
								up to the South, where the sources of these imaginary rivers of the
								pretended Austral land, must be removed? It is therefore impossible
								to say, that the rivers of the Austral land carried those ice-masses
								into the ocean, which we met with in such stupendous quantities.</p><p n="107">There is one circumstance more, which surely most evidently proves,
								that there is no land in those latitudes, which are still capable of
								vegetation. In all the high Northern seas, there is constantly such
								a prodigious quantity of wood thrown on the shores of all the lands,
								viz. Nova Zemla, Spitzbergen, Greenland, Beering's-Island, &amp;c.
								&amp;c. that though none is growing there, the unfortunate
								individuals, that are obliged to spend a winter there, however, are
								sufficiently provided with this most necessary commodity. In all the
								Southern seas, there is no drifting wood to be met with. The French
								searched a great extent of the shores of the Falkland Islands, with
								great care, but found not above one or two pieces of wood thrown up
								by the sea; nor did we see any on the island of South-Georgia: all
								which sufficiently evinces the truth of the above assertion.</p><p n="108">The argument, therefore, is now reduced to this, "That salt-water
								does not freeze at all, or, if it does, the ice contains briny
								particles." But we have already before produced numberless
								instances, that the sea does freeze; nay, Crantz*<ref target="#jf51"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf51">* Crantz. p. 31.</note></ref> allows, that the
								flat pieces of ice are salt, because they were congealed from
								sea-water. We beg leave to add a few decisive facts relative to the
								freezing of the sea. Barentz=<ref target="#jf52"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf52">= Recueil des Voyages qui ont servi ... l'Establissement de la Compagnie des Indes Orientales. vol. 1.</note></ref> observes in the year 1596, September
								the 16th, the sea froze two fingers thick, and next night the ice
								was as thick again. This happened in the middle of September; what
								effect then must the intense frost of a night in January not
								produce? When Capt. JamesF<ref target="#jf53"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf53">F Histoire des Voyages, vol. LVII. edit. in 12mo. p. 421.</note></ref> wintered in Charleton's Isle, the sea
								froze in the middle of December 1631: it remains therefore only to
								examine, whether the ice formed in the sea must necessarily contain
								briny particles. And here I find myself in a very disagreeable
								dilemma, for during the intense frost of the winter, in 1776, two
								sets of experiments were made on the freezing of sea-water, and
								published,×<ref target="#jf54"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf54">× Mr. Nairne's experiments are found in the Philos. Trans. vol. LXVI. p. 1. and Dr. Higgins's in a second supplement to the Probability of reaching the North Pole. p. 121, 142.</note></ref> contradicting one another almost in every material
								point. The one by Mr. Edward Nairne F. R. S. an ingenious and
								accurate observer; the other by Dr. Higgins, who reads Lectures on
								Chemistry and Natural Philosophy, and consequently must be supposed
								to be well acquainted with the subject.5 I will therefore still
								venture to consider the question as undecided by these experiments,
								and content myself with making a few observations on them; but
								previously I beg leave to make this general remark, that those, who
								are well acquainted with Mechanics, Chemistry, Natural Philosophy
								and the various Arts which require a nice observation of minute
								circumstances, need not be informed, that an experiment or machine,
								succeeds often very well, when made upon a smaller scale, but will
								not answer if undertaken at large; and vice versa machines and
								experiments executed upon a small scale will not produce the effect,
								which they certainly have when made in a more enlarged manner. A few
								years ago an experiment made on the dying of scarlet, did not
								succeed when undertaken on a small scale, whereas it produced the
								desired effect when tried at a dyer's house with the large
								apparatus; and it evidently confirms the above assertion, which I
								think I have a right to apply to the freezing of salt-water. It is
								therefore probable, that the ice formed in the ocean at large, in a
								higher latitude, and in a more intense degree of cold, whereof we
								have no idea here, may become solid, and free from any briny
								particles, though a few experiments made by Dr. Higgins, in his
								house, on the freezing of salt-water produced only a loose, spungy
								ice, filled with briny particles.</p><p n="109">The ice formed of sea-water by Mr. Nairne, was very hard, 3 inches
								long, and 2 inches in diameter; it follows from thence, that the
								washing the outside of this ice in fresh water, could not affect the
								inside of a hard piece of ice. This ice when melted, yielded fresh
								water, which was specifically lighter than water, which was a
								mixture of rain and snow water; and next in lightness to distilled
								water. Had the ice thus obtained, not been fresh, the residuum of
								the sea water, after this ice had been taken out, could not have
								been specifically heavier than sea-water, which however was the case
								in Mr. Nairne's experiment. It seems therefore, in my opinion,
								evident from hence, that salt-water does freeze, and has no other
								briny Particles, than what adhere to its outside. All this perfectly
								agrees with the curious fact related by Mr. Adanson,*<ref target="#jf55"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf55">* Adanson Histoire naturelle du Senegal. Paris 1757, 4to. p. 190.</note></ref> who had
								brought to France two bottles of sea-water, taken up in different
								parts of the ocean, in order to examine it and to compare its
								saltness, when more at leisure; but both the bottles containing the
								salt-water were burst by being frozen, and the water produced from
								melting the ice, proved perfectly fresh. This fact is so fairly
								stated, and so very natural, that I cannot conceive it is necessary
								to suppose,=<ref target="#jf56"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf56">= Second supplement, to the Probability of reaching the North Pole, p. 119.</note></ref> without the least foundation for it, that the bottles
								were changed, or that Mr. Adanson does not mention the circumstance
								by which the sea-water was thus altered upon its being dissolved;
								for as he expressly observes the bottles to have been burst, it is
								obvious that the concentrated briny parts ran out and were entirely
								drained from the ice, which was formed of the fresh water only.</p><p n="110">The ice formed by Dr. Higgins from sea-water, consisted of thin
								laminae, adhering to each other weakly. Dr. Higgins took out the
								frozen ice from the vessels, wherein he exposed the sea-water, and
								continued to do so till the remaining concentrated sea-water began
								to form crystals of sea salt. Both these experiments therefore by no
								means prove what the Dr. intended to infer from thence; for it was
								wrong to take out such ice, which only consisted of thin laminae,
								adhering to each other weakly. Had he waited with patience, he would
								have obtained a hard ice as well as Mr. Nairne, which, by a more
								perfect congelation, would have excluded the briny particles
								intercepted between the thin laminae, adhering to each other weakly;
								and would have connected the laminae, by others formed by fresh
								water. The Dr. found afterwards, it is true, thicker and somewhat
								more solid ice, in the vessel B: but the sea-water had already been
								so much concentrated by repeated congelations, that it is no wonder
								the ice formed in it, became at last brackish: it should seem then,
								that no conclusive arguments can be drawn from these
								experiments.</p><p n="111">There are two other objections against the formation of the ice in
								the great ocean; the first is taken from the immense bulk and size
								of the ice masses formed in the ocean, which is the deepest mass of
								water we know of.*<ref target="#jf57"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf57">* Dr. Higgins's experiments, in the second supplement to the Probability, &amp;amp;c. p. 141.</note></ref> But the reader is referred to the table
								communicated above where it appears, that in the midst of summer, in
								the latitudes of 5°, 5° 26', and 6° South, at 100 fathoms depth, the
								thermometer was at 3°, 34° and 3°; and that in all instances, the
								difference between the temperature at top and at 100 fathoms depth,
								never exceeded 4 degrees, of Fahrenheit's thermometer, or that the
								temperature of the air did not differ five degrees from that of the
								ocean at 100 fathom deep. If we now add to this, that beyond the 7°
								South, the temperature of the air and ocean must be still colder,
								and that the rigours of an antarctic winter are certainly more than
								sufficient to cool the ocean to 28°, which is requisite for
								congealing the aqueous particles in it; if we moreover consider,
								that these severe frosts are continued during six or eight months of
								the year, we may easily conceive that there is time enough to
								congeal large and extensive masses of ice. But it is likewise
								certain, that there is more than one way, by which those immense ice
								masses are formed. We suppose very justly, that the ocean does
								freeze, having produced so many instances of it; we allow likewise
								that the ice thus formed in a calm, perhaps does not exceed three or
								four yards in thickness;*<ref target="#jf58"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf58">* Crantz, p. 31.</note></ref> a storm probably often breaks such an
								icefield, which Crantz allows to be 200 leagues one way, and eighty
								the other; the pressure of the broken fragments against one another,
								frequently sets one upon the other piece, and they freeze in that
								manner together; several such double pieces, thrown by another
								pressure upon one another, form at last large masses of miles
								extent, and of twenty, forty, sixty and more fathoms thickness, or
								of a great bulk and height. Martens=<ref target="#jf59"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf59">= Martens Voyages au Nord, tom. II. p. 62.</note></ref> in his description of
								Spitzbergen, remarks that the pieces of ice cause so great a noise
								by their shock, that the navigator in those regions, can only, with
								difficulty hear the words of those that speak; and as the ice-pieces
								are thrown one upon another, ice-mountains are formed by it. And I
								observed very frequently, in the years 1772 and 1773, when we were
								amongst the ice, masses which had the most evident marks of such a
								formation, being composed of strata of some feet in thickness. This
								is in some measure confirmed by the state in which the Cosack
								Markoff found the ice at the distance of 420 miles from the Sibirian
								coasts. The high masses were not found formed, as is suspected in
								the Second Supplement to the Probability of reaching the North Pole,
								p. 143-145, near the land, under the high cliffs, but far out at
								sea; and when these ice-mountains were climbed by Markoff, nothing
								but ice, and no vestiges of land appeared as far as the eye could
								reach. The high climates near the Poles, are likewise subject to
								heavy falls of snow, of several yards in thickness, which grow more
								and more compact, and by thaws and rain, are formed into solid ice,
								which increase the stupendous size of the floating
								ice-mountains.</p><p n="112">The second objection against the freezing of the ocean into such ice
								as is found floating in it, is taken from the opacity of ice formed
								in salt-water; because the largest masses are commonly transparent
								like crystal, with a fine blue tinct, caused by the reflection of
								the sea. This argument is very specious, and might be deemed
								unanswerable to those, who are not used to cold winters, and their
								effects; but whosoever has spent several winters in countries, which
								are subject to intense frosts, will find nothing extraordinary or
								difficult in this argument: for it is a well-known fact in cold
								countries, that the ice, which covers their lakes and rivers, is
								often opaque, especially when the frost sets in, accompanied by a
								fall of snow; for, in those instances, the ice looks, before it
								hardens, like a dough or paste, and when congealed it is opaque and
								white; however in spring, a rain and the thaw, followed by frosty
								nights, change the opacity and colour of the ice, and make it quite
								transparent and colourless like a crystal; but, in case the thaw
								continues, and it ceases entirely to freeze, the same transparent
								ice become soft and porous, and turns again entirely opaque.Q<ref target="#jf60"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf60">Q Marten's Recueil des Voyages au Nord, tom.2. p. 62.</note></ref> This,
								I believe, may be applicable to the ice seen by us in the ocean. The
								field-ice was commonly opaque; some of the large masses, probably
								drenched by rain, and frozen again, were transparent and pellucid;
								but the small fragments of loose ice, formed by the decay of the
								large masses, and soaked by long continued rains, we found to be
								porous, soft, and opaque.</p><p n="113">It is likewise urged as an argument against the formation of ice in
								the ocean, that it always requires land, in order to have a point
								upon which it may be fixed.=<ref target="#jf61"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf61">= Buffon, Hist. Nat. vol. I. p. 34.</note></ref> First, I observe, that in Mr. Nairne's
								experiments, the ice was generated on the surface, and was seen
								shooting crystals downwards; which evidently evinces, in my opinion,
								that ice is there formed or generated where the intensest cold is;
								as the air sooner cools the surface, than the depth of the ocean,
								the ice shoots naturally downwards, and cools the ocean more and
								more, by which it is prepared for further congelation. I suppose,
								however, that this happens always during calms, which are not
								uncommon in high latitudes, as we experienced in the late
								expedition. Nor does land seem absolutely necessary in order to fix
								the ice; for this may be done with as much ease and propriety to the
								large ice-mountains, which remain undissolved floating in the ocean
								in high latitudes: or it may, perhaps, not be improper to suppose,
								that the whole Polar region, from 8° and upwards, in the Southern
								hemisphere, remains a solid ice for several years together, to which
								yearly a new circle of ice is added, and of which, however, part is
								broken off by the winds, and the return of the mild season. Wherever
								the ice floats in large masses, and sometimes in compact bodies
								formed of an infinite number of small pieces, there it is by no
								means difficult to freeze the whole into one piece, for, amongst the
								ice, the wind has not a power of raising high and great waves. This
								circumstance was not entirely unknown to the ancients; and it is
								probable they acquired this information from the natives of ancient
								Gaul, and from the Britons, and other Northern nations, who
								sometimes undertook long voyages. The Northern ocean was called by
								the ancients the frozen, the dead, the lazy, and immovable sea:
								sometimes they gave it the name mare cronium, the concrete sea, and
								morimarusa, the dead sea.*<ref target="#jf62"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf62">* Dionys. Periegetes. v. 32. 33. [Greek quotes omitted.]

Morimarusa, the dead sea; Mor in the Welch is the sea, and marw, dead; so that mor-marw signifies the dead sea; in the Irish, muir-croinn is the coagulated, thick, concrete sea; (see Toland's History of the Druids, in the Collection of several Pieces.

								is well founded, and probably it has been adopted by voyagers on no
								other account, than because they found ice in a latitude, where it
								is seldom or ever to be met with in our Northern seas; but that may
								be produced by some peculiar causes." If we compare the
								meteorological observations made at Falkland's Islands, at about 5°
								South latitude, and communicated by Alexander Dalrymple, Esq, in his
								Collection of Voyages chiefly to the Southern Atlantic Ocean, with
								such as are every where made in Europe, in corresponding degrees of

								latitude, and in Sandwich Land, in about 5° and 5° South latitude,
								the whole land is covered with eternal snow to the shores of the
								sea, in the months of December and January, corresponding to our
								June and July; every unprejudiced reader will find it necessary to
								allow the temperature of the Southern hemisphere, to be remarkably
								colder than that of the Northern; and no one will, I believe, for
								the future, venture to question this curious fact in the Natural
								History of our Globe.</p><p n="115">But, as the inquisitive reader may require of me a solution of this
								curious and difficult phaenomenon, I will venture to deliver my
								opinion on the subject; and hope, that if it prove not entirely
								satisfactory, it may, however, contribute towards an explanation or
								many things, which perhaps were not before considered in this point
								of view. Having maturely considered every circumstance, I find that,
								with other causes founded on the apparent motion of the sun, the
								absence of land in the high latitudes of the Southern hemisphere,
								creates this material difference in the temperature of the air,
								between the corresponding degrees of latitude in the Arctic and the
								Antarctic hemispheres.</p><p n="116">In the Arctic regions, from 6° to 6° degrees and upwards, there is
								much land to be met with, viz. Iceland, Spitzbergen, the North of
								Norway and Sweden, all Lapland, all the Northern parts of European
								and Asiatic Russia: beyond its Eastern extremities in Kamtchatka,
								are those numerous isles lately discovered by the Russians; and the
								lands of North-America, about Hudson's and Baffin's Bay; and last of
								all, New and Old Greenland. Some of these lands are inhabited, and
								even cultivated, and bear various kinds of fruit and corn; and,
								during the short summers they enjoy, there is sometimes an intense
								heat, very little inferior to that between the Tropics. Let us now
								compare this with our experience in the Antartic hemisphere. We
								found no land wherever we sailed, about 6° and upwards to the South,
								except the two little spots in the Southern Atlantic ocean. The
								thermometer, in the height of summer, in these high latitudes, was
								never five degrees above the freezing point, and we saw it
								frequently pointing below it. We often had snow and sleet, and found
								our water in the skuttled watercask on deck, frozen during some
								nights. If all this happen in the midst of summer, what must the
								condition of these climates be during winter? The accounts of the

								much colder than the lands in any corresponding Northern degree.</p><p n="117">The sea being a transparent body, the beams of a sun penetrate a

								of 45 fathoms, the sea cannot reflect any beams of the sun, which
								are absorbed, and as it were swallowed up in the depth of the ocean:
								and as the reflection of the beams of the sun chiefly contributes to
								the warm temperature of the air, it hence becomes evident, that seas
								of great extent, which commonly exceed 45 fathoms in depth, have
								never so warm a temperature of the air, as the lands lying under the
								same parallel; and for the very same reason, islands of a moderate
								size, surrounded by a great ocean, are not so hot, as large
								continents situated under the same parallel. To these particulars
								may be added, the famous experiment of the burning mirror, whose
								focus, when directed on a quantity of water, produced no heat,
								whereas, in the same focus, any metal would instantaneously melt,
								vitrify and evaporate; nor can we omit the well known circumstance,
								that the sun moves eight days longer in the Northern, than in the
								Southern signs of the zodiac. This makes the winter eight days
								longer, and their summers eight days shorter; which all together
								must cool the Southern hemisphere, by a 2213/16 or very near by a
								23rd part more than the arctic regions.</p><p n="118"><q><emph>Cuncta gelu, canaque aeternum grandine tecta Atque aevi

								its formation and causes of the cold, had I not thought, that by
								collecting here as it were every material circumstance, relative to
								the ice in the Southern hemisphere, into one chapter, and examining
								what has been said on both sides of the question, some future
								navigators might be better enabled to judge, how far the observed
								facts correspond with the assigned causes. If they should find
								reasons to be of a contrary opinion, they will certainly be induced
								to publish the facts, upon which that opinion was founded; they will

								they will assert truth, by which science will be benefited and human
								knowledge enlarged. If on the contrary, the arguments alledged in
								behalf of my assertions are found incontrovertible, they probably
								will give my arguments new support and strength, and place beyond
								the reach of doubt, what I have endeavoured to hint at, as the only

								different constitution of its bottom, where we had any soundings; of
								the various tides; and of the dipping and variation of the
								magnetical needle; but I forbear to speak on these subjects, as they
								are partly the objects of the nautical observations, made by the
								officers of ships sent on this expedition, which have been presented
								to the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, and by their command
								are published in Captain Cook's nautical account;10 and as the board
								of longitude, had likewise charged two astronomers, to make accurate
								observations on magnetism and the tides, it would therefore be very
								improper, to attempt a business so ably discharged by others; who
								with proper instruments for that purpose, more leisure, and with
								more command of assistance, had better opportunities of making more
								perfect observations on these subjects.</p></div></div><div type="chapter" n="3" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head><l>CHAPTER III</l><l>Remarks on the Atmosphere, and its Changes, Meteors, and

								various changes and phaenomena, and shall treat first, of the
								aqueous meteors; because more closely connected with the former
								section.</p><p n="122">First, The climate within the tropics being very warm, and the nights
								rather long, the vapours raised in the day time by the heat of the
								sun, are condensed towards night, and fall frequently, as a dew on
								every part of the ship: and this we sometimes observed in the midst
								of the atlantic ocean, though at a great distance from any land. We
								had a few instances of a strong dew falling in the higher latitudes,
								of which I will only select one on January 8th, at 10 P.M. 1775;
								when we were sailing between 5° and 6° and far enough from land, we
								found the whole deck and all the rigging moistened by a copious dew.
								I am therefore inclined to believe, that a heavy fall of dew, cannot
								any longer be considered as a certain or infallible sign of the
								neighbourhood of lands.</p><p n="123">Secondly, The Tropical isles having been visited by us at two
								different times, viz. once from August to October, in 1773, and
								again from March to September, 1774, we can hardly from thence form
								an idea of the changes and the returns of the seasons, as, each
								time, during our whole stay, the sun was in the Northern hemisphere:
								however, if we consider that we were at O-Taheitee at the latter end
								of August, and again in April and the beginning of May, and that we
								found a very material difference in the external appearance of
								vegetation, we may be allowed to conclude, that this was owing to
								the difference of seasons; for, in countries between the tropics,
								Nature seems to be more uniform and constant in the setting in of
								winds and rains, than without the tropics. The difference was too
								striking not to be noticed; and, if it were not caused by the
								natural return of the seasons, it must have been produced by a very
								extraordinary deviation from the uniform tenor of the changes
								produced within the tropics; which may be possible, but hardly
								probable.</p><p n="124">The hills in O-Taheitee were covered in August with dry and dead
								herbage, a great part of it had been burnt by the natives, and gave
								the country a barren and dreary look. The isle had very little
								bread-fruit, few or no apples, and the bannanas were scarce: and if
								we except the eddoes, the greater part of vegetables were but
								moderately plentiful, and hogs scarcely to be had at all. But when
								we arrived eight months after, in April, the hills as far as their
								very summits, were clad with the most agreeable verdure; the trees
								on the plains were bending under the weight of bread-fruit; in the
								valleys the largest apple-trees were loaded with their excellent
								fruit;2 all the shores fringed by innumerable coco-nut trees,
								offered a vast profusion of these useful nuts; nay the valleys
								between the higher hills, were entirely covered with immense
								clusters of the horse-plantain, while each cottage was surrounded
								with considerable plantain-walks of the better sort, richly
								providing a more delicious food: we obtained in a little time a
								great quantity of large and well tasted hogs from the natives, and
								saw every where, more left. This so material difference was, in my
								opinion, caused by the natural change of seasons. When we came there
								the last time, the sun had then just left the Southern hemisphere;
								and it has been generally observed, that wherever the sun is
								vertical within the tropics, there its powerful beams accelerate the
								rising of the vapours, and cause a profusion of rain; which together
								with the vivifying influence of the sun, of course refreshes and
								quickens vegetation, infuses new life in all the animated part of
								nature, and produces plenty every where.</p><p n="125">But this very idea leads me to another view of nature. O-Taheitee and
								all the high islands, are in general more happy and more fertile,
								than the low islands, and those of a moderate height. The high hills
								in the middle of the first, attract by their situation, all the
								vapours and clouds that pass near them; there are but few days, on
								which their summits are not involved in fogs and clouds; and though
								it does not constantly rain there, yet such a regular supply of
								moisture is derived from these hills, that their very tops are
								crowned with lofty trees, and their sides fringed with shrubs and
								agreeable plants during the whole year; and all the surrounding
								valleys collect in their bosom the salutary humidity, which is not
								absorbed by these plants, and which is generously screened by them
								against the sun's power; so that in every one a gentle stream is
								collected from the smaller rills, which unite into one bed. This
								rivulet the natives stem here and there by wears, made of large
								stones, in order to water the plantations of eddoes; the frequent
								trees that are growing along the banks of the sweet purling stream,
								extend their shady branchs, give a coolness to the virgin-water, and
								thus bring refreshment, and the principles of life into the plains,
								where the rivulet begins to meander between the rich plantations of
								bread-fruit, apple and cloth trees, and bannana's, and spreads
								happiness and plenty. These rivers become the fountains and chief
								causes of the great variety of fruit, which grow every where; they
								enliven the picturesque scenery, and afford a cooling liquor for the
								inhabitants. Whereas the natives of the lower isles, have no other
								but coco-nut trees round their habitations, which thrive well in a
								sandy soil, and close to the sea-shore often within the reach of the
								spray; and the rain water preserved in deep filthy pits and ponds,
								full of green, slimy, aquatic plants, and stinking from its
								stagnation, is the only refreshing liquor they enjoy after they have
								been exposed on the reef (where they must resort for the fishery) to
								the parching sun and spray of the seas. Such is the difference in
								the dispensation of the salutary rains, caused by the different
								structure of the isles.</p><p n="126">Though the high hills constantly attract the moisture of the clouds
								and cause many rains during the whole year, there is however a
								season, when the rains are more copious; and this was just passed,
								when we came the second time to O-Taheitee; for all the streams and
								rivulets were full of water, whereas before, they had hardly water
								enough to moisten the ground.</p><p n="127">The very hills which are the cause of the fertility and happiness of
								these isles, produce likewise another phaenomenon, viz. as they
								attract the rising vapours, and passing clouds of the atmosphere:
								the temperature of the air is therefore frequently changed, and
								consequently sudden gusts of winds are produced by the change, with
								concomitant squalls of rain; this is an intimation to navigators of
								the vicinity of land, as we several times experienced. We had
								squalls and lightning on the 23d, of September 1773, when we
								discovered Hervey's Isle. The same happened after we had passed
								Mopeeha or Howe's Isle on June 7th, 1774; when we fell in with the
								Marquesas and O-Taheitee, we had some sudden gusts of wind with
								rain; when we came to Tofooa one of the Friendly Isles, when we came
								into the vicinity of Whitsuntide isle, and during a good while, that
								we were about the New-Hebrides; when we came to Norfolk-Isle, and
								near New-Zeeland, we experienced the same sudden gusts of wind with
								showers of rain; all which seems to have been likewise noticed by
								that intelligent observer, Mr. de Bougainville.*<ref target="#jf71"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf71">* See his voyage, p. 278, and 284 of the English edition.</note></ref></p><p n="128">Thirdly, that in the course of our voyage, we should especially to
								the South have Fogs is very natural, from the nature of the climate,
								and the analogy in the Northern hemisphere; nor would it deserve any
								further notice, was it not for a very curious, and as far as I know,
								quite new observation, first kindly communicated by that great and
								experienced navigator, Capt. Cook, and which I afterwards had
								frequent opportunities of seeing confirmed, by my own
								experience.</p><p n="129">If after a hard gale, with a high sea and a swell, we met with a
								clam, and a fog fell in at the same time, we observed that the
								swell, instead of gradually abating, as should be the natural
								consequence of a calm, always increased; which seems to be caused by
								the pressure of the atmosphere, loaded with such a quantity of
								aqueous particles, as is always the case in a fog.</p><p n="130">Fourthly, The repeated approach of our ship to the Antarctic circle,
								was often announced by the fall of snow, sleet, and hail: but the
								first year in 1772, we had snow very early in the latitude of 5° on
								December 11th. In the course of the following years, we never had
								snow, except when we came into the neighbourhood of that circle.
								However, it must be observed, this happened during the height of
								summer: what weather then must not the winter-season afford? We were
								happy enough to meet with no land to the South; which might have
								seduced us to spend a cold season somewhere on it, and to experience
								the rigors of an Antarctic winter.</p><p n="131">Fifthly, When we were going into Queen Charlotte's Sound, in the year
								1773, May 17th, we found ourselves nearly abreast of Cape Stephens,
								between three and four o'clock in the afternoon; the wind abated
								gradually, and we had almost a calm. It had rained the day before,
								and blew hard all the night; and in the morning the weather had been
								mild, pleasant, and warm, the thermometer standing at 56 °. At a
								quarter after four o'clock, we observed to the South-West some thick
								clouds; and to all appearance it rained on the Southern parts of the
								Cape. Immediately we saw a whitish spot on the surface of the sea,
								from whence a string or column rose upwards, while another soon
								after came down from the clouds, and joined the former.3 A little
								while after, we saw three more of these columns forming, the nearest
								of which was at the distance of about three miles; at its base,
								where it was considerably the largest, (its diameter appearing at
								that distance to be of 70 or 80 fathom in extent) the water of the
								sea was violently agitated, rose in vapours and steam, and, being
								illuminated by the sun, looked bright and yellowish, especially
								against the black clouds behind; but, before the sun shone out, it
								looked white. As these columns came nearer towards us down the
								streights, we had an opportunity of examining them more
								particularly. Their diameter above, towards the clouds, was larger
								than that in their middle, which latter seemd not to exceed two or
								three feet. The water was whirled upwards in a spiral: sometimes it
								seemed that there was a hollow space within the column, and that the
								water formed only a cylinder; for the body of the column had,
								towards its axis, a hue different from the rest, and much the
								appearance of a hollow glass tube. As these columns moved forwards
								on the surface of the sea, the clouds did not follow them equally
								fast; and this circumstance gave them an oblique position, and
								sometimes a curved shape. Their motions seemed not to be of equal
								velocity, nor apparently in the same direction; one seemed therefore
								to pass the others, and they were viewed across one another. In
								proportion as they came nearer to us, the sea appeared more and more
								agitated, by short, broken waves. We had then some wind, but by no
								means settled, for it blew in one quarter of an hour, almost from
								all points of the compass. The first of these four columns was the
								Southernmost, and lasted the longest; the Northernmost of them was
								the nearest to us, and moved apparently Southward, and likewise
								towards us; and, as the clouds, with which the upper parts of the
								columns were connected, did not follow with the same velocity, with
								which the lower parts moved on the surface of the water, they
								disappeared soon after; because the columns being drawn out, as it
								were, to too great a length, were necessarily broken.</p><p n="132">Whilst we were still observing these four water-spouts, we remarked,
								not above half a mile from the ship, on its starboard quarter, a
								spot on the sea of about 50 or 60 fathoms in diameter, more agitated
								than the rest. The water moved quick towards the center, in short
								and broken waves, and there being resolved in steam, rose up in
								spirals towards the clouds; but we could not so well distinguish the
								pillar, while it rose in this water-spout, as in the others, because
								the steam raised from the sea, obstructed the sight. The noise it
								caused, was like that of a cascade rolling down a deep glen. As this
								spout moved along towards the ship, it came abreast of it, and was,
								when nearest, within two cables length. A few hailstones fell during
								this time on deck. Soon after, another water-spout was discovered
								behind this last. A cloud of steam formed below, and moved upwards
								in a spiral, in a shape gradually decreasing towards the summit.
								Another cloud of a long slender form, tapering towards its lower
								extremity, seemed to descend towards the rising spout, and both ends
								united and became very cylindrical and erect; but in time moving to
								the South-East, it assumed an oblique and curved form; and at last,
								when it broke, we observed in its neighbourhood, a flash of
								lightning, but heard no explosion. The spout next to us had
								disappeared a short time before. It was then just five o'clock, and
								the thermometer was at 5°. We had several showers during the time of
								the appearance of the water-spouts, and had hauled up the courses,
								and clued up the top-sails.</p><p n="133">After the hard gale, which had blown the same year, from the 22d of
								October, at noon, till we were off Cape Palliser on the 29th, the
								gale still continuing strong, and the sea turbulent, I was told by
								the officers of our ship, that in the morning-watch several
								water-spouts had been seen. At eight o'clock we had a slight shower
								of rain, and immediately after the wind changed, the thermometer
								being at 51°.</p><p n="134">From these facts, I beg leave to draw the following corollaries.
								First, Water-spouts seem to be formed by eddies of winds, which, in
								their conflict, cause a circular motion of the air, contributing
								towards the raising of the sea-water in steam; and the vacuum,
								caused by the rarefied air in the midst of the column, seems to
								attract the clouds, and to give them a conic shape, whose point
								stands downwards.</p><p n="135">Secondly, From the flash of lightning, it should seem, that the
								clouds were then electric; and that therefore the coalition of the
								two tubes from the sea and the clouds, may be owing to electric
								attraction.*<ref target="#jf72"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf72">* In the Philos. Transactions, vol. xlvii. n. 80. p. 478. it is said, that a water-spout in Lincolnshire ended in a fiery stream. The spout, which made so great a havock at Rome, June 14th, 1749, observed by Father Boscowich, was continually emitting flashes of lightning on all sides. The spout also described by Dampier, vol. iii. p. 182, came out of a black cloud, that yielded great flare of rain, thunder, and lightning. See Dr. Franklin's Experiments and Observations on Electricity, 5th edit. London. 4to. 1774. p. 229 and 280. Mr. Adanson likewise observed a water-spout preceded by a thunder-storm, and found the spout extremely hot, which may be chiefly owing to the inflamed air, conveyed in this spout by an Easterly wind from the inland parts of Africa. Adanson's Voyage to Senegal.</note></ref></p><p n="136">Thirdly, Water-spouts are commonly formed near lands having
								projecting promontories, within narrow seas, straits, and other
								places where the winds form currents and eddies, and coming in
								conflict with other winds, take a contrary direction from the
								position of some promontory or strait. Those water-spouts, which
								Thevenot4 has described, were observed in the Persian Gulph, between
								the isles of Gu‚somo, Lar‚ca, and Ormus. A friend of mine saw
								several in the inundated rice-fields along Canton river in China.
								Dr. Shaw observed some in the Mediterranean, near the Capes Carmel,
								Greego, and Laodicea.5 Both our water-spouts were formed within, or
								near the entrance of Cook's Straits, between the two isles of New
								Zeeland, among many projecting head-lands, at the mouth of sounds
								and bays, extending several leagues up the country, and forming
								remarkable windings.*<ref target="#jf73"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf73">* Whoever is desirous of meeting with more instances of water-spouts being formed near lands, or in the eddies between two winds, may have recourse to the Philosophical Transactions, and Dr. Franklin's above-mentioned ingenious book.</note></ref></p><p n="137">Fourthly, Water-spouts are commonly observed in a calm, after hard
								gales, and sometimes after warm, mild weather, especially when the
								upper region of the air is remarkably cooler; for we had met with
								smart showers of rain the preceding day, and it blew hard all the
								night before: in the morning, the violence of the wind gradually
								abated, and it became mild. When the water-spouts were just forming,
								the thermometer was at 56°, which had been at 51° the day before.
								During the time that one of them approached us, some hail fell,
								which proves the upper region of the atmosphere to have been cooler
								than the lower, by 20 degrees at least; and, after the spouts had
								all disappeared, the thermometer was at 5°; consequently even the
								atmosphere below, had been remarkably cooled in three quarters of an
								hour.</p><p n="138">Mr. de Buffon, vol. ii. p. 287. edit. in 12mo, finds it necessary, in
								order to account for all the phaenomena attending water-spouts, to
								suppose that there is always a place under the sea, where some
								subterraneous fire releases a great deal of air, which raises the
								sea, causes a bubbling and a smoke, and unites the clouds with the
								sea, by a spout. But we cannot help remarking, that the vapours
								appeared to all of us, as steam raised by violent winds, and by no
								means as smoke produced by fire. Nay, had the place been heated by a
								subterraneous fire, the thermometer would certainly have risen
								higher; but we observed it to fall, which clearly proved the air to
								have become cooler. I will only add, that the rarefaction of the air
								and electricity, are certainly more than sufficient for the
								explanation of the various phaenomena of this meteor.</p><p n="139"><q><emph>Vocatur &amp; columna, quum spissatus humor rigensque ipse

								cloud; and he describes it as a thing very singular. Those who are
								acquainted with colours, and the various effects of their mixtures,
								know that green is naturally produced by mixing yellow and blue. The
								natural colour of the sky, and of a great many clouds, is blue: the
								setting sun commonly gilds all the sky and clouds near the horizon,
								with a lively gold-yellow or orange; it is, therefore, by no means
								extraordinary to see, at sun-setting, a greenish sky or cloud, and
								it may be observed frequently in Europe. But, as the rising and
								setting sun causes, between and about the tropics, the tincts of the
								sky and clouds to be infinitely brighter than any where else, it
								happens now and then, that all the appearances of the sky and
								clouds, are more striking and brilliant, and therefore more noticed.
								I had an opportunity to observe, in the year 1774, April 2d, in °
								30' South latitude, at sun-setting, a beautiful green cloud; some
								others at a greater distance were of an olive-colour, and even part
								of the sky was tinged with a lively, delicate green.</p><p n="141">Secondly, The refraction of light through clouds and rains, causes a
								Rainbow opposite to the sun; a phaenomenon which, however beautiful
								and striking, is so common, and the manner of its formation so well
								known, that it hardly requires here any particular notice: but I
								cannot pass by in silence, that whilst we were going, in 1773, from
								New Zeeland, the first time, to O-Taheitee, I had an opportunity of
								observing, from June 7th to July 12th, every morning constantly, a
								rainbow, or part of a rainbow, on the horizon. Though this remark is
								but trivial, it proves, however, that we had almost daily small
								showers of rain, and that we paid particular attention to every
								object which deserved observation.</p><p n="142">The fainter light of the moon causes likewise rainbows, but they are
								less noticed on account of their faint and weak colours; I observed
								one with remarkably bright colours on June 29th, 1773, another on
								July 6th, the same year, and another on March 19th, 1775, when near
								the Cape of Good Hope. Aristotle is, I believe, the first who
								observed this phaenomenon.</p><p n="143">Thirdly, when the air is charged with dense vapours, and often when
								they are frozen into snow or sleet, there appears a Halo about the
								sun or moon, which is by no means remarkable upon the whole; but it
								has been observed that Halos precede high winds, squalls and often
								rain and snow. Though I had frequent opportunities to see this
								observation confirmed, I did not however always minute it down in my
								journal; I find only the following memorandums. On February 25th,
								1774, we saw a large Halo about the moon, and that very night came
								on squalls with rain, and the next morning we had the same weather,
								with loud thunder claps. On January 5th, A.M. 1775, a large Halo,
								occupying more than 4° of the heavens, was seen about the sun, dark
								in the middle, bright and whitish with some colours of the rainbow
								in the circle, and we had rain, and now and then squalls.</p></div><div type="chapter" n="12" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head><l>SECTION III</l><l>FIERY METEORS</l></head><p n="144">First, OUR atmosphere is not only frequently charged with aqueous
								particles, which are productive of different appearances and various
								changes of the weather, but there are besides, so many heterogeneous
								particles dispersed through the whole mass of the circumambient air,
								that we are not yet apprized of the quantity and variety of them.
								Accurate observers discover from time to time some new ones, and
								make us acquainted with their effects, when variously combined. The
								electric matter has been found often to be one of the curious and
								powerful ingredients, that enter the mixture of the atmosphere. This
								matter causes in various instances different phaenomena. Lightning
								and Thunder are in all parts of the Globe caused by it. However we
								heard from the inhabitants of St. Helena, who were born there, and
								grown up to a good old age, that they never had observed a thunder
								storm on their happy isle. As the highest hills on it, and all the
								rocks surrounding it, are a kind of lava or vitrified slags of
								dross, which I suppose are, like all vitrescent bodies, electric per
								se, or non-conductors; the electricity of the atmosphere is perhaps
								not conducted by them, and causes therefore no explosion.</p><p n="145">The isles in the South-Sea are, as far as we know, subject to
								lightning and thunder storms; for we experienced some at different
								places and seasons, in the several parts of our voyage over this
								ocean; and we were now and then obliged to fix the electric chain,
								to prevent fatal accidents. Once at O-Taheitee, the man who was sent
								up to the main top-gallant mast head, had scarcely fixed the chain,
								and another man was still clearing it of the main-chains and
								shrouds, when the latter received an electric shock, and the fire
								was seen running down the chain into the water, without doing any
								damage.</p><p n="146">Secondly, on August the 17th, 1772, after we had left St. Jago, at
								eight o'Clock in the evening, we observed a fiery meteor, of an
								oblong shape, a bright but blueish light, and descending towards the
								North West, and then moving in an oblique direction towards the
								horizon: its duration was momentaneous. We had about that time,
								frequent showers of rain, attended with sudden and violent gusts of
								wind, both before and after its appearance.</p><p n="147">On the 30th of September, 1774, at half an hour after seven o'clock
								in the evening, after we had left the South East point of Caledonia
								and Pine Island, all those that were on the deck observed to the
								North-ward, a luminous globe, of the size and brightness of the sun
								moving downwards with great velocity towards the horizon. Its light
								was pale, and it burst without any explosion whatsoever; for all the
								noise which could be heard, seemed to be a loud hissing, familiar to
								that caused by oakum when set on fire. After its bursting, several
								bright sparks flew as it were from it; the lowermost of which had
								the shape of a pear, and could be traced by a blueish light it left
								behind. We were then becalmed, but as, according to the observation
								of several intelligent persons, the appearance of a fiery globe, has
								been the forerunner of a fresh gale, I expected one; and it was
								really verified that very night by such a gale, with squalls and
								rain. Though I am far from asserting that this, and perhaps a few
								more instances are sufficient to make this rule general, I think
								however that if these phaenomena and the following weather, were by
								further observers more carefully noticed, experience might lead us
								to some more general and more certain conclusions.</p><p n="148">Thirdly, the appearance of Northern Lights (Aurora Borealis) in the
								higher latitudes of our hemisphere, is at present a very common
								phaenomenon; and the inhabitants of Sweden, Norway, Ice-Land and
								Russia, have the sight of this meteor in the winter, almost every
								clear night; but I never heard or read of any one who had seen the
								Southern Lights (Aurora Australis) before us;1 and though we spent
								three different seasons in or near the antarctic circle, we however
								observed them the first time only in the year 1773, on seven
								different nights. We were at that time from 5° to 6° South latitude,
								and the thermometer at eight o'Clock in the morning, stood from 3°
								to 3° in the open air, on deck. Their appearance was much the same
								as that of the Northern Lights; they were observed shooting up to
								the zenith in columns or streams, of a pale light, from a dark
								segment as a base near the horizon, and often spread over the whole
								Southern hemisphere; sometimes these lights were so transparent,
								that stars could be observed through them, and at other times the

								transmit the light of the stars. We saw the meteors on February the
								18th, 19th, 20th, 21st, 26th, and on March 15th, and 16th.</p></div><div type="chapter" n="13" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head><l>SECTION IV</l><l>WINDS</l></head><p n="149">SOME of the most remarkable and general changes of our atmosphere are
								produced by the winds. Their history is as yet very imperfect, and
								will still remain so, for want of a sufficient number of accurate
								and faithful observations; and because mankind is strongly inclined
								to reap the benefit of their own labours as soon as possible,
								without leaving it to posterity, to make the conclusion from
								premises, for which the present, a second, and perhaps a third age
								should collect the materials. As soon as we have a tolerable number
								of facts before us, we begin to build thereon a system, filling up
								from guesses, surmises and doubtful inaccurate experiments the rest
								of the structure, which is afterwards found so tottering, that it
								soon either falls down, or is by adversaries torn to pieces.</p><p n="150">We shall therefore confine ourselves to the enumeration of facts, and
								leave the conclusions to others, or at most, offer them as, what
								they really are, conjectures.</p><div type="subsection"><head>I. REGULAR WINDS</head><p n="151">WE found within and near the tropics the regular winds, as other
									navigators had done before us. In the year 1772, we left England
									in July, and at Cape Finisterre, met with a North East wind,
									which carried us within a few degrees of the line, where,
									towards the latter end of August, we had rain and a S. S. W. or
									S. W. wind, which forced us to sail S. E. or S. E. by E. On
									September 8th, when we were near the line, the wind came to the
									South, but in two days more it veered round to S. S. E. so that
									we could run S. W. As we approached the tropic, the wind came
									more round to the East to E. by N. and even N. E. and we stood
									S. E. about the end of Sept. having just passed the tropic. On
									the 11th, of October we could stand E. by S. or nearly so, and
									Eastward, on the 16th, the wind being N. and N. by W. On the
									25th of October, we found the wind coming more Eastward, though
									now and then for a short time it blew from the West, so that we
									sailed briskly towards the Cape of Good Hope, and had the
									satisfaction to enter Table Bay, having had a fresh gale the
									preceding night. This view of the winds during our passage will
									shew at once the extent and the changes of the trade winds.
									Wherever one wind fell and another began, there we had faint
									breezes and calms, though of short duration.</p><p n="152">In the year 1773, in our run from New-Zeeland to O-Taheitee, we
									had, on the 20th of July, a S. E. wind in about 3° South
									latitude, which we thought to be the trade wind, though we were
									soon undeceived, having many changes of winds after it; and we
									did not fall in with the true settled S. E. trade, till August
									the 7th, in about 1° South latitude; this wind blew sometimes
									fresher, sometimes fainter, especially when we came near the
									isles, and it carried us to O-Taheitee on August 16th.</p><p n="153">After we left the Society Isles, we ran towards the Friendly
									Isles by help of the South East trade; though at the approach of
									a hard shower of rain and some lightning it shifted to various
									points; but we soon recovered the true trade wind, and perhaps
									the direction of the wind was likewise altered by the vicinity
									of some land; for though we saw no more than one low island in
									the whole run, we might pass several, at no great distance,
									without seeing them, either in the night, or on account of their
									low situation; for the next year we ran a little more North of
									this course and fell in with several isles; and this very South
									East wind brought us to Eaoowhe and Tonga-tabu.</p><p n="154">The same trade wind with very little changes, carried us after
									leaving Tonga-tabu, out of the tropics and even to about 3°
									South latitude. In the year 1774, when we returned from the
									South to the isles, we met the South East trade wind in about 2°
									South latitude on the 6th of March; it continued constant while
									we sailed to Easter-Island and after we left it. On March 21st,
									at three o'clock P.M. in about 2° 45' South latitude, the wind
									took us all on a sudden a-head, and we had soon after a smart
									shower of rain, but it was no sooner over than the trade wind
									returned, and blew fresh, and continued so, except in a few
									instances more, when we had some showers of rain. About the
									Marquesas we had rain and several gusts of wind.</p><p n="155">After we left the Marquesas, we stood S. S. W. then S. W. and at
									last W S. and had the same S. E. trade setting us forward; now
									and then changing our course, on account of five low isles we
									fell in with, till at last we came a second time to
									O-Taheitee.</p><p n="156">In our second run from the Society to the Friendly Isles, we had
									the same South-East trade wind, and now and then a foul West
									wind, when we came near land, or while a hard shower of rain was
									coming on, and sometimes we were becalmed. Having been a few
									days at A-Namocka, and passed between Oghao and Tofooa, we found
									a S. E. wind, which hindered us from going to Tonga-tabu as we
									originally intended; this breeze continued, with a few changes,
									till we fell in with the New Hebrides, where we had frequent
									squalls and rain, and sometimes calms: We had again Easterly
									winds in going to New Caledonia, and when near it were often
									becalmed, with now and then a squall and a hard shower of rain.
									After we left New Caledonia we had the wind South, but it veered
									gradually to W. S. W. and W. by S. and so on to the Westerly
									quarter, where it remained, and brought us to Queen Charlotte's
									Sound for the third time.</p><p n="157">In the year 1775, when we left the Cape of Good Hope, we had a
									fresh South-East breeze, which now and then became somewhat more
									Easterly, and at last we were becalmed from May 10th to the
									night of the 13th, when the true South-East trade set in, and
									carried us to the islands of St. Helena, Ascension, Fernando de
									Noronha, and to the 4th degree North latitude, where we were
									becalmed. From the time we left St. Helena, we had now and then
									squalls and showers of rain, which were more common about the
									Line. The calm lasted from June 15th to the 19th, and was
									accompanied with hard showers of rain, and set in with thunder
									and lightning. After this, we met again a breeze at North, which
									during the night veered to N. N. E. and N. E.; but, as we
									advanced farther to the North, the wind became more settled.</p><p n="158">Having passed the tropic of Cancer again, we found the wind
									became more Easterly, viz. E. N. E. and even sometimes E. by N.
									Half E.; till, in 2° or 2° North latitude, we again met with the
									variable winds.</p><p n="159">From this circumstantial account, the following inferences may be
									drawn.</p><p n="160">Firstly, The trade-winds extend sometimes beyond the tropics into
									the temperate zones, especially when the sun is in the same
									hemisphere; and the extent of the trade-winds within the
									tropics, seems to be proportionate to the sun's distance in the
									opposite hemisphere.</p><p n="161">Secondly, The trade-winds in the South-Sea, are sometimes
									interrupted by calms and contrary Westerly winds; and in
									particular, rains and thunder-storms are not uncommon at these
									changes.</p><p n="162">Thirdly, The trade-winds are likewise sometimes interrupted at
									the approach of land, especially if it be of considerable
									height.</p><p n="163">Fourthly, At the intervals, where one wind leaves off and the
									other sets in, commonly calms, and not seldom rains, are to be
									met with.</p><p n="164">It has hitherto been allowed, that, in the space within the
									tropics in large oceans, the regular winds reign, which come
									from the East; and the cause of this is thought to be the sun,
									which, being vertical, or nearly so, within the tropics at noon,
									rarefies the air, as his effect is then most powerful; but, as
									the sun is every moment advancing to the meridian of some other
									place on the globe, the rarefied part of the atmosphere of
									course moves from East to West. As soon as the cause of the
									rarefaction ceases by the removal of the sun, the columns of air
									in the neighbourhood of the rarefied place, rush in to cause an
									equilibrium. This current forms the trade-wind, and gives it
									continuance, within and near the tropics. The cause, however, is
									not so general, as that it may not be altered by some more
									powerful agent; such as the vicinity of land, or a cloud
									pregnant with vapours and electric matter.</p><p n="165">Though the lands in the South-Seas be of no considerable extent,
									they have however, generally, the benefit of the sea and
									land-breezes; so that the reigning trade-wind only operates in
									the daytime on the windward-side of the isle, and afterwards
									follows the direction of the shores, and falls every where
									perpendicular, or nearly so, upon them; nay, on the lee-side of
									the isle, it becomes contrary to the trade, but extends only a
									few miles more or less out to sea, in proportion to the size of
									the land and other accidental causes. In the night-time, the
									same wind, as it were, returns and goes out to sea from the
									land, keeping within the common limits of these alternate
									breezes.</p><p n="166">As the Easterly winds reign with a peculiar constancy within the
									tropics, it has been likewise observed, that, without them, the
									Westerly ones are the most general, but their constancy, both in
									strength and direction, must never be compared with that of the
									Eastern trade-winds.</p><p n="167">When we came far to the South, and were either within or near the
									antarctic circle, we found again, that the East winds are the
									most constant, and prevail the longest.*<ref target="#jf74"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf74">* See the Recueil des Voyages qui ont servi ... l'‚tablissement &amp;amp; au Progres de la Compagnie des Indes Orientales, vol. i. in the Third Voyage of Barentz.

									is probable that these Easterly winds are, as it were, only a
									kind of an eddy-wind, formed by the more general Western winds
									in the temperate zone. So that we might, perhaps, consider the
									whole in this manner: within the tropics, the great rarefaction
									of the atmosphere caused by the heat of the vertical sun
									produces the Eastern trade winds: this constant motion of the
									A‰rial Fluid to the East, causes towards the temperate zones a
									kind of eddy, so that the winds turn gradually South and North,
									and lastly West, which is the prevailing winds of both the
									temperate zones. But this streaming of the air to the East, is
									again in the cold frozen zones counterpoised by another kind of
									eddy wind from the East. We have already mentioned, that we wish
									that the facts we relate may be distinguished from our
									inferences, and guesses; the former are materials towards the
									history of the winds on our globe; the latter are private
									opinions, which, though they may be condemned, may nevertheless
									serve as hints, towards forming a more perfect system.</p></div><div type="subsection"><head>II. VARIABLE WINDS</head><p n="169">Though we have given a general view of the more prevailing winds
									in the temperate and frozen zones, we meant not by any means to
									say, that there are no other winds blowing in these zones; nay,
									we are so far from asserting this, that we will now give an
									instance to the contrary. When we crossed the Pacific Ocean,
									between 4° and 4° South latitude, in the year 1773, directing
									our course Eastward, we found in this run, contrary Eastern
									winds frequently to prevail; and what is more remarkable, when
									the winds again began to change, we observed four different
									times, between June 5th and July 5th, that they gradually went
									round the compass, but alway's against the sun.</p><p n="170">About New Zeeland, we observed the winds to be for the most part
									Westerly, and they are often in the winter very furious.</p><p n="171">In the seas between New Zeeland and Tierra del Fuego, in November
									and December, in the year 1774, we found a Western wind reigning
									from 4° to 5° South latitude.</p><p n="172">The neighbourhood of Tierra del Fuego, has been observed by other
									navigators, as the most tempestuous; but we found this sea
									remarkably smooth, and the weather mild; and though we
									experienced a few squalls, they were however, by no means more
									violent than some we had met with before in other seas.</p></div><div type="subsection"><head>III. STORMS</head><p n="173">We met with very little tempestuous weather, upon the whole,
									during our three years expedition; and had not any remarkable
									storms, except twice.</p><p n="174">When we left the Cape of Good Hope, on November the 23d, 1772,
									and were standing to the South, we had during three weeks, very
									hard gales and a high sea.</p><p n="175">And the second time, when we were running along the East coast of
									New Zeeland, towards Queen Charlotte's Sound, in October 1773,
									we met a hard gale, which gradually increased into a tempest; we
									were obliged to hand all our sails, and to lye to under our bare
									poles. The sea was long; the gale blowing off shore, tossed our
									poor ship strangely to and from, in a tempestuous ocean. The
									storm roared in the rigging, and broke the waves against the
									sides and over the decks of the ship. In one moment, being on
									the top of a mountainous wave, we could overlook an immense
									tract of this turbulent element; and with awe and terror, we
									beheld on both sides, the abysses scooped out as it were by the
									enraged winds; another moment hurried us down between the hollow
									waves, and we were overwhelmed by a deluge of brine. The furious
									tempest raises the sea, it breaks on the very summit of the
									wave, which by the storm is dissolved into atoms of vapours,
									involving the surface of the ocean in clouds of smoke and fog.
									Such was our situation, with very little relaxation for several
									days, and happy did we think ourselves, after having been
									disappointed several times, when, in a moderate interval, we
									could take refuge in the desired port.</p></div></div></div><div type="chapter" n="4" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head><l>CHAPTER IV</l><l>Remarks on the Changes of our Globe</l><l><q><emph>in nova fert animus mutatas dicere formas corpora.

							course of our navigation, of the waters, and the constitution and
							changes of the atmosphere, we have still some few remarks to make on the
							changes our globe has undergone, both from causes which come on in the
							regular course of nature, and likewise from others which are
							accidental.</p><div type="chapter" n="14" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head><l>SECTION I</l><l>REGULAR CHANGES</l></head><p n="177">THE constant succession of summer and winter, of heat and cold, is in
								the temperate zones, in general more striking and remarkable than in
								the torrid zone: but I may, perhaps, with equal truth assert, that
								the tropical isles of the South Sea, enjoy more eminently than any
								others, an equal temperature and constant mild weather, by their
								happy situation in a great ocean, where constantly alternating sea
								and land breezes, mitigate the violence of a vertical sun.</p><p n="178">New-Zeeland enjoys, according to the kind informations of Capt. Cook,
								more settled and more distinct seasons, changing the temperature of
								the air from warm to cold. This able navigator certainly could give
								the best account of it, having passed in the Endeavour, about six
								months, during their summer, along the coasts of New-Zeeland. We
								came afterwards, in March, to the same isle, and remained till June;
								and twice we were there in October, and in November; so that, by
								this means, a very good judgment might be formed of the seasons of
								this isle. In its Southern parts we found in March still mild
								weather, which continued partly in April; but in May, the
								tempestuous winds, constant rain, with sleet, hail, and snow, and
								very great storms of lightning and thunder, began to set in; the
								verdure every where faded, many trees shed their leaves, and the
								snowy summits of hills, attended by a piercing cold, convinced us,
								that the winter-season was begun.</p><p n="179">In the month of June, in Queen Charlotte's Sound, we found the
								climate milder than in Dusky-Bay; which, however, changed
								considerably during our three weeks stay: but, when Capt. Cook was
								there in the Endeavour, in 1770, he found the finest warm, and even
								hot weather, in the summer-season, and every thing vegetating in the
								greatest luxuriance.</p><p n="180">We, who had spent our winter in the tropical isles, and the spring in
								New Zeeland, and felt the effects of a most uncomfortable summer in
								Tierra del Fuego and South Georgia, could not but think ourselves
								completely unhappy; and a single momentary recollection of the
								winters of those wretched climates, is even now sufficient to make
								us shudder at the very thought of it.</p><p n="181">However, we find that these changes of the season in the tropical and
								temperate zones, cause considerable alterations; which produce
								likewise, a very considerable effect upon our globe, and is
								infinitely more conspicuous there, than in the more rigid climates.
								The constant succession of vegetation within the tropics, infuses
								every where life, and affords food to millions of animated beings,
								of the human and animal kind; the temperate zones have still
								vegetation enough to enliven the scene, and to feed many thousands;
								but the whole creation seems lifeless and torpid, in the frozen
								climates of Tierra del Fuego, and Staten Land; and the little life
								which is left to nature, is confined to a very short space of time;
								and even its greatest activity, in the motion of whales, seals and
								pinguins, the only numerous inhabitants of these regions, is
								absolute torpor, when compared with the agility of the animated
								beings of warmer and more happy regions.2 In proportion as places
								lie nearer to the course of the sun; soil and mould, the great
								promoters of vegetation are increased; and in the same proportion
								all organic bodies animate the lifeless, chaotic part of the strata
								of our globe. But as I have already spoken of these changes, it may
								be sufficient here to hint at them only.</p></div><div type="chapter" n="15" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head><l>SECTION II</l><l>ACCIDENTAL CHANGES</l></head><p n="182">IF we consider the changes our globe has undergone from accidental
								causes, we find the Artificial changes made on the surface of our
								globe by mankind, not to be the least considerable.</p><p n="183">Where man the lord of the creation on this globe, has never attempted
								any change on it, there nature seems only the thrive; for in reality
								it languishes, and is deformed by being left to itself.*<ref target="#jf75"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf75">* Mr. de Buffon, premiere Vue de la Nature, vol. xxiv. de l'Edit. en 12mo.</note></ref>
								Impenetrable woods cover the surface of these regions; its trees are
								no doubt here and there large and fine, but many are decayed, and
								still more lying on the ground rotting; here is a tree without its
								rind, another without a top; all the ground below is over-run with
								briars, and weeds, and climbers, which hinder you from setting a
								foot forward: all that seems to vegetate and thrive is suffocated,
								and buried under mosses, lichens and mushrooms. The water stagnates
								every where, and causes immense swamps, which are unfit to serve
								either the inhabitants of the land, or those of the water; being
								over-run with gigantic but coarse plants, affording very little food
								to the more useful parts of the animated creation.1</p><p n="184">As soon as the lord of the creation appears in these regions, he
								eradicates all those vegetables, which afford no nutriment to him,
								and to other useful animals. He opens a passage for himself and his
								assistants. He preserves those plants, and cultivates those
								vegetables, which afford food, and other useful productions. All
								that is broken, decaying, and rotting, he carefully clears away,
								preserving the air from putrefaction and noxious effluvia. He opens
								a channel for the dead, motionless, stagnating waters, which, being
								endued by motion, with new life and limpidity, become serviceable to
								a whole world of creatures, for whom its fluid was originally
								destined. The earth becomes dry; its rich soil is soon covered with
								a new verdure, forming a brilliant sod, enamelled with the most
								fragrant flowers. Every where animals feed in these new meadows,
								which are created by the industry of man, and supported by his
								ingenious contrivances. The violence of the vertical sun no sooner
								begins to fade this new paradise, than man spreads, for a short
								time, the refreshing and salutary waters of the purling, limpid
								stream over its surface, and restores life and vegetation. Here a
								bread-fruit spreads its shady branches, and on their extremities,
								offers an agreeable food to its planter. The apple-tree, covered
								with its golden fruit, seems to vie with the former, in the number
								and agreeable taste of its production. There the young shoots of a
								mulberry-tree grow up luxuriantly, whose bark is soon to become the
								garment of its cultivator, and screen him against the heat of the
								sun, and the cold of the nocturnal air. How beautiful, how improved,
								how useful does nature become by the industry of man! and what happy
								changes are produced, by the moderate care of rational beings!2</p><p n="185">Every one must perceive, though we forbore to name the countries
								which we have thus compared, that the former is the picture of the
								wildes of New-Zeeland, in the Southern isles; and who can fail to
								discover Taheitee, the happiest isle of the South-Seas, in the
								latter representation?</p><p n="186">Among the accidental natural causes of the changes on our globe, the
								most remarkable ones are, the winds, the rains, the waters of
								rivers, the tides of the ocean, the currents therein, subterraneous
								fires, and earthquakes: but, as we did not stay long enough in the
								several isles of the South-Sea, to make accurate observations on
								these changes, we can say nothing on that subject.</p><p n="187">But, as we had an opportunity of seeing three different volcanos in
								the year 1774, and were for several weeks, very near to one of them,
								I will here insert my remarks on that subject.</p><p n="188">Two days after our arrival at Namocka, at day-break we were agreeably
								surprized by the sight of more then 13 low islands, none of which we
								had seen before; besides them, we discovered two high ones, the
								Westernmost of which, constantly emitted great quantities of smoke.3
								The natives call this isle To-fo•a. Two days after, we passed with
								the ship between it and Ogh...o, another high isle, divided from the
								former by a narrow channel. To-fo•a was covered up to its summit,
								with great quantities of clubwood (casuarina equisetifolia), and we
								saw many coco-nut trees, and some plantains. The natives assured us,
								there grew bread-fruit and yams on it, and that it had a run of
								fresh water. Its shores consisted of black rocks, that had the
								appearance of being burnt, and the greater part of them had the form
								of pillars, and were much honey-combed. The beaches were covered
								with a black sand; and we found, on the shores of the neighbouring
								isle of A-Namocka, many pumice-stones. The smoke rolled out of the
								summit of the hill in the middle of the isle. When we came to the
								leeward of it, it rained, and our people on deck complained that the
								drops falling on their eyes produced pain and uneasiness; they
								smelled likewise something like the burning of turf, or of some
								vegetables and fern; but I did not observe these two latter
								particulars, though I was likewise all the time on deck. With the
								rain, some ashes fell down, which seemed to be pieces of small
								pumice-stone. On the North-West side of the isle there was a large
								part of the hill, from whence the smoke issued, which appeared to be
								lately burnt, for it was all black, and the bushes were without
								foliage and verdure, and only here and there, in craggy places and
								crevices, a few greens appeared. As we found no anchorage near this
								isle, and squally weather was coming on, we had no opportunity to
								make farther observations on this volcano.</p><p n="189">When we were in the midst of the New-Hebrides, having passed
								Whitsuntide Isle, we saw a large fine island to the South of it,
								which had all the appearance of the greatest fertility and highest
								cultivation. We remarked on its summit, in two places, a smoke
								rising, of a much greyer hue, than that from ordinary fire, which we
								could likewise see rising here and there on the isle, where the
								natives dressed their victuals. Coming afterwards to Mallicollo, we
								learned from the natives, that this isle was called Ambrrym, and
								that there was a fire coming out from hills.4 We observed on the
								South-East side of the isle, which is gently sloping, and has a very
								beautiful appearance, white columns of smoke, rolling with great
								velocity and strength out of the summit of one of the inland hills,
								which, however, was not the highest hill on the isle. The North
								shores of Mallicollo were covered with pumice-stones of various
								sizes.</p><p n="190">These obvious remarks on this volcano, were all that our very short
								stay at Mallicollo, and in its neighbourhood, would permit us to
								make.</p><p n="191">The isle of Tanna was seen by us, after we left Irromanga.5 The night
								preceding our arrival, we observed a very great fire on this isle,
								and we saw it every now and then blazing up with great violence. In
								the morning we were a few miles distant from the isle, and saw
								plainly a volcano on its South-East side, at the end of a low range
								of hills, not elevated more than 120 or 150 yards above the surface
								of the sea; beyond which there appeared another ridge, at least as
								high again. It seemed not above four miles distant from the sea, and
								looked like a truncated cone, quite barren, of a reddish grey, and
								had the appearance of being formed by ashes, pumice-stones, and
								lava. Every four or five minutes we perceived a strait column of
								smoke, of a reddish grey cast, rising with great velocity and
								violence; and soon after we heard a rumbling noise in the volcano
								like that of thunder. After the smoke, or rather mass of ignited
								ashes, had risen to a considerable height, the resistance of the
								air, and its own gravitation, brought it down: it varied from the
								columnar shape, and branched out into separate masses, assuming a
								surface and out-line, not unlike a large cauliflower.*<ref target="#jf76"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf76">* Nubes (incertum procul intuentibus ex quo monte: Vesuvium fuisse postea cognitum est) oriebatur, cujus similitudinem &amp;amp; formam non alia magis arbor quam pinus expresserit.

								these ashes appeared white, sometimes they had a dirty grey, and
								sometimes a very red cast which happened, as I suppose, when the hot
								ignited ashes were thrown up, or when the smoak and ashes were
								illuminated by the fire at the bottom of the crater.</p><p n="192">After we came into the harbour, the volcano seemed to be about 6 or 8
								miles distant, its explosions continued for several days, and lasted
								sometimes, together with the rumbling noise, for about half a
								minute: the whole deck was covered with ashes and minute cinders,
								which was very hurtful to the eyes. One morning after rain, the
								volcano, which had ceased its loud explosions, did again now and
								then blaze up. I observed this before 4 o'clock in the morning. The
								clouds of smoak which were emitted, had all the various hues from
								yellow, orange, red, and dark purple, dying away into a reddish
								grey, or into a darker hue. When night had spread its veil over all
								the objects, surrounding us, the stars were observed to shine
								through some lucid spots. As often as fresh clouds of smoak
								appeared, they were illuminated from the bottom of the crater. Each
								neighbouring object, when exposed to this light, was on its edges
								tinged yellow, orange, red, or purple. Some days after, the volcano
								was quiet, and no more noise was heard, and but few clouds of smoak
								appeared, which however, during night were illuminated.</p><p n="193">Seven days after our first arrival, I made an attempt to go to the
								volcano, in hopes of examining this great object somewhat nearer;
								and went therefore on a path up the hill towards it. It had rained
								the night before, and we were not gone a mile up the sides of the
								hill from the watering-place, when we came to a spot clear of wood
								and of reeds, where we saw a smoak or steam rising from the ground:
								its smell was strongly sulphureous; and the earth was so intensely
								hot, that we could hardly stand on it. The soil about these
								spiracles looked whitish like clay: and in other places of its
								neighbourhood like red ochre. The fumes rising were real steams, and
								in all appearance not noxious to vegetation; for I observed several
								fig-trees loaded with fruit, within 2 or 3 yards of them. I traced
								these solfataras up the hill, in several other places, and as that
								day the volcano made a great many loud explosions, we could plainly
								see, that a new quantity of vapours rose from these spiracles after
								each explosion. I traced these spiracles another time likewise, down
								the hill, within a few yards of the sea, where at high water mark,
								several hot wells were found by us.</p><p n="194">From the ship we observed, that the volcano threw up ignited stones
								of an immense size: for as we were about 6 or 8 miles off, the
								stones must be of a considerable bulk to be visible at such a
								distance. When we left the island, there appeared on the outside of
								the volcano among the ashes, a smoaking ridge, which was not
								observed at first when we came into the harbour. And as I had before
								seen on a cliff near the sea, some pieces of lava, it is probable
								this smoaking place, contained a stream of ignited slags, forming,
								when cold, the lava. All the environs of the volcano are covered
								with ashes, the sand on the sea shore consisted of them, and the
								soil on the hills was mixed with them: which I found to consist of
								small pieces of pumice-stone, of small portions of shining,
								irregularly shaped glasses, semitransparent slags of white,
								pellucid, irregular pieces like Sherl, or glass, of shining,
								fibrous, acerose particles like asbest; and lastly, of some black,
								opaque, irregular atoms. These ashes fell at the distance of 8 or 10
								miles on one side or the other, according as the winds blew. From
								the preceding account I have reason to draw the following
								corollaries.</p><p n="195">Firstly, Volcanos are not always formed on the highest mountains, but
								are sometimes on a lower ridge, in the neighbourhood of still higher
								hills. I will not deny that there may be instances, where volcanos
								occupy the summits of great, high mountains, but I suppose they are
								found both in high and low hills.</p><p n="196">Mr. de Buffon in his most ingenious work, on the Theory of the Earth,
								pretends that volcanos are never to be met with but in high
								mountains. This assertion seems not to correspond with our
								experience, for a hill of about 150 yards at highest, deserves
								scarcely to be called a high mountain, nor are those volcanos we saw
								at To-fo•a and Ambrrym much higher.</p><p n="197">Secondly. A great many volcanos, if not the greater part of them, are
								found on isles or on the continent, at no great distance from the
								sea. Such are Aetna, Stromboli, Lipari, and Vulcano, Fuogo, the Peak
								of Teneriffe, Volcano Island, in the Queen Charlotte Islands, the
								volcanos near New Guinea, and the Moluccas, the Manillas, in Japan,
								Iceland, and the new discovered islands between Kamtchatka, and
								North America: of the latter fort is Vesuvio, the volcanos in
								Kamtchatka and California: and the only ones that should seem to
								make an exception, are the volcanos in the Andes, in South America
								and Mexico; but even there, none is above 100 miles in a straight
								line, distant from the sea. Those which we found in To-fo•a,
								Ambrrym, and Tanna, belong to the first class.</p><p n="198">Thirdly, Volcanos are to be met with, only in countries containing a
								good many pyritical, sulphureous substances. The red ochre we found
								on the sides of the hills in Tanna, where the spiracles were seen by
								us, looked exactly like the remains of a pyrites containing sulphur
								and an iron earth, which had been ustulated and calcined in a strong
								fire. Those who have visited the neighbourhood of other volcanos,
								know very well that such red, ochreous strata are very common in
								their neighbourhood.</p><p n="199">Fourthly, We found that after rain, the volcano in Tanna began to
								rage and blaze more violently than before; which seems to imply,
								that the moisture of the rain, insinuating itself into the interior
								parts of the volcano, through various crevices and chinks, and
								meeting these pyritical strata, caused a new fermentation, followed
								by new eruptions and violent explosions.</p><p n="200">Fifthly, Volcanos, no doubt, cause great changes on the surface of
								our globe, by accumulating the ashes and pumice stones, which they
								continually emit, and by the streams of lava, which often are thrown
								up by them and run a considerable distance, causing great ravages in
								cultivated regions: we certainly have reason to believe, that the
								whole hill where the volcano was at Tanna, had been considerably
								enlarged by the ashes, pumice stones, and lava. Nay, the soil of the
								whole island had been altered by the continued fall of ashes. I
								observed besides this, a cliff to the East of the volcano near the
								sea, at more than ten miles distance from it, which certainly
								contained vestiges of a great revolution. It consisted of a black
								sandy or gritty stratum, full of pumice stones, a great many red,
								ochreous stones, and pieces of lava.</p></div><div type="chapter" n="16" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head><l>SECTION III</l><l>On the diminution of the sea and water</l></head><p n="201">THIS subject has of late been treated in various manners by the
								learned world. Some have endeavoured to prove, that the sea
								gradually made a regular recession from the land, and they have
								corroborated this opinion, with every argument they could possibly
								devise. In Sweden it has been the favourite opinion of the most
								eminent philosophers. But as all opinions may be carried too far, so
								it has happened in this particular instance. One of the historians
								of that kingdom, Mr. Dalin, pretends that the ocean falls 45 Swedish
								inches = 3713/16 English inches in 100 years, and consequently 0,45
								= 0,37 in one year: and by this means proves when Sweden first
								became habitable, which he immediately considers as the time when it
								was actually inhabited. There are others who have opposed this very
								opinion; so that it seems by no means, to be a point as yet decided;
								nor is it yet, as far as I am able to judge, a proper time to decide
								the question: we are first to collect a great many facts, and by no
								means to form systems from a few particulars, which perhaps may be
								proved to arise from other causes, than the recession of the sea;
								and if in one place, the sea uncovers some ground, we ought likewise
								as carefully and faithfully to record the places where the sea has
								made encroachments upon the land; which, if rightly compared, might
								shew, that what in one place is gained, is lost in another. Nor do
								these gentlemen consider, that, should the ocean decrease, nothing
								but the aqueous particles would naturally be diminished, and the
								saline, as fixed particles would remain, which of course must
								constantly increase the saltness of the ocean; and such fish and
								submarine animals as can now subsist in the ocean, would, in course
								of time, find themselves in an element by no means suited to their
								life and necessities: nay, as their organs for swimming are by no
								means adapted to so dense a fluid, they would lastly die, and the
								ocean would in a little time after, shoot into crystals of salt and
								become entirely solid. Rain, dew, and vapours would be formed, every
								century more and more sparingly, and at last no vegetation or animal
								life could be supported, and would end with the subversion of this
								our globe.</p><p n="202">I met with one instance only, during our expedition, where I could
								fairly observe, that the ground had been raised. It is well known,
								and often remarked in the South Sea, that the animalcules forming
								the lithophytes, create in the sea curious structures: they are
								commonly narrow below, and have as it were only one stalk: the more
								they grow, the more they spread above, so that some of them are
								found above 15 feet high, expanding from a base of two or three
								feet, to 18 or 20 on the top, but as the animalcules inhabiting
								these lithophytes, cannot live out of water, they never extend their
								structure higher than to the waters edge, at low water mark.</p><p n="203">When we came on the 3d of July, 1774, to Turtle Island, we saw on the
								reef several such lithophytes of the abovementioned heighth and
								size: they were perfectly above water, and on their spreading tops,
								some plants were already growing; which shews that they are above
								high water mark: and besides this, should they be now again covered
								by the sea, half of the isle, which is not very high, would
								certainly be drowned, with all its trees, and the habitations of the
								natives. It appears therefore evidently, either that the water had
								receded, or that these objects had been raised above water; but what
								might be the cause of either, I will not pretend to decide. It might
								be owing to the recession of the sea, and its gradual yearly
								diminution. But an earthquake, and a subterraneous fire, are most
								likely to have raised these lithophytes and parts of the
								neighbouring isle above water.</p></div><div type="chapter" n="17" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head><l>SECTION IV</l><l>The theory of the formation of isles</l></head><p n="204">HAVING thus offered a few remarks on the various changes of those
								parts of the globe, which we visited during our circumnavigation, I
								might here leave the subject, were it not in some measure necessary,
								to add a few observations, which may serve to establish a theory for
								the formation of the tropical isles in the South-Sea.</p><p n="205">When we first came within the tropics in 1773, I applied particularly
								to study the constitution and nature of the tropical isles. When we
								visited them again in 1774, I added many more observations; and,
								after all, I found the nature of these isles to be just such as I
								represented them in the section, where I described the lands we had
								fallen in with.</p><p n="206">We found low isles, connected by reefs of coral rocks; we met with
								islands more elevated, some without a reef, and other surrounded by
								a reef of lithophytes.1</p><p n="207">All the low isles seem to me to be a production of the sea, or rather
								its inhabitants, the polype-like animals forming the lithophytes.
								These animalcules raise their habitation gradually from a small
								base, always spreading more and more, in proportion as the structure
								grows higher. The materials are a kind of lime mixed with some
								animal substance. I have seen these large structures in all stages,
								and of various extent. Near Turtle-Island, we found, at a few miles
								distance, and to leeward of it, a considerable large circular reef,
								over which the sea broke every where, and no part of it was above
								water; it included a large, deep lagoon. To the East and North-East
								of the Society-Isles, are a great many isles, which, in some parts,
								are above water; in others, the elevated parts are connected by
								reefs, some of which are dry at low-water, and others are constantly
								under water. The elevated parts, consist of a soil formed by a sand
								of shells and coral rocks, mixed with a light black mould, produced
								from putrefied vegetables, and the dung of sea-fowls; and are
								commonly covered by coco-nut trees and other shrubs, and a few
								antiscorbutic plants. The lower parts have only a few shrubs, and
								the above plants; others still lower, are washed by the sea at
								high-water. All these isles are connected, and include a lagoon in
								the middle, which is full of the finest fish; and sometimes there is
								an opening, admitting a boat or canoe in the reef, but I never saw
								or heard of an opening that would admit a ship.</p><p n="208">The reef, or the first origin of these isles, is formed by the
								animalcules inhabiting the lithophytes. They raise their habitation
								within a little of the surface of the sea, which gradually throws
								shells, weeds, sand, small bits of corals, and other things on the
								tops of these coral rocks, and at last fairly raises them above
								water; where the above things continue to be accumulated by the sea,
								till by a bird, or by the sea, a few seeds of plants, that commonly
								grow on the sea-shore, are thrown up, and begin to vegetate; and by
								their annual decay and re-production from seeds, create a little
								mould, yearly accumulated by the mixture with sand, increasing the
								dry spot on every side; till another sea happens to carry a coco-nut
								hither, which preserves its vegetative power a long time in the sea,
								and therefore will soon begin to grow on this soil, especially as it
								thrives equally in all kinds of soil; and thus may all these low
								isles have become covered with the finest coco-nut trees.</p><p n="209">The animalcules forming these reefs, want to shelter their habitation
								from the impetuosity of the winds, and the power and rage of the
								ocean; but as, within the tropics, the winds blow commonly from one
								quarter, they, by instinct, endeavour to stretch only a ledge,
								within which is a lagoon, which is certainly entirely screened
								against the power of both: this therefore might account for the
								method employed by the animalcules in building only narrow ledges of
								coral rocks; to secure in their middle a calm and sheltered place:
								and this seems to me to be the most probable cause of the origin of
								all the tropical low isles over the whole South-Sea.</p><p n="210">We come now to the higher ones. I must confess, there is hardly one
								of them, which had not one way or other, strong marks and vestiges
								left, of its having undergone some violent alteration in its surface
								by fire, or, as I should rather say, by a volcano.</p><p n="211">It is very well known, that many isles*<ref target="#jf77"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf77">* Plin. Hist.

								These seem to have been a kind of volcano coming out of the bottom
								of the sea. We visited isles that had still volcanos; others, that
								had only elevation, and marks of being formed in remote ages by a
								volcano; and lastly, we found isles, that had no remains of a
								volcano, but even strong and undoubted vestiges of having been
								violently changed, and partly overturned by an earthquake,
								subteraneous fire, and a volcano. Tofooa, Ambrrym, Tanna, and Pico,
								are of the first class. Maatea, O-Taheitee, Huaheine, O-Raiedea,
								O-Tahaw, Bola-Bola, Mourua, Waitahu, or St. Christina, and the rest
								of the Marquesas, with several of the New-Hebrides, and Fayal,
								belong to the second; and I cannot help referring Easter-Island, St.
								Helena and Ascension to the last.</p><p n="212">I will not from hence insist, that all the isles now enumerated, were
								originally produced by earthquakes and volcanos, but I may venture
								to assert this of several, from their external appearance, and of
								others I am certain, that they existed above water, before they had
								a volcano, and were entirely changed, and partly subverted by
								subterraneous fire.</p><p n="213">Ascension, in the Atlantic Ocean, an isle which we saw last, after
								all the others, furnished me with some very curious and pertinent
								remarks on the subject. We anchored in Cross-Bay, and saw the
								highest hill of the isle at about five miles distance from the
								shore; it consists of a gritty lime-tophus, mixed with marle and
								sand. Some parts of this stone being decayed by length of time,
								form, together with a little mould, the surface, which is covered
								with purslane, and some grasses. The nature of this hill is, in
								every respect, different from the rest of the isle, especially about
								Cross-Bay. For, as soon as we had reached the elevated plain,
								situated between the bay and the hill, which is a-breast of the bay,
								we found it about two miles in diameter, covered with black, gritty
								slag-ashes, and in some places with a dusky yellow ochre. At sixty
								or eighty yards distance, the plain is all over incumbered with
								little hummocks, about ten or twenty feet high, formed of very
								rugged slags and porous cinders; in short, of lava. All this plain
								is inclosed by several hills, of a conic form, and of a
								reddish-brown or rusty-coloured cast, consisting entirely of small
								ashes, and gritty dissolved slags; some of which are black, and
								others of an ochreous nature, and of a yellow or red colour. On one
								side of the plain is an elevated ridge of rocks of the most craggy
								appearance, lying in very irregular masses, and terminating in the
								most curious manner, in points and sharp prominencies. Part of this
								ridge we could trace towards the sea, where the slags, if possible,
								assumed still more horrid shapes, intersected by deep gullies,
								forming a tremendous, inaccessible shore. The slags or lava ring
								like bells; and, if a piece of it be broken and thrown down the
								sides of these steep craggy masses, it produces a sharp clanging
								sound. At the very first sight of these objects, nothing is more
								obvious to every beholder, than that the high peak in the middle of
								the isle, is one of the primogenial lands, whereof, perhaps, the
								whole isle consisted before its present desolation. The elevated
								plain seems to have been the crater of the volcano; the conic hills
								were probably thrown up by the cinders and ashes. The ridge of slags
								is the stream of lava, and some of it ran probably towards the sea.
								The elevated hummocks in the plain, are the masses of slags and
								lava, such as they remained after the action of the volcano ceased.
								They have gradually decayed, and this, together with the foreign
								matters, washed down by violent rains from the hills of ashes and
								cinders, have contributed to fill the crater up, and make its
								surface level. It seems therefore to follow, that Ascension was
								originally a land or island; but, when the volcano was formed in its
								bosom, part of it was entirely changed and destroyed, and now shews
								nothing but nature in ruins:</p><p n="214"><q><emph>------ nec restat in illa, Quod repetas; tantum cinis, &amp;
										sine semine terra est. Corn. Severus.2</emph></q></p><p n="215">St. Helena has on its outside, especially where the ships lye at
								anchor, an appearance, if possible, more dreadful and dreary than
								Ascension; but the farther you advance, the less desolate the
								country appears; and the most interior parts are always covered with
								plants, trees, and verdure: however there are every where the most
								evident marks, of its having undergone a great and total change from
								a volcano and earthquake, which perhaps sunk the greatest part of it
								in the sea.</p><p n="216">Easter-Island, or Waihu, is another island of the same nature. All
								its rocks are black, burnt, and honey-combed: some have perfectly
								the appearance of slags; nay, even the soil, which is but thinly
								spread over the burnt rocks, has the appearance of a dark yellow
								ochre. We found a great many black glassy stones, scattered among
								the great quantity wherewith the whole isle is covered, which are
								known to mineralogists by the name of Iceland-agate, and are always
								found near volcanos, or places exposed to their violence: thus, for
								instance, they abound in Italy and Sicily, and in Iceland near the
								volcanos, and likewise in Ascension. We found the whole isle very
								poor in vegetables; and, though I walked over a great part of it, I
								found no more than about twenty plants, including those that are
								cultivated, and no trees at all, which is very remarkable in an isle
								of this extent, under so fine a climate, and inhabited for a long
								time past: for, when Roggewein first discovered it in 1722, he even
								then found those stone pillars, which we likewise saw, and which
								seemed to us to have been erected many years ago.3 The writers of
								Roggewein's voyage saw likewise woods on this isle; it should
								therefore seem, that since that time, some disaster had befallen
								this spot, and ruined the woods, and thrown down many of the huge
								stone pillars, for we found several on the ground. Perhaps this
								happened in 1746, when Lima and Callao suffered so much by an
								earthquake; nor is it uncommon for earthquakes to extend their power
								a great way. Capt. Davis, in the year 1687, being 450 leagues from
								the main of America, felt an earthquake very strongly, when at the
								same time its most violent effects were observed at Lima and
								Callao.</p><p n="217">But I will, by no means, insist upon the circumstance, that the isle
								was full of woods and forests in Roggewein's time, upon the mere
								authority of these writers, as a corroborative proof of any changes,
								which I suppose this isle to have undergone; for one of these
								writers at least seems to contradict his own report, by telling us,
								that the man who came on board, had a canoe made of small pieces,
								none of which was above half a foot in length; which we found really
								true, and is very natural, because they have no wood: but unluckily,
								upon the whole, the history of the giants twelve feet high, deprived
								him entirely of the character of a faithful historian. And, besides
								this, we found the figures or stone pillars, all made of a porous
								tufa, which had undergone a violent operation by fire. These pillars
								were already existing in Roggewein's time; consequently the isle,
								its stones, and strata, had already undergone the violence of fire;
								so that it evidently appears, that whatever changes the island has
								undergone, must have been anterior to Roggewein's arrival there in
								1722. However, it was obvious to every one, that the isle had been
								subject to the violence of a volcano, which had perhaps destroyed a
								part of it.</p><p n="218">But the tropical isles in the South-Seas bear likewise the most
								undeniable marks of violent changes from fire and earthquakes;
								though their present cultivated state, the fine mould covering their
								surface, and the various vegetables on it, partly hide the vestiges
								of these revolutions, and require therefore the eye of a man used to
								these enquiries, and acquainted with nature in its various states.
								The excavated tops of the peaks of Maiatea, Bola-Bola, and Mourua,
								the spires and shattered rocks of the interior parts of Te-Arraboo,
								or the little peninsula of O-Taheitee, together with the
								honey-combed black rocks and lava of Tobreonoo and the Marquesas,
								are such proofs of these revolutions, as nobody will dispute, who is
								well acquainted with the subject, and has formerly examined the
								neighbourhood of volcanos, Nay, all the New-Hebrides, the Marquesas,
								and Society-Isles, together with the Azores or Western-Isles in the
								Atlantic, have all more or less, the same marks of those great
								changes, which they have undergone in former ages. But if we
								remember, that earthquakes and subterraneous fires have in all ages
								raised isles from the depth of the ocean; if we read the accounts of
								the origin of Therasia and Hiera, or Santerini and Volcanello, of
								the two Kamenis, of an isle between Tercera and St. Michael; if we
								compare the strata and structure of these new isles, and of some in
								the Atlantic, and the South-Seas; if we recollect, that some of
								these isles have still volcanos, and that others are still subject
								to earthquakes; we cannot help suspecting, that these isles might
								probably have had the same origin, by being raised from the bottom
								of the ocean by a fire, or, as I may call it, a sub-marine volcano.
								The O-Taheiteans and inhabitants of the Society Isles seem to be
								very well acquainted with earthquakes. Their mythology acknowledges
								a God, called O-Maoowe, whom they think to be the God and Creator of
								the sun, and who in his anger shakes the earth, and causes
								earthquakes; which they express by the phrase O-Maoowe toorore te
								whennoa (i.e.) Maoowe shakes the earth; which certainly seems to me
								to prove, that they are not quite strangers to this tremendous
								phaenomenon.4</p><p n="219">I must not assert that the foregoing observations, make it certain
								that these isles were raised by earthquakes and fire; but I think
								the opinion probable; nor do I imagine that all the high isles, were
								thus thrown up by fire and earthquakes, from the bottom of the sea.
								Many of them may have existed before, nay, they have perhaps
								constituted greater lands, and were only dismembered by the sinking
								of the intermediate parts: and as we have already once entered into
								the land of fables and mythology, I must beg leave to return again
								to it. The natives of the Society Isles, pretend their isles were
								produced when O-Maoowe dragged a great land from West to East
								through the ocean, which they still imagine to be situated to the
								Eastward of their islands: all that time they say, their isles were
								broken off as little fragments, and left in the midst of the ocean.
								This tradition seems to indicate, that the inhabitants themselves
								have some idea of a great revolution, which happened to their isles.
								The god of earthquakes, mentioned before, proves, that they some how
								refer the present condition of their isles, to a great earthquake as
								a general cause: and the great land they remember, and of which
								their isles are fragments, seems to imply, that they have not
								forgotten that their habitations formerly were parts of a great
								continent, destroyed by earthquakes, and a violent flood, which the
								dragging of the land through the sea seems to indicate.</p></div></div><div type="chapter" n="5" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head><l>CHAPTER V</l><l>Remarks on the Organic Bodies</l><l><q><emph>omnis natura vult esse conservatrix sui, ut &amp;

									them inhabited by a numerous race, in a higher state of
									civilization than any of their neighbours;4 we enter a country
									improved by art, and from the rough walks of uncultivated
									nature, pass into the lovely variety of a flourishing and well
									kept garden; the ground is no longer loaded with heaps of putrid
									branches and leaves, that give nourishment to briars, climbers,
									ferns, and the whole tribe of parasite plants; but a bed of
									grasses adorns the whole surface, and forms that luxuriant sod,
									which is always the effect of cultivation. The fruit trees rise
									at proper distances from each other, and the shade which their
									foliage throws, shelters the green turf below, which the rays of
									a tropical sun would otherwise soon scorch and destroy.5 The
									dwellings of the natives have the same advantage, being
									generally situated in the midst of a group of trees, and
									frequently surrounded with various shrubs. The first range of
									hills that rise within the plains are entirely destitute of
									trees, by which means, the sun having full scope to operate,
									permits no grasses or other tender plants to grow there, so that
									the whole is covered with a very dry kind of fern, among which,
									two sorts of shrubs are dispersed that can equally support the
									utmost fury of a vertical sun.</p><p n="224">As we advance higher, we find the sides of the hills beginning to
									be wooded, and at last arrive at the highest summits, which are
									wholly covered with forests of very tall trees. As these tops
									are frequently involved in clouds, the temperature of the air is
									very mild, and causes all kinds of vegetables to thrive with
									luxuriance. Among the rest, mosses, ferns, epidendra, and the
									like, which particularly delight in moisture, cover the trunks
									and branches of the trees, and over-run the ground.</p></div><div type="subsection"><head>Marquesas</head><p n="225">To the North Eastward of the Society Isles, lie those islands
									which Mendanna named the Marquesas de Mendoza. They might be
									aptly compared to the Society Isles, if these last were
									destitute of reefs and of plains. The Marquesas are also more
									wooded, though the variety of plants is not, by far, so great,
									owing to the room which the plantations take up in the woods
									themselves.</p></div><div type="subsection"><head>Friendly Isles</head><p n="226">Next to the Society Isles for richness of productions, and beauty
									of appearance, we must place that group discovered by the Dutch
									navigator Taesman, and not unaptly to be distinguished by the
									name of Friendly Isles, from the peaceable, kind disposition of
									their inhabitants. They are raised so high above the level of
									the sea, that they can no longer rank with the Low Islands; and
									being destitute of mountains, they are equally distinct from the
									High Islands. They are extremely populous, their uniform surface
									therefore, gives the people an opportunity of carrying
									cultivation very far; and from one end to the other, they are
									intersected by paths and fences, which divide the plantations.
									At first one might be apt to think that this high cultivation,
									would give the botanist very scanty supplies of spontaneous
									plants; but it is the peculiar beauty of all these elegant isles
									to join the useful to the agreeable in nature, by which means a
									variety of different wild species thrive among those that are
									cultivated, in that pleasing disorder which is so much admired
									in the gardens of this kingdom.</p></div><div type="subsection"><head>New Hebrides</head><p n="227">The more Western isles named the New Hebrides, appear with a very
									different vegetation. They are high and mountainous, without
									plains or reefs, though their hills have gentle slopes, and
									their valleys are extensive: they are fertile, and almost
									totally covered with forests, in which, the plantations of the
									natives, are so many insulated spots, especially as the number
									of inhabitants is but small for the size of the isles. The
									spontaneous plants therefore, occupying the greatest space, the
									variety of species is also greater here, than in the more
									Easterly islands.</p></div><div type="subsection"><head>New Caledonia</head><p n="228">The arid soil of New Caledonia, totally distinct from all others
									in the South Sea, produces nevertheless, a variety of plants,
									most of which form genera very distinct from those before known.
									A reef of coral rocks surrounds the shores here at a
									considerable distance, in the same manner as at the Society
									Isles, and the only cultivated parts of the country, are
									likewise some narrow plains. But it seems, that though the
									natives bestow great labour on them, yet they barely yield them
									a scanty subsistance, which probably, is the cause of their very
									inconsiderable number. From the unanimous testimony of several
									gentlemen, who made the voyage in the Endeavour Bark, as well as
									this last in the Resolution, we have the greatest reason to
									assert, that the productions of this large island, (the plains
									excepted) entirely resemble those of the coasts of New Holland,
									which are not far distant.6</p></div><div type="subsection"><head>New Zeeland</head><p n="229">New Zeeland, which lies in the temperate zone, presents a very
									different aspect from any of the tropical countries. Its
									northern isle though mountainous, like the other, has however
									very extensive slopes, which the natives have known how to turn
									to advantage by culture; but as we never landed on that part, we
									shall confine ourselves to the Southern isle, at each of whose
									extremities we touched. The prospect here consists of several
									ranges of mountains, one higher than another, the highest capt
									with snow: their sides are steep, their valleys narrow, and the
									whole covered with immense forests. The only difference between
									the Northern and Southern ends of the isle, consists in this,
									that the latter still degenerates into ruder rocks; whilst the
									former in some places has level spots, clear of wood, and
									covered with grasses, rushes, &amp;c. The climate of this isle
									is so temperate, that all sorts of European garden plants (which
									we had sown) vegetated very luxuriantly in the midst of winter:
									the indigenous Flora is therefore very prolific, and the variety
									of genera and new species considerable: but as the country has
									probably, never since its first existence, undergone any changes
									from the hand of industry: its forests are perfect labyrinths,
									which innumerable climbers, briars, and shrubberies, twining
									together, render almost wholly impenetrable, whilst they in
									great measure prevent every herbaceous plant from coming up:
									these last therefore, are only found on the beaches, along the
									edge of the valley, and are almost entirely composed of
									antiscorbutics and pot-herbs.</p></div><div type="subsection"><head>tierra del fuego</head><p n="230">Still, as we advance to the South, the appearance of countries
									becomes more and more barren. Tierra del Fuego, at the South
									extremity of America, always labours under the rigors of cold,
									and all its Western coasts are barren, rocky mountains, whose
									tops are continually covered with snow. In a bay where we
									anchored to the North-West of Cape Horn, we found scarce any
									traces of vegetation, except on some low little isles, whose
									thin turf, which covered the rock, was quite marshy; and in the
									lowest bottoms of vallies, or the crevices of mountains, where
									some ill-shaped, wretched shrubberies were to be found, scarce
									ever growing to such a height, as to deserve the name of trees.
									All the higher parts of the mountains are black rocks, perfectly
									naked. In the small catalogue of plants, we however find the
									celery, which Providence has distributed to universally, as one
									of the best remedies against the scurvy. The North-East side of
									Tierra del Fuego, slopes into a kind of plain, and looks more
									rich in vegetables; but we did not land upon it.</p></div><div type="subsection"><head>New Georgia</head><p n="231">When we saw the barren side of Tierra del Fuego, we had scarce an
									idea of a more wretched country existing; but after standing
									sometime to the Eastward, we met with the isle of New-Georgia,
									which, though in the same latitude, appeared so much more
									dreadful, that before we came close up with it, it was suspected
									to be an island of ice. The shapes of its mountains are,
									perhaps, the most ragged and pointed on the globe; they are
									covered with loads of snow in the height of summer, almost to
									the water's edge; whilst here and there, the sun shining on
									points, which project into the sea, leaves them naked, and shews
									them craggy, black and disgustful. We landed in Possession-Bay,
									and found the whole Flora to consist of two species of plants,
									one a new plant*<ref target="#jf80"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf80">* Ancistrum. Foster's Nova Genera Plantarum, p. 3, 4.</note></ref> peculiar to the Southern hemisphere, the other
									a well-known grass; both which, by their starved appearance and
									low stature, denoted the wretchedness of the country.</p><p n="232">However, as if nature meant to convince us of her power of
									producing something still more wretched, we found land about
									four degrees to the Southward of this, apparently higher than
									it, absolutely covered with ice and snow (some detached rocks
									excepted) and in all probability incapable of producing a single
									plant. Wrapt in almost continual fogs, we could only now and
									then have a sight of it, and that only of its lowest part, an
									immense volume of clouds constantly resting on the summits of
									the mountains, as though the sight of all its horrors would be
									too tremendous for mortal eyes to behold. The mind indeed, still
									shudders at the idea, and eagerly turns from so disgusting an
									object.</p></div><div type="subsection"><head>I. NUMBER of SPECIES</head><p n="233">From whas has been said, it appears, that the rigorous frost in
									the antartic regions almost precludes the germination of plants;
									that the countries in the temperate zones, being chiefly
									uncultivated, produce a variety of plants, which only want the
									assistance of art to confine them within proper bounds; and
									lastly, that the tropical isles derive a luxuriance of
									vegetation from the advantage of climate and culture. But the
									number of vegetables is likewise commonly proportioned to the
									extent of the country. Continents have therefore, at all times,
									been remarkable for their immense botanical treasures; and,
									among the rest, that of New-Holland, so lately examined by
									Messrs. Banks and Solander, rewarded their labors so
									plentifully, that one of its harbors obtained a name suitable to
									this circumstance (Botany Bay). Islands only produce a greater
									or less number of species, as their circumference is more or
									less extensive. In this point of view, I think both New-Zeeland
									and the tropical isles rich in vegetable productions. It would
									be difficult to determine the number in the first with any
									degree of precision, from the little opportunities we had of
									examining its riches: our acquisitions of new species from
									thence amount to 120 and upwards; the known ones, recorded
									already in the works of Linnaeus, are only six, and consequently
									bear a trifling proportion to the new ones; but there is great
									reason to suppose that, including both the isles of New-Zeeland,
									a Flora of no less than 400 or 500 species, on a careful
									scrutiny, might be collected together; especially if the
									botanist should come at a more advanced season than the
									beginning of spring, or not so late as the beginning of winter;
									at which times we had the only opportunities of visiting this
									country.</p><p n="234">In the tropical isles, the proportion of new and known species is
									very different. All our acquisitions of new ones from them
									amount to about 220 species; and the collection of the known or
									Linnaean, to 110, which gives the whole number 330; and shews,
									that one third were well known before. Cultivation contributes
									not a little towards this, because it probably contains such
									plants, as the first settlers of these isles brought with them
									from their original East-Indian seats, which of course are most
									likely to be known; and, with these cultivated ones, it is to be
									supposed there might come the seeds of many wild ones, also of
									East-Indian growth, and consequently known to the botanists. The
									new plants, therefore, can only be those which originally grew,
									peculiar to these countries, and such as have escaped the
									vigilance of the Europeans in India.</p><p n="235">The number of individual species (330) which we found in the
									tropical isles, (old and new) is by no means to be considered as
									a perfect Flora, for which purpose, our opportunities of
									botanizing were greatly insufficient. On the contrary, I am
									rather inclined to think, that our number might almost be
									doubled on a more accurate search, which must be the work of
									years, not of a few days, as was the case with us. The greatest
									expectations are from the New-Hebrides, as they are large,
									uncultivated, but very fertile islands. The jealous disposition
									of their natives would not permit us to make many discoveries
									there; yet, from the out-skirts of the country, we might form a
									judgment of the interior parts. As an instance, that we often
									have had indications of new plants, though we could never meet
									with the plants themselves, I shall only mention the wild nutmeg
									of the isle of Tanna, of which we obtained several fruits,
									without ever being able to find the tree. The first we met with
									was in the craw of a pigeon, which we had shot, (of that sort,
									which, according to Rumphius,7 disseminates the true nutmegs in
									the East-India islands): it was still surrounded by a membrane
									of bright red, which was its mace; its color was the same as
									that of the true nutmeg, but its shape more oblong; its taste
									was strongly aromatic and pungent, but it had no smell. The
									natives afterwards brought us some of them. Quiros must have
									meant this wild nut, when he enumerates nutmegs among the
									products of his Tierra del Espirit- Santo.8 This circumstance
									gives a strong proof (with many more of another nature) of the
									veracity of this famous navigator; and, as he likewise mentions
									silver, ebony, pepper, and cinnamon among the productions of
									Tierra del Espirit- Santo, and the isles in the neighbourhood, I
									am inclined to believe, that they are really to be met with
									there.</p><p n="236">Another material obstacle to our compleating the Flora of the
									South-Seas, and which indeed is connected with the former,
									arises from the changes of seasons: for though, between the
									tropics, they be not strongly marked with the alternatives of
									heat and cold, yet, according to the approach or recess of the
									sun, vegetation is more or less active. This we experienced, by
									touching at some of the isles, two different times, after an
									interval of seven months. The first was in August (1773) or the
									height of the dry season; when we found every thing wearing a
									yellowish or exhausted colour; many trees had shed their leaves,
									and few plants were in flower. The second time, being in April
									(1774), soon after the rainy, or at the beginning of the dry
									season, we were surprized beyond measure by the lively hues
									which now appeared in those very objects, that had seemed as it
									were dead at our first visit: we found many plants which we have
									never seen before; observed many others in flower, and every
									thing covered with a thick foliage of a fresh and vivid green:
									and from this circumstance, and the longer time we spent at the
									Society Isles, our collections from thence are the most perfect.
									It is true, the difference of dry and rainy seasons is not so
									strongly marked as on continents, or in isles contiguous to
									them; especially as fruits of all kinds chiefly ripen during the
									wet months, which would be impossible, were the rains constant;
									and secondly, since even the dry months are not wholly exempted
									from showers: but the relative distinction holds
									notwithstanding, as the proportion of rain in one, is
									considerably greater than in another.</p><p n="237">It is owing to the exceeding small size of the low isles, that
									their vegetable productions are so inconsiderable; though I must
									confess, we never landed on any one without meeting with
									something new. Savage-Isle, which is in fact no more than a low
									island, raised several feet above water, and clearly manifests
									its origin, by the bare coral rocks of which it consists, has
									some new plants, which, in the out-skirts of the isle, grew in
									the cavities of the coral without any the least soil. We might
									have made several acquisitions on this island, but the savage
									disposition of the natives forced us to abandon it.9 As a
									contrast to the tropical isles, we ought to mention
									Easter-Island, which lies so little without the tropic, that is
									may well be classed with those isles which are actually included
									in it. This isle is either grossly misrepresented by the Dutch
									discoverers, or has since then been almost totally ruined.10 Its
									wretched soil, loaded with innumerable stones, furnishes a Flora
									of only 20 species; among these, ten are cultivated; not one
									grows to a tree, and almost all are low, shrivelled and dry. In
									the opposite, or Westernmost part of the South-Sea, lies a small
									isle, which has obtained the name of Norfolk-Island: almost its
									whole vegetation corresponds with that of New-Zeeland, whose
									North end is not far distant from it; only some allowances must
									be made for the greater mildness of the climate, which gives
									every plant a greater luxuriance of growth. Peculiar to this
									isle, and to the Eastern end of Caledonia we found a species of
									coniferous tree, from the cones probably seeming to be a
									cypress: it grows here to a great size, and is very heavy but
									useful timber.</p></div><div type="subsection"><head>II. STATIONS</head><p n="238">As the South-sea is bounded on one side by America, on the other
									by Asia, the plants, which grow in its isles, partly resemble
									those of the two continents; and the nearer they are either to
									the one or the other, the more the vegetation partakes of it.
									Thus the Easternmost isles contain a greater number of American,
									than of Indian plants; and again, as we advance farther to the
									West, the resemblance with India becomes more strongly
									discernible. There are, however, singular exceptions to this
									general rule: thus, for instance, we find the gardenia and morus
									papyrifera, both East-Indian plants, only in the Easterly
									groupes of the Friendly and Society Isles; the Tacca of Rumph,
									which is likewise an Indian species, is only found in the
									Society Isles.11 On the other hand, some American species do not
									appear till we reach the Western Isles, called the Hebrides,
									which are however the farthest removed from that continent. Part
									of these exceptions are perhaps owing to the inhabitants, who,
									being of a more civilized nature in the Easterly isles, have
									brought several parts with them from India, for cultivation,
									which the others have neglected. The same circumstance also,
									accounts for the arrival of the spontaneous Indian species in
									these Easternmost isles; they being probably, as I have already
									observed, brought among the seeds of the cultivated sorts. In
									confirmation of which, it may be alledged, that the Indian
									species are commonly found on the plains in the Society Isles,
									and the spontaneous American species on the mountains.</p><p n="239">A few plants are common to all the climates of the South Sea;
									among these is chiefly the celery, and a species of scurvy grass
									(Arabis) both which are generally found in the low islands
									between the tropics, on the beaches of New Zeeland, and on the
									burnt islands of Tierra del Fuego. Several other species seem to
									have obviated the differences in the climate by a higher or
									lower situation: a plant, for instance, which occupies the
									highest summits of the mountains at O-TaheitŠe, (or any of the
									Society Isles) and grows only as a shrub, in New Zeeland is
									found in the valley, and forms a tree of considerable height;
									nay the difference is sensible in different parts of New Zeeland
									itself: thus a fine shrubby tree at Dusky Bay or the Southern
									extremity, which there grows in the lowest part of the country,
									dwindles to a small inconsiderable shrub at Queen Charlotte's
									Sound, or the Northern end, where it is only seen on the highest
									mountains. A similarity of situation and climate sometimes
									produces a similarity of vegetation, and this is the reason why
									the cold mountains of Tierra del Fuego produce several plants,
									which in Europe are the inhabitants of Lapland, the Pyrenees,
									and the Alps.</p></div><div type="subsection"><head>III. VARIETY</head><p n="240">The difference of soil and climate, causes more varieties in the
									tropical plants of the Southern isles, than in any other.
									Nothing is more common in the tropical isles, than two, three,
									four, or more varieties of the same plant, of which, the
									extremes sometimes, might have formed new species, if we had not
									known the intermediate ones, which connected them, and plainly
									shewed the gradation. In all these circumstances, I have always
									found that the parts most subject to variation, were the leaves,
									hairs, and number of flower stalks, (pedunculi) and that the
									shape and whole contents of the flower (partes fructificationis)
									were always the most constant. This however, like all other
									rules, is not without exceptions, and varieties arising from
									soil sometimes cause differences even there, but they are too
									slight to be noticed. A cold climate, or a high exposure shrinks
									a tree into a shrub, and vice versa. A sandy or rocky ground
									produces succulent leaves, and gives them to plants, which, in a
									rich soil have them thin and flaccid. A plant which is perfectly
									hairy in a dry soil, loses all its roughness, when it is found
									in a moister situation: and this frequently causes the
									difference between varieties of the same species in the Friendly
									Isles, and in the hills of the Society Isles: for the former,
									not being very high, are less moist than the hills of the
									latter, which are frequently covered with mists and clouds.</p></div><div type="subsection"><head>IV. CULTIVATION</head><p n="241">That cultivation causes great varieties in plants, has been
									observed long since, and can no where be better seen than in the
									tropical South Sea isles, where the bread-fruit tree (artocarpus
									communis) alone, has four or five varieties; and the
									Dracaenaterminalis Linn. two; the Tacca, in its cultivated
									state, has quite a different appearance from the wild one, and
									the plantane, or musa paradisiaca, varies almost in infinitum
									like our apple. The vegetable kingdom furnishes the natives of
									the tropical lands in the South Sea, with the greatest part of
									their food, their clothing, their dwelling, furniture, and every
									convenience. In New Zeeland, the natives live chiefly on fish,
									and the spontaneous plants furnish them with vestments, so that
									they care not (especially in the Southern island) to have
									recourse to agriculture. The plant of which they make all their
									clothing, fishing lines, cords, &amp;c. is a new genus, which we
									have called Phormium, and properly belongs to the natural order
									of the coronariae, which it closely connects with the ensatae or
									flags. But in the tropical isles, where the climate softens what
									is savage in human nature, and as I may say naturally leads to
									the civilization of mankind, the people are fond of variety of
									food, of conveniencies at home, and of neatness and ornament in
									dress; hence it happens that they cultivate (one island with
									another) almost fifty different species, besides making use of
									several that are spontaneous. The little trouble which
									agriculture is attended with, and the great advantages which
									arise from it in the Society and Friendly Isles, are the reasons
									why the number of plants cultivated in those isles, so much
									exceeds those of the others. In the more Westerly isles of the
									New Hebrides, the country being very woody every where, it
									became a more difficult task to till the ground; for this
									reason, only some of the most necessary plants are selected
									there for cultivation, and we find the manners of the people,
									more unpolished, and savage. New Caledonia seems to be but a
									refractory soil, and therefore the few inhabitants on it, can
									barely procure a subsistence at the expence of much toil and
									labour.</p></div><div type="subsection"><head>V. CLASSES and SEXES</head><p n="242">It is observation of a very remote date, that cultivation often
									takes from plants the power of propagating by seed: this is
									clearly seen in most of the plantations of the isles, and more
									especially in the bread-fruit tree, where the seeds are
									shrivelled up, and lost as it were, in a great quantity of
									farinaceous pulp;*<ref target="#jf81"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf81">* Mr. Sonnerat found in the Philippines likewise the bread-fruit tree wild, and as this plant had there not undergone so many changes from cultivation, it bears ripe seeds, of a considerable size, which he had delineated and engraved.</note></ref> in the same manner it also happens in the
									plantane, which sometimes hardly preserves the rudiments of
									seeds.=<ref target="#jf82"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf82">= Mr. Banks, it is said, met with one kind of the musa wild in New Holland, which there bore and perfected its seeds.</note></ref> The O-Taheitee apple, which contains a hard capsula,
									commonly has no seeds in the loculaments or divisions; the
									gardenia, hibiscus and rosa sinensis almost constantly bring
									flowers where the number of petals is multiplied, and neither of
									them have seed. But the cloth tree or morus papyrisera, is the
									most extraordinary of all, inasmuch as it never blossoms in
									these isles; the reason is obvious, for the natives never suffer
									it to grow till the time of flowering comes on, as the bark
									would then be unfit for their purpose. The great fertility and
									exuberance of the soil in some of the tropical isles, is perhaps
									one of the reasons why such a number of their plants belong to
									the Linnaean classes of monoecia, dioecia, and polygamia, and it
									is remarkable that plants which bontanists have observed to be
									hermaphrodites in America, here bear their male and female
									flowers on two distinct shrubs, and this may confirm the
									opinion, that most dioicous plants, are somewhere or other also
									found in the hermaphrodite state; which, if it were general,
									would entirely set aside that class: it has likewise often been
									thought that it would be an improvement to the sexual system, if
									the classes of monoecia and polygamia were expunged, and their
									genera placed according to the number of stamina; but, if we
									consider how many of them would fall to the share of such
									classes as are already numerous, it must be obvious, that this
									would only render the science more intricate. The number of
									five, according to the great Linnaeus's observation, is the most
									frequent in nature, (Phil. Bot. 60). Hence the class of
									pentandria is so crowded with genera; and hence also our
									acquisitions chiefly belong to it. It was with a kind of regret,
									that we saw so many plants accumulating to the increase of that
									class, which was already too extensive; as this circumstance
									seemed to hasten the overthrow of the sexual system, it
									contributed to make us extremely cautious in creating new
									genera. Those classes, which in Europe are the most copious, the
									umbellated, the Syngenesia, the Papilionaceae, the Bicornes, the
									Siliquosae, the Personatae, and the Verticillatae, have very few
									congeners in the tropical isles; the beautiful classes of
									Ensatae, Coronariae, Sarmentaceae, are equally rare. The grasses
									are not numerous, and are chiefly of the class of Polygamia. The
									Piperitae, Scitamineae, Hesperideae, Luridae, Contortae,
									Columniserae, and Tricoccae, chiefly compose the Flora of these
									isles. Among the Orchideae, a great variety of Epidendra inhabit
									the uncultivated parts. Most of them are new, and their flowers
									so very various, that they could be distinguished into several
									different genera, with the same ease that botanists have
									separated the Convolvulus and Ipomaea, or the Nyclanthes and
									Jasminum, only from slight differences in the formation of the
									flower. The species of Convolvuli are very copious in the
									South-Sea isles, and so closely connected with each other, that
									it becomes very difficult to determine them. The genus of
									peppers (piper) has been placed among the diandria by Linnaeaus;
									though he has taken the greatest part of its species upon the
									authority of Plumier. We had opportunities of examining many
									species of it, and always found the number of stamina irregular
									and indeterminate, and the shape and number of stigmata
									different in almost every species: it is therefore but just,
									that this genus should be restored to the class Gynandria, where
									it properly belongs, and with which its fructification perfectly
									agrees. But, allowing, even that some species of pepper
									regularly have two stamina to each germen, this cannot be
									sufficient to remove them out of the class; since we see the
									Arum seguinum, macrorhizon, and esculentum, the Dracontium, and
									the Pothos, which have all either four, six, or seven stamina
									regularly round each germen, still continue in the class
									Gynandria Polyandria.</p><p n="243">This is an abstract of the observations, which we were able to
									make on the classification of plants, and of the classes which
									are chiefly found in the isles of the South-Sea. I shall only
									add, concerning the descriptions or definitions of the known
									species in Linnaeus, that we have found them, in general, very
									exact in the American plants, but more inaccurate in those of
									the East-Indies; a circumstance, which I can only attribute to
									the following cause: The American plants have had the good
									fortune to be examined and described in their native soil, by
									the most expert botanists of the present age; the late favourite
									disciple of Linnaeus, Peter Loefling; the great and consummate
									observer, Jacquin; Dr. P. Browne; Mr. Jussieu, &amp;c.12 On the
									contrary, the Indian plants are chiefly known from herbals, and
									the more inaccurate, unfaithful, and unscientific accounts of
									the botanists of the last age; for we can hardly expect much
									from the few opportunities, which the disciples of the great
									father of botany have had, of snatching up a few plants, as they
									have been chiefly confined to the voyage to China; during which
									they seldom go ashore, and much less make any stay in places,
									which are worthy the attention of the curious observer. And this
									circumstance likewise shews, how much that immense part of our
									globe, India, with its isles, wants the labours of a new,
									accurate, and modern observer, accompanied by a faithful
									draughtsman, used to drawings of natural history, in order to
									make us better acquainted with the rich treasures of these
									extensive regions; and it raises a wish in each patriotic
									breast, that, as the British empire in India is so extensive, so
									much respected, and its subjects there so wealthy and powerful,
									that some of them would engage men capable of searching the
									treasures of nature, and examining the several objects of
									sciences and arts in these climates.</p><p n="244">Before I conclude this article, I shall only add a word or two on
									the received opinion, that sea-weeds are certain indications of
									land. I shall not need to mention the immense beds of weed,
									which are annually found in the midst of the Atlantic ocean, to
									disprove this assertion, since I can have recourse to an ocean
									infinitely broader, namely, the South-Sea in the temperate zone,
									which is at least 1500 leagues broad from New-Zeeland to
									America, in which space, we are now well assured, there is no
									land, though we saw from time to time bunches of weeds in every
									part of it. Indeed, nothing is so probable, as that some weeds
									never take root, but grow floating on the water, as other
									aquatic plants do. But, supposing this were not the case,
									nothing is more easily to be conceived, than that the almost
									constant strong Westerly winds in that part, may detach these
									weeds, and carry them over all the ocean. If this last
									circumstance were well ascertained, it is most likely, that the
									weeds once torn up, begin from that time to decay, and a kind of
									random-guess of the vicinity of land, might be formed upon the
									bare inspection of the state of the weeds.</p></div></div><div type="chapter" n="19" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head><l>SECTION II</l><l>Animal Kingdom</l></head><p n="245">THE countries of the South Sea, and the Southern coasts, contain a
								considerable variety of animals, though they are confined to a few
								classes only. We have seen by what degrees nature descended from the
								gay enamel1 of the plains of the Society Isles, to the horrid
								barrenness of the Southern Sandwich Land. In the same manner the
								animal world, from being beautiful, rich, enchanting, between the
								tropics; falls into deformity, poverty, and disgustfulness in the
								Southern coasts. We cannot help being in raptures, when we tread the
								paths of O-Taheitean groves, which at each step strike us with the
								most simple, and at the same time the most beautiful prospects of
								rural life; presenting scenes of happiness and affluence to our
								eyes, among a people, which, from our narrow prejudices we are too
								readily accustomed to call savage. Herds of swine are seen on every
								side; by every hut dogs lie stretched out at their ease, and the
								cock with his seraglio, struts about, displaying his gay plumage, or
								perches on the fruit trees to rest. An unintermitted chorus of small
								birds warbles on the branches all the day long, and from time to
								time, the pigeons cooe is heard with the same pleasure as in our
								woods. On the sea shore, the natives are employed in dragging the
								net, and taking a variety of beautiful fish, whose dying colours
								change every moment: or they pick some shells from the reefs, which,
								though well known to the naturalist, yet have a right to the
								philosopher's attention, who admires the wonderful elegance of
								nature alike, in her most common as in her rarest productions. To
								enhance the satisfaction we feel, this happy country is free from
								all noxious and troublesome insects; no wasps, nor mosquitoes,
								infest the inhabitants, as in other tropical countries; no beasts of
								prey, nor poisonous reptiles ever disturb their tranquility.*<ref target="#jf83"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf83">* The common flies are, indeed, at some seasons troublesome, on account of their immense numbers, but they cannot be called noxious insects: the only disagreeable animals in O-Taheitee is the common black rat, which is very numerous there, and often does mischief by its voracity.</note></ref></p><p n="246">Let us remove from hence to the temperate zone: what a falling off
								from the soft scenes of domestic quiet, to the wilds of New-Zeeland!
								The rocky mountains, the forests, yea, human nature itself, all look
								savage and forbidding. The animal creation are already less happy
								than between the tropics, and hawks and owls, the tyrants of the
								wood, prey upon the weak and defenceless: still however the whole
								country rings with continual songs, of which the sweetness, emulates
								that of our first songsters. But as we advance to the South, and
								cross an immense ocean, in the midst of which we see some lonely
								birds, skimming the waves, and collecting an uncertain sustenance;
								we arrive at the South-end of America, and view a barren coast,
								inhabited by the last and most miserable of men, and but scantily
								clad with low and crooked shrubs: we find a number of vultures,
								eagles, and hawks, always hovering about, upon the watch for prey:
								and lastly, we observe that the greatest part of the other birds
								live gregarious in a few spots; whilst the rocks are occupied by a
								race of seals, which in comparison with the rest of animals, seem
								monstrous and misshapen.2</p><p n="247">The classes of birds and fishes, are the only numerous ones in the
								countries which we have visited: those of quadrupeds and insects are
								confined to an exceeding small number of well known species. Those
								of cetacea, amphibia and vermes, are likewise not numerous, and the
								two first especially contain scarce anything new.</p><p n="248">quadrupeds</p><p n="249">In the tropical isles they have but four species of quadrupeds, two
								of which are domestic; and the remaining ones are the vampyre and
								the common rat. This last inhabits the Marquesas, Society-Isles,
								Friendly-Isles, and the New-Hebrides; it is also found at
								New-Zeeland; but whether it may not have been transported thither by
								our ships is uncertain; at New-Caledonia, however, it has never been
								seen. Rats are in incredible numbers, at the Society-Isles, and
								especially at O-Taheitee, where they live upon the scraps of meals,
								which the natives leave in their huts, upon the flowers and pods of
								the erythrina corallodendron, upon plantanes and other fruits, and
								for want of these, on all sorts of excrements; nay, they are
								sometimes so bold, as to be said to attach the toes of the
								inhabitants whilst they are asleep. They are much scarcer at the
								Marquesas and Friendly-Isles, and seldom seen at the
								New-Hebrides.</p><p n="250">The vampyre (vespertilio vampyrus) which is the largest known species
								of bat, is only seen in the more Western isles. At the
								Friendly-Isles they live gregarious by several hundreds, and some of
								them are seen flying about the whole day: I found a large
								casuarina-tree, hung with at least 500 of them in various attitudes,
								some by the hind and others by the fore-feet. They live chiefly on
								fruits: they skim the water with wonderful ease, and though we saw
								one swimming, I think this single fact, gives me no right to
								pronounce them expert swimmers. It is known that they frequent the
								water, in order to wash themselves from any filthiness or to get rid
								of vermin which might accidentally stick to them. Their smell is
								somewhat offensive. When irritated they bite hard, but are for the
								rest quite inoffensive. In Tanna there are, besides these larger
								bats, myriads of a minute species, which we saw and heard, but never
								could obtain for examination. At New-Caledonia the natives use the
								hair of the great bats in ropes and in the tassels to their clubs;
								and they interweave it among the threads of the grass (cyperus
								squarrosus), which is made use of for that purpose.</p><p n="251">The two domestic quadrupeds are the hog and the dog.3 The
								Society-Isles alone are fortunate enough to possess them both:
								New-Zeeland and the low islands must be content with dogs alone; the
								Marquesas, Friendly-Isles, and New-Hebrides have only hogs; and
								Easter-Island and New-Caledonia are destitute of both. The hogs are
								of that breed which we call the Chinese, having a short body, short
								legs, belly hanging down almost to the ground, the ears erect, and
								very few thin hairs on the body: their meat is the most juicy, and
								their fat the most agreeable and the least cloying I ever tasted,
								which can only be attributed to the excellent food they are used to;
								consisting chiefly of the bread-fruit or its sour paste, yams,
								eddoes, &amp;c. They are very numerous at the Society-Isles, where
								you hardly pass a house that is without them, and frequently meet
								with some that keep a great number. There is likewise abundance of
								them at the Marquesas and a considerable number at Amsterdam, one of
								the Friendly-Isles; but they are more rare at the Western-isles of
								the New-Hebrides. The dogs of the South Sea isles are of a singular
								race: they most resemble the common cur, but have a prodigious large
								head, remarkably little eyes, prick-ears, long hair and a short
								bushy tail. They are chiefly fed with fruit at the Society Isles;
								but in the low isles and New Zeeland, where they are the only
								domestic animals, they live upon fish. They are exceedingly stupid,
								and seldom or never bark, only howl now and then; have the sense of
								smelling in a very low degree, and are lazy beyond measure: they are
								kept by the natives chiefly for the sake of their flesh, of which
								they are very fond, preferring it to pork; they also make use of
								their hair, in various ornaments, especially to fringe their breast
								plates in the Society Isles, and to face or even line the whole
								garment at New Zeeland.</p><p n="252">Besides the dog, New-Zeeland boasts four other quadrupeds, one is the
								rat, the other a small bat, resembling that described in Mr.
								Pennant's4 Synopsis of Quadrupeds, No. 283, under the name of
								New-York bat; the third is the sea-bear, or ursine seal, Penn. Syn.
								Quad. No. 27 (Phoca ursina. Linn.) and the fourth, the animal which
								Lord Anson calls a Sea-lion, (Phoca leonina. Linn. leonine seal,
								P.S.Q. No. 272).5 Some sailors on board the Resolution, affirmed
								they had seen a little quadruped at Dusky Bay, in New-Zeeland, of
								the shape of a fox or jackal; but as we never on our frequent
								excursions in the woods, met with any thing of this kind, nor have,
								on the most careful enquiry, found that any gentleman who had
								visited New-Zeeland in the Endeavour, had ever seen such an animal,
								we are of opinion, (especially considering the transient manner in
								which, and the time when this was seen, being in the dawn of the
								morning) that it must have been a mistake. As the Southern coasts
								which we saw, have both these seals, and another cogeneric animal,
								besides the seal with a mane, (Phoca jubata) all in greater number,
								and size, I shall now mention them together. It is an observation of
								the great naturalist M. de Buffon, that the large animals in the
								creation, are all to be considered as so many genera (espŠces
								isol‚es) to which we can refer no other species; and to prove the
								truth of this, he mentions the instances of the elephant,
								rhinoceros, tapir, hippopotamus, and giraffe, which are really so
								many genera, to which only one species belongs: and adds likewise
								the cabiai, the beaver, and the lion.</p><p n="253">We shall mention a circumstance making against his assertion: the
								species of seals in the antartic hemisphere, are as large as most
								quadrupeds on the globe, except the elephant and rhinoceros. But two
								of them, which undoubtedly are distinct species, can hardly be
								defined, unless by the colour and mensural difference. One of these
								is the ursine seal, the other the jubated seal. This last is
								mentioned, and described by the great zoologist, the late M.
								Steller,6 in his account of the animals of Beering's isles, near
								Kamtchatka: there is also a tolerably good account of this animal in
								Don Pernetty's voyage to the Malouines or Falkland Isles: they both
								call it the sea lion; a name given to it with the greatest justice,
								as its anteriors bear a great resemblance to the lion, which its
								shaggy mane and tawny colour helps to strengthen, while Lord Anson's
								sea lion with its wrinkled nose, has not the least similarity with
								it.</p><p n="254">As there is not one animal entirely new, among the eight quadrupeds
								of the South Sea, it may seem to indicate that this class is already
								more compleat than is generally supposed; but what we have already
								observed in regard to plants, holds good equally in the animal
								kingdom: for never were small islands known to abound with a great
								variety of quadrupeds. It is from the interior parts of Africa,
								India, and perhaps too of New-Holland, that we must expect those
								supplies to the science, whenever the munificence of princes shall
								enable the naturalists, ever ready to undergo fatigue and hardships,
								for the sake of discovery, to search the hidden treasures of those
								vast continents.</p><p n="255">cetacea</p><p n="256">The cetaceous animals which we saw in the South Sea, are the fin
								fish, (Balaena physalis, Linn.) the bottle nosed whale, the grampus,
								the porpesse, and the dolphin of the antients. The two last are seen
								all over the ocean from the line to the antarctic polar circle. We
								had no opportunity of examining any but a female of the dolphin,
								(Delphinus Delphis, Linn.) which we found perfectly to answer to the
								accurate descriptions of the various zoologists. It was struck with
								the harpoon, and we feasted on it with as much, or perhaps more
								appetite, than they did in the time of Dr. Caius. (See Mr. Pennant's
								British Zoology, vol. 3. p. 63. edit. in 4to.)</p><p n="257">birds</p><p n="258">The birds of the South Sea, and of Tierra del Fuego, are numerous,
								and form a considerable variety of species; among which are two
								genera entirely new, and a third hitherto confounded with several
								others (the pinguin). They live secure in every bush, and on every
								tree, undisturbed for the greatest part by the inhabitants; they
								enliven the woods with their continual songs, and contribute much to
								the splender of nature by their varied plumage. It is a received
								notion that birds of many colours do not sing well, but not to
								mention the common goldfinch, which is perhaps, one of the most
								beautiful birds in nature, and has a very melodious note, we have
								numerous instances here to the contrary. The wild forests of New
								Zeeland, and the cultivated groves of O-Taheitee, resound alike with
								the harmony of the shining songsters. There is only one tame species
								of birds, properly speaking, in the tropical isles of the South Sea,
								viz. the common cock and hen; they are found numerous at Easter
								Island, where they are the only domestic animals: they are likewise
								in great plenty at the Society Isles, and Friendly Isles, at which
								last they are of a prodigious size: they are also not uncommon at
								the Marquesas, Hebrides, and New-Caledonia; but the low isles, and
								those of the temperate zone, are quite destitute of them. We can
								hardly reckon certain parroquets and pigeons among domestic birds;
								for though the natives of the Friendly and Society Isles, sometimes
								catch and tame them, yet they never have any breeds of them. The
								number of our new birds from New-Zeeland, is thirty-seven; that of
								the tropical isles, is forty-seven; the species from the ocean, the
								Southern extremities of America and the Southern lands, are upwards
								of twenty. The whole number thus amounts to 104; of which one half
								are aquatic: we have besides these, met with about thirty Linnaean
								species, of which above twenty are aquatic; and I am well persuaded
								that we have not been able to procure every species in the same
								manner, as we have not obtained a compleat Flora of every country we
								visited; the number of new birds therefore is astonishing, when
								compared to that of the known system, and must prove what great
								expectations are to be formed of those continents, which have not
								hitherto been much examined. The aquatic genera are, as we have
								already observed, very numerous, and among them we have the same
								remark to make which we have already made on the plants, namely that
								the most copious genera have still received the greatest additions.
								To the genus of Anas we have added nine new species, to that of the
								Pelecanus five, and to the Procellariae twelve. In the same manner
								among the land birds, we have seven new parrots, six pigeons, and
								eight fly-catchers.</p><p n="259">amphibia</p><p n="260">The few amphibia which we met with in the South Sea, are confined to
								the tropical countries; they are, 1st. the caret turtle which gives
								the tortoise-shell proper for manufacture, (testudo imbricata Linn.)
								2d, the green turtle, (testudo midas) which is fit for eating; 3d.
								the common lizard, (lacerta agilis, Linn.) 4th. the gecko, (lacerta
								gecko) 5th. the amphibious snake, (coluber laticaudatus, Linn.) and
								6th: the anguis platura, Linn. among which, none is poisonous.</p><p n="261">fishes</p><p n="262">The South Sea is rich in fish, and has a great variety of species;
								for though no branch of natural productions, was attended with more
								difficulties in the collection to us, not only from our very short
								stay in many places, but likewise because we were obliged almost
								wholly to depend upon the natives of the several countries, for this
								article, there being no expert fisher-men on board; yet the sea in
								various places yielded us the number of seventy-four species unknown
								heretofore; besides about forty which are described in the System of
								Nature of the celebrated Linnaeus. Among them we have only made one
								new genus, which till now has lain latent among the chaetodontes,
								but ought justly to be separated from them. The accurate observer,
								Prof. Forskal, whose premature death in Arabia, every lover of
								science must sincerely lament, had the same idea, though I knew
								nothing of it, as his book was not published till after my return to
								Europe; he calls the new genus acanthurus, and I gave it the name of
								harpurus.7 The greatest part of the fish in the South Sea are very
								good eating, many of them are delicious, and would do honour to a
								Roman feast; only a few of the branchiostegous are noxious, of which
								we felt the fatal effects, as I shall mention in the sequel. M. de
								Buffon has observed, that nature seems to please herself in casting
								several beings very nearly in the same mould, as if certain
								conformations were more easy to her than others; he might have
								added, perhaps, with great propriety, because such conformations are
								most useful and necessary in the whole system of organic bodies.
								Hence we have found that certain classes of plants are remarkably
								copious, likewise, that the most extensive genera of birds, have
								still received a greater number of new species; and that in the
								fishes also, the rich genera of gadus blennius, sparus and perca,
								are most enlarged in the same manner; we may at the same time, I
								think, with the greatest probability suppose, that the unknown
								treasures in this last class are still immense; first, from the
								great additions which it has been in our power to make, though we
								laboured under the difficulties aforementioned: and secondly, from
								the more imperfect state of the definitions, which, according to the
								best method extant, must still depend upon the very precarious
								number of rays in the fins.</p><p n="263">insects</p><p n="264">No countries in the world produce fewer species of insects than those
								of the South-Sea: it is surprizing how very few we met with, and
								those of the most common and well-known sorts. The only place where
								we saw them rather more abundant, was in New-Caledonia, and this I
								suspect is owing to its proximity to New-Holland; but our short stay
								there did not allow us to make the least acquisition in this branch.
								The most numerous sorts are undoubtedly the crustaceous; but, among
								them, we saw none that were not well marked in the Linnaean system.
								Here I must also remark, that there is a small species of scorpion
								in the tropical isles of the South-Sea, but more common to the
								Westernmost than the Society Isles, where I never saw one. The
								native, who was with us eight months, told us they were harmless;
								however, they were armed exactly as their cogeneric species. It is
								therefore reserved for future enquiry, to determine by what
								accidental circumstances the virus of the scorpion's sting becomes
								more or less deleterious; especially as the experiments made by Mr.
								de Maupertuis seem to intimate, that even the individuals of the
								same species are not all equally poisonous; and that one and the
								same individual is, at different times, more or less dangerous.
								Academie des Sciences, 17.8</p><p n="265">shells, and other vermes</p><p n="266">THE shells of the South-Sea are far less various than might at first
								be expected; and the reefs of the tropical isles generally yielded
								the most common Linnaean shells, such as cowries, episcopal mitres,
								murices tritonis, the most common buccina, turbines, and neritae. A
								few species at New-Zeeland, are new, though the greatest part of
								them are minute. In regard to the mollusca, what little discoveries
								we made, are confined to the Atlantic ocean; and of the remaining
								orders we no where found any thing new.</p><p n="267">I. NUMBER</p><p n="268">The whole number of species in the greater classes of animals, viz.
								quadrupeds, cetacea, amphibia, birds, and fish, which we saw in the
								South-Sea, according to the above enumeration, amounts to between
								260 and 270, of which about one third are well known. Let us allow,
								that this number comprehends two thirds of the animals of those
								classes, actually residing in the South-Sea, though we have reason
								to think, that the fauna is much more extensive, we shall have
								upwards of 400; and supposing the classes of insects and vermes to
								give only 150 species, the whole fauna of the South-Sea isles will
								consist of at least 550 species, a prodigious number indeed, when
								compared with that of the Flora.</p><p n="269">II. STATION</p><p n="270">Though many of the birds in New-Zeeland are remarkable for the gay
								colors of their plumage; yet we found, when we came to
								Norfolk-Island, (which, as I have observed in my account of the
								plants, contains exactly the same species) that the same birds
								appeared there arrayed in far more vivid and burning tints, which
								must prove, that the climate has a considerable influence on
								colours. There is also a species of king-fisher common to all the
								South-Sea isles, of which the tropical varieties are much brighter
								than that of New-Zeeland. The plumage of birds is likewise adapted
								to the climate in another respect; for those of warm countries have
								a moderate covering, whilst those of the cold parts of the world,
								and such especially, as are continually skimming over the sea, have
								an immense quantity of feathers, each of which is double; and the
								pinguins, which almost constantly live in the water, have their
								short, oblong feathers lying as close above each other as the scales
								of fishes, being at the same time furnished with a thick coat of
								fat, by which they are enabled to resist the cold: the case is the
								same with the seals, the geese, and all other Southern aquatic
								animals. The land birds, both within and without the tropics, build
								their nests in trees, except only the common quail, which lives in
								New-Zeeland, and has all the manners of the European one. Of the
								water-fowl, some make their nests on the ground, such as the
								grallae, which breed only in pairs; whilst several species of shags,
								(pelecani) live gregarious in trees, and others in crevices of
								rocks; and some petrels (procellariae) by thousands together, burrow
								in holes under-ground close by each other, where they educate their
								young, and to which they retire every night. The most prolific
								species in the South Sea, are the ducks, which hatch several eggs at
								one brood, and though the shags, penguins, and petrels, do not hatch
								more than one or two, or at most three eggs at a time, yet by being
								never disturbed, and always keeping together in great flocks, they
								are become the most frequent and numerous. The most palatable
								species of fish are likewise the most prolific; but it must be
								observed, that there is no where such abundance of fish in the
								South-Sea, as at New-Zeeland, by which means they are become the
								principal nourishment of the natives, who have found that way of
								living to be attended with the least trouble, and consequently
								suited to that indolent disposition which they have in common with
								all barbarous nations.</p><p n="271">III. VARIETY</p><p n="272">It does not appear, that the individuals of the animal kingdom are so
								much subject to variety in the South-Seas, as those of the
								vegetable. Domestication, the great cause of degeneracy in so many
								of our animals, in the first place, is here confined to three
								species; the hog, dog, and cock: and secondly, it is in fact next to
								a state of nature in these isles: the hogs and the fowls run about
								at their ease the greatest part of the day; the last especially,
								which live entirely on what they pick up, without being regularly
								fed. The dog being here merely kept to be eaten, is not obliged to
								undergo the slavery, to which the varieties of that species are
								forced to submit in our polished countries; he lies at his ease all
								the day long, is fed at certain times, and nothing more is required
								of him: he is therefore not altered from his state of nature in the
								least; if probably inferior in all the sensitive faculties to any
								wild dog; (which may perhaps be owing to his food) and certainly, in
								no degree, partakes of the sagacity and quick perception of our
								refined variety. Among the wild birds, the varieties are very few:
								two species of pigeons, two of parrots, one of king-fishers, and one
								or two of fly-catchers, are the only I know of, that vary any thing
								in different isles; and it is much to be doubted, with regard to
								some of them, whether what we count varieties are not either
								distinct species, or only different sexes of one and the same;
								circumstances, which it is well known, require a long series of
								observations, not to be made on a cursory view. The varieties in
								other classes are still less considerable.</p><p n="273">IV. CLASSIFICATION</p><p n="274">The animals of the South-Seas, as we have already observed, are most
								of them new species. The known ones between the tropics, are chiefly
								such as are generally found all over the maritime parts of the
								torrid zone; those of the temperate zone being principally aquatic,
								are common to those latitudes in every sea; or consist of European
								species. Upon the whole, we found no more than two genera, which are
								distinct from those already known, and all the remaining species
								rank under old genera. But it is not possible to refer those to the
								two continents of Asia and America, as was done with the plants;
								because there are so very few genera, which are not common to both
								of them. We shall therefore, at present, confine our observations on
								the classes of animals, to the Southern aquatic birds, and the new
								genus of fish, which we established. The genus of petrels, which
								contains only six species according to Linnaeus's last system, has
								received an addition of twelve new species from the Southern seas.
								The largest of them is the bird, which the Spaniards call the
								Quebrantahuessos, or osprey-petrel; the least is the common
								stormfinch, (Procellaria pelagica) which is seen alike in the North
								sea and in the South sea, and in almost every latitude. Mr. de
								Brisson, whom Mr. de Buffon justly censures for multiplying species,
								and subdividing genera, has divided the few known species into two
								genera, from some slight difference in the bill, which is not even
								worth remarking here. At the same time, M. Scopoli, with as little
								propriety, unites the diomedea or albatros, with the procellariae;
								and hath been led to this method of classing, by a real species of
								the last genus; which, upon what foundation I cannot imagine, he
								mistakes for the bird Linnaeus calls a diomedea.9 There are but two
								circumstances which have occasioned the errors of the various
								naturalists; the one, that they attached themselves too much to the
								investigation of individual species, without every now and then
								stopping to take a view of the general chain of nature; and, to this
								we must ascribe the many mistakes in subdividing, or combining
								genera; the other, that, by continually fixing on the general view
								of the whole extent of nature, they forget to descend to the
								particulars of classification, which the imperfect state of the
								science requires. It is from keeping a just medium between these
								extremes, that the illustrious Linnaeus has acquired so great a fame
								in the literary world, and methodized all the productions of nature
								with such judgment, that future ages will ever own him as the father
								of the science. It is from falling into the first error, that some
								untravelled naturalists load their books with the enumeration of
								varieties, instead of species. On the other hand, the great
								zoologist, and most elegant writer of this and many other ages, M.
								de Buffon, wholly solicitous to view his subject in all its
								grandeur, makes light of exposing here and there a neglect.
								After-ages may bring the science nearer to perfection, by combining
								what is valuable on both sides. Great as the loss of Linnaeus must
								certainly be to science, it will not be so severely felt, whilst we
								have so enlightened botanists, as Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, and
								such acute zoologists as M. de Buffon and Professor Pallas. The
								genus of pinguins Mr. Pennant set in its proper light, after it had
								lain lost, as it were, among the genera of diomedea and phaeton,
								which are utter strangers to it. Mr. Pennant's Magellanic pinguin,
								the two misplaced Linnaean species, and our three new species, have
								increased it considerably. The bill, though various in regard to
								thickness, has, however, the same character in them all, except that
								some species have the lower mandible truncated; the nostrils are
								always linear apertures, which further proves their distinction from
								the diomedea. The feet are exactly of the same shape in them all.
								They have only the rudiments of wings, enlarged by a membrane into a
								fin, and covered with a kind of feathers, but so closely, that they
								seem like scales. It is this, besides the shape of bill and feet,
								which distinguishes the genus of auks or murrs (alcae) from them;
								for these last, though sometimes incapable of flying, are only so on
								account of the shortness, not the deficiency of quills. The body of
								the pinguins is entirely covered with oblong, thick, hard, and
								glossy plumes, which form a coat of mail, impenetrable to wet,
								because they are obliged to live almost continually in the sea. They
								are confined to the temperate and frigid zones, at least I know of
								none between the tropics. The genus of pelicans (pelecanus) might
								perhaps be separated into three genera with greater justice, than
								authors have used in many of their dilacerations. The true pelican
								(onocrotalus) is greatly different from all the rest of the species:
								the man of war (p. aquilus); the gannet (p. bassanus); and the
								several sorts of boobies (p. sula, fiber &amp; piscator,) form
								another division; from which the cormorant and shag (p. carbo &amp;
								graculus) and four new species, are again widely different. But the
								characters of the feet, and the naked skin in which the eyes are
								situated, being common to them all, they may still be continued in
								one common genus. The gannets and boobies, though they frequent
								particular places for breeding, are however, not gregarious as the
								sorts of shags: some of these last build in vast numbers on the same
								tree; others sit by thousands in the cavities of overhanging cliffs
								along the seashore, and again, another fort build their elevated
								nests on the ground, by whole myriads.</p><p n="275">Among the fish we have only separated a genus from the chaetodon,
								which differs from it by having no scales on the fins, a spine on
								each side of the tail, and a different number of branchiostegous
								rays. Of this genus which has obtained the name of Harpurus, there
								are seven species, viz. three new ones, (4, the ch. nigricans,) (5,
								lineatus) (6, fasciatus of Linnaeus) and 7, one described by
								Hasselquist, and erroneously quoted for the ch. nigricans by
								Linnaeus. We have augmented the Linnaean genus of sciaena, with
								eight new species, which have every one the same generic characters,
								so that this genus now stands more firmly among the rest, to which
								it is related. The genera of labrus and sparus merit the utmost
								attention of the naturalists, since every writer gives us different,
								and often contradictory characteristics of them, which may be seen
								by comparing the definitions of Linnaeus, (Syst. Nat. xii.) Gouan,
								(genera piscium) Brunniche, (icthyolog massiliens.) Pallas,
								(spicileg. zool.) and Forskal, (Faun. Aegypt. arab.) some of which
								are certainly found from the examination of a few species only.</p><p n="276">I shall now briefly mention the use which is made of the various
								animal productions in the South Sea isles.10 The animal kingdom has
								at all times furnished mankind with a variety of necessaries,
								conveniencies, and luxuries; the first step towards the civilization
								of nations, is the adoption of such things as serve to make life
								more easy and comfortable; and the first consequence of a civilized
								state, is the introduction of such articles as captivate the various
								senses, and flatter the appetites. Hence in the South Sea we find
								the natives of the Society Isles in the highest state of
								civilization; they possess the comforts and even luxuries of life:
								the more Westerly nations lose the luxuries, and retain only the
								conveniences: the New-Zeelanders more savage, have even these in an
								inferior degree; and the wretched inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego,
								can hardly be said to have more than the bare necessaries of life,
								and therefore, of all our brethren, approach the nearest to
								brutes.11 Almost every species of fish is eaten at the tropical
								isles, and generally looked upon by the inhabitants as a dainty,
								which they prefer to pork and dog's flesh. Their birds, on the
								contrary, are seldom taken for the sake of any thing else than the
								feathers, (excepting the domestic fowls and wild ducks) of which,
								they make a variety of ornaments, and upon which, as real luxuries,
								they set a very high value: nay, so far are they from eating all
								birds, that they have a kind of superstitious regard for herons and
								king-fishers, almost like that which is paid to the stork, the robin
								red-breast, the swallow, and other familiar harmless birds in
								England. The natives of the Society Isles, have their immense
								helmets and targets covered with the shining plumes of a pigeon, and
								edged round with a vast number of the long white tail feathers of
								the tropic-bird: but what they value as much as diamonds and pearls
								are esteemed in Europe, are the crimson feathers of certain
								parroquets, of which, they make tassels to ornament the warriors. We
								accidentally procured a quantity of these feathers at Amsterdam, one
								of the Friendly Isles, where they fastened them on pieces of their
								stuffs.12 These being carried to O-Taheitee, and shared out in
								little pieces, procured us a great number of hogs; for a bit of two
								inches square, covered with feathers, would at any time, be eagerly
								purchased with a hog. The rest of the tropical islanders make a
								variety of ornaments of birds feathers, such as crested caps; at
								Easter Isle, and the Marquesas, fly-flaps, &amp;c. The hair of the
								dog is employed in fringing their targets at O-Taheitee, and nothing
								is more common than vast bunches of human hair tied round the knees,
								ancles, &amp;c. among the natives of the Marquesas. The Easter
								Islanders make an ornament hanging on the breast of the porposse's
								bone, the O-Taheiteans make saws and various utensils of bone,
								shark's teeth, &amp;c. The tails of the sting ray (raja pastinaca)
								are universally employed to arm the spears of the natives; the
								Mallicolese point their arrows with bone; and the inhabitants of
								Tierra del Fuego have fish gigs armed with jagged bones. A variety
								of shells are also made use of in the tropical isles, some are
								eaten, some make necklaces, some bracelets and fish hooks, others
								weights to sink their fishing lines, and they wear some mishapen
								pearls in their ears. Not even the coral is without its use, for it
								is employed to smooth and polish the surface of their canoes. The
								New-Zeelanders living continually on fish, are glad when they can
								get a dog or bird to eat, which with them, always is reckoned a
								dainty. They employ the skins of dogs for their cloaths, but merely
								for convenience, namely, to keep them warm: their ornaments are
								however, a comb of the bone of some cetaceous animal, which is stuck
								in the hair; and feathers of gulls, parrots, &amp;c. the first they
								wear on their head, the last on their battle axes; lastly, they have
								some ornaments which are taken from the mineral kingdom. Among the
								tropical isles, the natives dress all their meat over the fire, with
								as much cleanliness and nicety as we could do it ourselves, so that
								the delicate appearance of their victuals often tempted us to yield
								to their invitations, which their hospitable disposition never
								failed to express in the most engaging manner. At New-Zeeland too,
								the inhabitants though less hospitable, and more uncleanly, yet
								dress their fish with so much care, that a man with a good appetite
								would not refuse to eat with them. But the people of Tierra del
								Fuego are not only miserable in their appearance, being scarce
								covered with a bit of seal's skin, but they are likewise highly
								disgustful in the manner of taking their food, which consists of raw
								seals flesh, almost putrid, and of which the rank fat is to their
								taste the most delicious part: in other places where seals are more
								scarce, they derive their subsistence from the muscle-shells, which
								are common on the rocks. We found vast refreshment from the animals
								in the various countries we met with, and only in a few instances
								suffered by eating some species of fish. The one of these was a
								Sparus, of which three were caught at Mallicollo, the largest about
								fifteen inches long: about sixteen persons eat of these three fish,
								and found themselves affected with a prodigious numbness, which soon
								made them quite giddy, and incapable of standing; they had
								afterwards excruciating pains in all their bones, which did not go
								off till ten days afterwards, by the continual use of vomits, and
								sudorifics.13 A hog that eat part of the entrails, swelled
								prodigiously, and died a few hours after: several dogs also which
								eat of the offal, lay for a fortnight in the greatest agonies,
								howling and foaming at the mouth, utterly incapable of standing on
								their legs. A little favourite parroquet, which eat a bit of the
								fish, likewise died in consequence of it. Sometime afterwards, I was
								told that a fish of the same species was caught at Tanna by some of
								the sailors, who salted it and eat it, without any ill effects; from
								whence it is to be supposed that this species is not poisonous in
								itself, but only from the food which it accidently meets with, in
								the same manner as many fish in the West Indies, otherwise very
								wholesome to eat, are said to become deleterious, by feeding on the
								manchineel apples. The other sort was a new species of tetrodon,
								whose ugly appearance along might have prejudiced us against it, had
								we been any ways nice; but so much is the value of fresh provisions
								enhanced by being long at sea, that we were glad of even this
								opportunity of eating an ill-looking animal. Only three of us eat a
								very small bit of the liver, not above two or three morsels each at
								supper; before two o'clock the next morning, we were all up,
								complaining of the effects of the poison, which operated exactly as
								that of the sparus had done before: we immediately took vomits, and
								having evacuated all we had eaten, escaped with a giddiness, lasting
								only a few days, without any of the acute pain experienced in the
								other instance. Another hog then on board, unfortunately tasting the
								entrails, swelled as the other had done and died: sometime after,
								another tetrodon of the same species, was caught, and being opened,
								one of the dogs eat a small quantity of the entrails, and lived in
								the most dreadful agonies for a fortnight after, so that he was at
								length thrown over board as incurable. The sparus seems to have been
								mentioned by Quiros, under the name of pargos, which he says at one
								time poisoned great part of his ship's company. The tetrodon again
								is related closely to the Tetrodon ocellatus, which in Japan is
								commonly made use of in cases of self-destruction, and the virus of
								which is enhanced by the Ilicium anisatum, an otherwise salutary
								plant. (See Kaempfer Hist. Japon.)</p><p n="277">It remains now that I should say something on the animals, which are
								looked on as signs of the approach of land: and I ought here to add,
								that the sight of birds is not more to be depended on, than that of
								sea-weeds, unless we are well assured that the birds we see, are
								land birds, or never range to any distance from land; a circumstance
								not easily ascertained. Seals, pinguins, petrels, and albatrosses,
								are seen six or seven hundred leagues from land, in the very middle
								of the South Sea, so that they cannot be depended on. Between the
								tropics, men of war birds are seen a hundred leagues from land, and
								as the isles of the South Sea there, are much nearer together, they
								cannot be looked upon as signs of land. Boobies and shags do not
								wander so far; and the last, commonly not out of sight of land; but
								one knows not how far accident may sometimes carry them.</p><p n="278">These are the few remarks on animals which occured to me, during the

								and best-cultivated islands of the Pacific Ocean.2 The high hills of
								this happy country are without inhabitants; and, if we except some
								fertile well-watered vallies, containing a few cottages, in the
								midst of the mountains, the whole interior country is still
								unimproved, and such as it came out of the hands of nature. The flat
								grounds, surrounding the island towards the sea, contain chiefly the
								habitations of the natives; and nothing can be seen more beautiful,
								more cultivated, and more fertile, than these extensive plains. The
								whole ground is covered with coco-nut and bread-fruit trees, which
								yield the chief subsistence for its inhabitants: all is interspersed
								with plantations of bananas, young mulberry-trees for the
								manufacture of their cloth, and other useful plants; such as yams,
								eddoes, sugar-canes, and many others too tedious to enumerate. Under
								the shade of these agreeable groves, we every where beheld numerous
								houses, which we should have considered as mere sheds, were they not
								sufficient to screen the owners from rain, moisture, and the
								inclemencies of the air, which is always mild and temperate in these
								happy regions. All the houses are filled with people, and the
								largest habitations contain several families. Wherever we walked, we
								found the roads lined with natives, and not one of the houses was
								empty, though we had left the shores opposite the ship, crowded with
								people. All these circumstances indicate, that there is an
								extraordinary population in this queen of tropical isles; and we
								have every necessary argument to corroborate the assertion.</p><p n="283">The mild and temperate climate, under the powerful, benevolent, and
								congenial influence of the sun, mitigated by alternate sea and land
								breezes, quickens the growth of the vegetable and animal creation;
								and therefore, in some measure also, benefits and improves the human
								frame, by this happy combination. Such is the great abundance of the
								finest fruit growing, as it were, without cultivation, that none are
								distressed for food. The sea is another great resource for the
								inhabitants of this and all the Society Isles. They catch great
								numbers of fine and delicious fish; they collect numberless shells,
								cray-fish, sea-eggs, and several kinds of blubbers, along the reefs,
								both by day and night; and often go to the low islands a few leagues
								off, in quest of cavallas,3 turtles, and water-fowl. There is not a
								house or cottage, about which you do not observe a dog, several
								cocks and hens, and frequently two or three pigs. All this not only
								affords a superfluity, but likewise a great variety of animal and
								vegetable food. The bark of the morus papyrifera, the bread-fruit
								tree, and some others, afford them materials for an easy, light, and
								warm kind of clothing; which they manufacture of various qualities,
								cut into various shapes, and dye with various colours. Food and
								raiment, the two great wants of the human species, are therefore
								easily supplied, and the inhabitants are hither to fortunate enough
								to have none of the artificial wants, which luxury, avarice, and
								ambition have introduced among Europeans.4</p><p n="284">The call of nature is heard at an early age in this genial climate:
								the inhabitants therefore soon begin to chuse an agreeable partner
								for life, happy in the pleasing expectation of seeing themselves
								represented, and as it were reproduced in a numerous offspring.</p><p n="285">These circumstances, when compared with the many wants of our
								civilized state, the labours we must undergo in supplying these
								wants, and especially those which are most indispensible in our
								climates, and the many difficulties preceding and attendant on our
								marriages, will be sufficient to prove, that in the natural course
								of things, population must be great in these happy regions. But this
								reasoning does not give a clear and precise idea of the subject. I
								will therefore attempt to enable the reader to make a near estimate
								of the real population of this and all the adjacent isles.</p><p n="286">When we came the second time to O-Taheitee in April, 1774, we found
								the inhabitants busied in making preparations for a great naval
								expedition against Morea, a district in Eimeo. We saw a fleet of
								their war-canoes collected together, with a great number of small
								craft: we saw the natives preparing the war-canoes in several
								districts, and in some they were already launched; we found them
								exercising their rowers and warriors; and the armaments of two
								districts actually appeared in review before the great chief's
								house, at O-Parre. The district of Atahooroo is one of the greatest,
								and that of Tittahaw one of the smallest. The first had equipped 159
								war-canoes, and about 70 small vessels intended for the chiefs, the
								sick and wounded, and probably to carry some provisions. The second
								district sent 44 war-canoes, and about 20 or 30 smaller ones. That
								part of O-Taheitee, which is called T-Obreonoo, or the great Western
								peninsula, contains 24 districts in all; the lesser Eastern
								peninsula, or Te-Arraboo, is divided into 19. Let us suppose, that
								each district of the first is capable of sending the medium between
								the largest and least number of war-canoes, as mentioned before,
								which would amount to 100: nay, to be more moderate, let us suppose
								each district can send no more than 50 war-canoes, and 25 small
								attending boats; and we shall find the war-canoes of T-Obreonoo to
								amount to 1200, and the small vessels to 600. We observed in the
								large war-canoes 50 persons, including warriors, paddlers, and
								steerers; and in the smaller about 30. (We found, indeed, some
								war-canoes, that required 144 paddlers, eight men to steer, one to
								command the paddlers, and about 30 warriors for the stage; but, as
								there are only one or two vessels of that size in each island, we
								can make no inference from thence.) To be very moderate in our
								computations, we will suppose no more than 20 men in each of these
								war-canoes; and, according to this last supposition, the men
								required to defend and navigate 1200 vessels, will amount to 24,000.
								Each of the small attending boats contained at a medium five men;
								consequently the crews of all the small canoes of the 24 districts,
								at the rate of 25 vessels from each district, form a number of 3000,
								which, added to the complement of the war-canoes, are 27,000 men.
								Let us further suppose each of these men to be married to a woman,
								and to have one child; and in this case, we shall have the number of
								81,000 persons.5 Every one will allow, that this is the very lowest
								computation that can be made, and that the number of living
								inhabitants of T-Obreonoo must be at least double the above number.
								For all the inhabitants are not warriors; nor are all employed in
								navigating the vessels; there remain besides, many old men at home;
								and it is certainly insufficient to allow a single child for every
								married couple; for marriage here is commonly blessed with a
								numerous offspring. I have seen more than one family, wherein there
								were six or eight children. Happai, the father of O-Too, the present
								king of T-Obreonoo, had eight children, seven of whom were still
								alive, when we came to O-Taheitee. Many other families had from
								three to five children. But some will be ready enough to question
								this great population, and to doubt, whether such numbers can find
								food in proportion to support them all: it is but just to establish
								the fact on a firm basis. We have frequently spoken with warmth of
								the extraordinary fertility of these regions; we are likewise able
								to demonstrate the truth of what we have advanced. When we visited
								the Society-Isles, the natives often told us, that three large
								bread-fruit trees were sufficient to feed a full-grown person during
								the bread-fruit season, that is, during eight months. The largest
								bread-fruit trees, with their branches, occupy a space in diameter
								about forty feet; consequently every tree occupies 1600 square feet,
								or if round 12562/3 feet. An English acre contains 43,560 square
								feet; it follows, that above 27 large bread-fruit trees in the first
								case, and 35 in the second, would stand on an acre; and these will
								feed ten persons for the space of eight months in the first case,
								and 12 persons in the second. During the remaining four months of
								the year, the natives live upon the roots of yams and eddoes, the
								banana, and the fruit of the horse-plantanes, of which they have
								immense plantations, in the vallies of the uninhabited mountainous
								part of the isle. They likewise make a kind of sour-paste of the
								bread-fruit by fermentation, which keeps for several months, and is
								both healthy and palatable to those who are once used to its
								acidulated taste. Now let us compare this to the greatest fertility
								in known countries. In France,*<ref target="#jf84"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf84">* Discours sur les Vignes Dijon, 1756, 12mo.</note></ref> on a square league, containing about
								4867 French acres (arpents), no more than 1390 persons can live by
								agriculture, and 2604 by vintage: in the first case, one person
								requires 3 arpents to live upon, and in the latter nearly two
								arpents must be allotted for the subsistence of one individual. In
								O-Taheitee, and the Society-Isles, about ten or twelve persons live
								eight months on one English acre, which contains 43,560 square feet;
								whereas the arpent, containing 51,550 square feet English measure,
								feeds but one person six months in France. This calculation proves,
								that taking such parts, as are best cultivated in both countries,
								the population of O-Taheitee is to that of France, nearly as 17 to
								1. Moreover, let us suppose, that on the whole isle of O-Taheitee,
								there are no more than 40 square English miles of land planted with
								bread-fruit trees, which supposition certainly does not err in
								excess. Each mile consists of 640 acres, and 40 miles must
								accordingly contain 25,600 acres. Ten or twelve men live eight
								months on one acre; consequently thirty or thirty-six men can
								subsist the same time on three acres, and twenty or twenty-four men
								find food during a whole year on three acres; consequently, on the
								whole extent of 25,600 acres, 170,660 persons, according to the
								first supposition, or 204,800 according to the second, can be
								supported yearly. But we have seen above, that only 44,125
								individuals are supposed to exist on O-Taheitee, according to our
								first calculation, which is nearly less by 26,535 persons in the
								first instance, or 60,675 in the second, than the isle can support,
								upon the most moderate calculation. Having thus fairly stated the
								possibility of so great a population, we shall certainly not be
								thought unreasonable in our estimate.</p><p n="287">Te-Arraboo has 19 or 20 districts, and is equally well cultivated and
								populous: for its natives not only withstood the whole power of the
								inhabitants of T-Obreonoo, but even beat their forces and ravaged
								their shores. It might therefore be deemed very little, if at all
								inferior, in power and in numbers: but we will reckon them to be
								only one half of the population of T-Obreonoo; and the number of its
								inhabitants will be 40,500.</p><p n="288">Imeo is a little but well-cultivated isle, subject to the king of
								T-Obreonoo. According to the accounts of the Taheiteans, it opposed
								and beat off the whole force of Te-Arraboo; and the great armaments
								we observed going forward in T-Obreonoo, for the reduction of Im‚o,
								prove that they have no mean idea of their strength; notwithstanding
								this, we shall allow them no more than one fourth of the population
								of T-Obreonoo, i.e. 20,250, which, added to the inhabitants of
								Te-Arraboo 40,500, and of those of T-Obreonoo 81,000, makes the
								number of inhabitants of all O-Taheitee, ) ___________ ) and of
								Im‚o, amount to ) 141,750.</p><p n="289">All these are subject to O-Too, king of T-Obreonoo; for though
								Te-Arraboo has a king of its own, yet that king is a vassal to
								O-Too.6 We conclude therefore, that allowing 150,000 persons for the
								population of O-Taheitee and Im‚o, the computation must be
								considered as very moderate.</p><p n="290">The isles of Huahine, O-Raietea, O-Tah..., Bola-bola, Mourua,
								Tabu-A-Manoo, and MaƒtŠa, are certainly very populous; for we saw
								three of them, and found them all well-cultivated, and equally
								well-peopled; and, as the king of Bola-bola has subdued O-Raietea,
								and O-Tah..., it is highly probable, that his power, and
								consequently the population of Bora-bora and Mourua, must be nearly
								upon a par with that of the two conquered islands. If we allow
								200,000 inhabitants for all these seven isles, the account will by
								no means be exaggerated.</p><p n="291">The five Marquesas are likewise very populous, for the natives
								cultivate and inhabit all the slopes of their hills. Between them,
								and the Society-Isles, are a vast number of low isles full of
								inhabitants.7 To the East and South-East of O-Taheitee are still
								more. We saw about five in the year 1773; and as many, if not more
								in 1774. In the Endeavour several more were discovered; and Capts.
								Wallis and Carteret found many also. We cannot think the allowance
								too great, when we suppose all these islands, and the Marquesas to
								contain 100,000 inhabitants.</p><p n="292">Farther to the West is a cluster of isles, which we call the Friendly
								Isles. Tonga-Tabu the largest of them, is in every part highly
								cultivated; the barren sandy outskirts towards the sea, and the road
								leading through the isle alone excepted, all the rest seems to be
								private property, is fenced in, and inhabited by a numerous,
								industrious and friendly people. E-Aoowe is less in size, nor is it
								wholly cultivated, any more than A-Namocka: nevertheless there are
								great numbers of inhabitants in both. About A-Namocka is a
								collection of small isles, all full of people: and if we consult
								Taesman, we find the same archipelago continued under the name of
								Prince William's Isles. I suppose the inhabitants of all these isles
								amount to about 200,000.</p><p n="293">Still more to the West is that cluster of large islands, to which we
								gave the name of the New Hebrides. These, though far from being so
								populous as the Society and Friendly Isles, yet being infinitely
								larger, contain a considerable number of inhabitants. We found a
								great croud of people on one of them, named Mallicollo, and if we
								may form a judgment from the cultivation in Ambrrym it must be
								equally, if not better inhabited; the isles of Aurora, of Lepers,
								and Whitsuntide, seem to be less populous; Tierra del Espiritu Santo
								is large, and perhaps in proportion to its size, has many
								inhabitants. The isles of Pa-oom, A-Pee, Three-hills, Shepherd,
								Mountague, Hinchinbrook, and Sandwich, are all inhabited, and the
								latter seemed to be very fertile and populous. Irromanga, and Tanna,
								from our own observations, and the isles of Irronan, Immer, and
								Anattom according to the informations we received at Tanna, are full
								of people: all these therefore, together may be supposed to contain
								at least 200,000 inhabitants.</p><p n="294">If we suppose the number of souls in New-Caledonia and its adjacent
								isles to be 50,000, the allowance, it is apprehended, cannot be
								deemed very faulty; for though these parts be not so highly populous
								as some others; an extent of eighty leagues in length, will justify
								the guess we have made concerning its state of population.</p><p n="295">The Southern isle of New-Zeeland has very few inhabitants; but the
								Northernmost, according to the accounts we had from Capt. Cook, and
								from what we saw in some few places, as we passed by, is much better
								peopled, nay, in some spots very populous; therefore allowing
								100,000 souls to both isles, we rather think our estimate to fall
								short of the true population.</p><p n="296">If we take the sum 150,000 O-Tahaitee and Im‚o. of these numbers,
								200,000 Society Isles. we find the whole of 100,000 Marquesas and
								Low Isles. the inhabitants of the 200,000 Friendly Isles. isles in
								the South Sea 200,000 New Hebrides. 50,000 New Caldonia. 100,000 New
								Zeeland. ____________ Amounting to 1,000,000</p><p n="297">The population in Tierra del Fuego is so thin, and they live in so
								small tribes, or rather families, that I can hardly believe they
								exceed in all, two thousand individuals, scattered over a surface of
								land, containing at least, as much as would form the half of
								Ireland.</p><p n="298">This account of the population of the isles we visited, in the South
								Seas, I will now conclude with the two following remarks.</p><p n="299">First, I do not pretend that my estimate of the numbers of the
								inhabitants is perfectly accurate; at best it is but a guess
								approaching as near to truth as the data which we had opportunities
								of collecting would permit; and if upon the whole there is any fault
								in it, it rather consists in having formed too small an estimate, or
								if any particular account should exceed the true number, it must be
								in New Caledonia.</p><p n="300">Secondly, The population of countries encreases in the same
								proportion with civilization and cultivation.8 Not that I believe
								civilization or cultivation to be the true causes of a greater
								population; but they are rather, in my opinion, its effects. As soon
								as the numbers increase in a confined place, viz. an island, to such
								a degree, that its inhabitants are obliged to cultivate some plants
								for their food, because the natural wild productions are no longer
								sufficient, they then devise methods for performing this task in an
								easy and proper manner; they find themselves obliged to obtain from
								others, the feeds and roots, to stipulate among themselves, not to
								destroy each others plantations; to defend them jointly against the
								violence of invaders, and to give each other mutual assistance. Such
								are the beginnings of arts and cultivation, such is the rise of
								civil societies; sooner or later they cause distinctions of rank,
								and the various degrees of power, influence, and wealth, which, more
								or less are observed among mankind. Nay, they often produce a
								material difference in the colour, habits, and forms of the human
								species, of which, we shall now treat more at large.</p></div><div type="chapter" n="21" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head><l>SECTION II</l><l>On the Varieties of the Human Species, relative to
									Colour, Size, Form, Habit, and Natural Turn of Mind in the
									Natives of the South-Sea Isles</l><l><q><emph>[Greek Quote Omitted Here from Page 227 of
											Original]. Strabo lib. 2.1</emph></q></l></head><p n="301">THE varieties of the human species are, as every one knows, very
								numerous. The small size, the tawny colour, the mistrustful temper,
								are as peculiar to the Esquimaux; as the noble and beautiful figure,
								and outline of the body, the fair complexion, and the treacherous
								turn of mind, to the inhabitant of Tcherkassia. The native of
								Senegal is characterised by a timorous disposition, by his jetty
								black skin, and crisped wooly hair. A majestic size, red hair, a
								blue languishing eye, a remarkably fair complexion, and a warlike,
								intrepid, but open and generous temper distinguish the Teutonic
								tribes of the North of Europe, from the rest of mankind. But to
								enumerate all these varieties, requires too much time; and the
								subject has been so fully treated of by others, that it would be
								highly improper to repeat their observations. I will therefore
								confine myself to a sketch of the different varieties peculiar to
								every country we have visited, and then endeavour to enumerate their
								various and probable causes.</p><p n="302">We chiefly observed two great varieties of people in the South Seas;
								the one more fair, well limbed, athletic, of a fine size, and a kind
								benevolent temper; the other, blacker, the hair just beginning to
								become woolly and crisp, the body more slender and low, and their
								temper, if possible more brisk,2 though somewhat mistrustful. The
								first race inhabits O-Taheitee, and the Society Isles, the
								Marquesas, the Friendly Isles, Easter-Island, and New-Zeeland. The
								second race peoples New-Caledonia, Tanna, and the New Hebrides,
								especially Mallicollo. The Pesherais, are not I think, to be ranked
								among the natives of the South Sea, as it is not to be doubted, that
								they originally came to Tierra del Fuego, from the American
								continent. Each of the above two races of men, is again divided into
								several varieties, which form the gradations towards the other race;
								so that we find some of the first race almost as black and slender
								as some of the second; and in this second race are some strong,
								athletic figures, which may almost vie with the first; however, as
								we have many good reasons for comprehending in one tribe all the
								islanders enumerated under the first race; we could not help giving
								to all a general character, from which, on account of the extent and
								compass, wherein these nations are dispersed the outskirts or
								extremes must deviate.</p><p n="303">I. First. O-Taheitee, and the adjacent Society-Isles, no doubt
								contain the most beautiful variety of the first race: but even here
								nature seems to follow that richness, luxuriance, and variety which
								we have observed in its vegetation; it is not confined to a single
								type or model. The common people are most exposed to air and sun;
								they do all kinds of dirty work; they exert their strength in
								agriculture, fishing, paddling, building of houses and canoes; and
								lastly, they are stinted in their food. From these causes, they
								degenerate as it were towards the second race, but always preserve
								some remains of their original type; which, in their chiefs or
								Arees,3 and the better sort of people, appears in its full lustre
								and perfection. The colour of their skin is less tawny than that of
								a Spaniard, and not so coppery as that of an American; it is of a
								lighter tint than the fairest complexion of an inhabitant of the
								East-Indian islands; in a word, it is of a white, tinctured with a
								brownish yellow, however not so strongly mixed, but that on the
								cheek of the fairest of their women, you may easily distinguish a
								spreading blush. From this complexion we find all the intermediate
								hues down to a lively brown, bordering upon the swarthy complexion
								of the second race. Their hair is commonly black, strong, naturally
								falling in the most beautiful ringlets, and shining with the
								perfumed coco-nut-oil. I saw but few with yellowish-brown or sandy
								hair, and often no more than the extremities were yellowish, and the
								roots of a darker brown. A single man in O-Tah... had perfectly red
								hair, a fairer complexion than the rest, and was sprinkled all over
								with freckles. The features of the face are generally regular, soft,
								and beautiful; the nose something broad below; the chin is
								overspread and darkened by a fine beard. The women have an open,
								chearful countenance, a full, bright, and sparkling eye; the face
								more round than oval; the features arranged with uncommon symmetry,
								and heightened and improved by a smile, which beggars all
								description. The rest of the body, above the waist, is well
								proportioned, included in the most beautiful, soft outline, and
								sometimes extremely feminine.4 Many of the Arees and Manahounes are
								of an athletic habit, but always blended with a degree of
								effeminacy. The feet are rather large, and what might by thought out
								of proportion. The common people are likewise in general well-built
								and proportioned, but more active, and with limbs and joints that
								are well knit. The women are in general finely, nay delicately
								shaped. The arms, hands, and fingers of some are so exquisitely
								delicate and beautiful, that they would do honour to a Venus of
								Medicis. Unfortunately the habit of walking barefooted, has
								destroyed that beautiful figure in their legs, which are commonly
								large and rather clumsy. Of the men, the Arees are in general of a
								tall stature. I saw several who exceeded six feet three inches, and
								one man was six feet four inches; nor are the common people always
								confined to a short size. The women are rather of low stature, and
								but few are of a size approaching that of men, though I saw a girl
								six feet high, and others very tall. The natives of these isles are
								generally of a lively, brisk temper, great lovers of mirth and
								laughter, and of an open, easy, benevolent character. Their natural
								levity hinders them from paying a long attention to any one thing.
								You might as well undertake to fix mercury, as to keep their mind
								steady on the same subject. The relaxation of their solids, under a
								powerful sun, causes a great indolence, and an unconquerable
								aversion to any laborious undertaking.5 Those that are in power and
								affluence, generally indulge themselves in eating, and distend the
								frame of their body to its utmost stretch. They are absolutely
								inactive, refuse to take even their victuals, and permit themselves
								to be crammed. The great plenty of good and nourishing food,
								together with the fine climate, the beauty and unreserved behaviour
								of their females, invite them powerfully to the enjoyments and
								pleasures of love. They begin very early to abandon themselves to
								the most libidinous scenes. Their songs, their dances, and dramatic
								performances, breathe a spirit of luxury. They are, for the rest,
								hospitable: the lower sort like to pilfer from foreigners, being too
								powerfully tempted by the sight of new and curious things, which are
								very valuable to them. In their wars, they fight with great bravery
								and valour. In short, their character is as amiable as that of any
								nation, that ever came unimproved out of the hands of nature.</p><p n="304">Secondly. The variety of men, next in beauty to those of the
								Society-Isles, are the inhabitants of the Marquesas. They are in
								general more tawny than the former being situated in the latitude of
								° 57' South, nearer the line than the Society-Isles; and they are
								also more accustomed to go without any covering; their privities
								excepted: both which reasons are sufficient to account for the
								darker hue of their skin. However, there are some few more fair
								among them; and their women, who generally go covered, are almost as
								fair as those in the Society-Isles. Their men are generally
								stout-limbed, but none are so fleshy as those in the last-mentioned
								isles, owing, as I suppose, to their greater activity; for, as a
								very considerable part of them live on the slopes6 and the very
								summits of high hills, where their habitations have much the
								appearance of the ayries of eagles, on the craggy summits of
								inaccessible rocks, they must of course have a slender habit of
								body, from the frequent climbing of these high mountains, and from
								the keen air, which they breathe in regions almost constantly
								involved in clouds. They have black beards and fine hair on their
								heads. Their females and younger people have beautiful, regular
								features, and oval faces; but the grown men lose their
								sprightliness, by the general custom of puncturing closely, all
								their body and faces, in the most strange, but regular manner, in
								scrolls, circles, lines, and chequerwise; which of course destroys
								all the features, and the regularity of lineaments.7 The bodies
								remain, however, fine and proportioned, all the limbs strong and
								muscular, with an agreeable outline. The young people are generally
								most beautiful, and would afford many a fine model for a Ganymede.
								The women have a soft, melting outline, the finest symmetry, and the
								most delicate extremities. Their size runs in general to the middle
								stature of men, and few or none, are what we could call little. They
								appeared to us courteous, civil, and hospitable; had a great deal of
								curiosity, and the same levity, which is the general character of
								tropical nations. But, as our stay among them was short, we cannot
								enter into any more particular detail of their character.</p><p n="305">We made but half an hour's stay at Teoukea, one of the low isles
								between the Marquesas and O-Taheitee; and in this time we observed
								the natives to be of a very tawny colour, common to both sexes. They
								were a stout people, with well-proportioned limbs, and black hair;
								had on the breast, belly, and sometimes on the hands, some figures
								made by puncturing the body; and were of a middling size. They
								received us with kindness; gave us coco-nuts and dogs for nails;
								and, though very numerous and well-armed, did not attempt to insult
								us. I cannot, however, say what they might have done, had we made a
								longer stay, especially as their numbers increased every moment.</p><p n="306">Thirdly. The inhabitants of the Friendly Isles are little inferior,
								if not equal in beauty to those of the Marquesas. Their complexion,
								no doubt, is of a darker hue, than that of the commonalty of the
								natives in the Society-Isles; though, in my opinion, it partakes of
								a lively brown, inclining so far towards the red or copper colour,
								as not to deserve the appellation of swarthy. However, many among
								them, especially the better sort of people, and the greater part of
								their women, approach near to the complexion of O-Taheitean fair
								ones. They are generally of a middling stature, or rather above it;
								and their features regular and manly. The men seldom let their
								beards grow to any length, generally cutting them with two sharp
								shells; their ears are perforated by two holes, through which they
								run a small stick horizontally across. The outlines of their bodies
								are not so beautifully feminine, as those of the chiefs in the
								Society-Isles; but they are compact, well-proportioned, and more
								muscular and expressive; as moderate industry has assigned each
								muscle its place and size, without distorting any part of their
								frame. The stature of their females nearly approaches that of the
								other sex; none are so fat and unwieldy, as many individuals in the
								Society-Isles. Their brown complexion becomes their regular
								features, their roundish faces, and fine, full, and lively eyes.
								Their countenance is overspread with an inexpressible smile; their
								shapes and outlines are elegant, and all their actions accompanied
								with ease and freedom. Among others we observed in the croud, at
								Tonga-Tabu, a young girl of about ten or twelve years, with the most
								regular features, an oval face, and the sweetest countenance; her
								eye was bright, lively, and all soul; her long, black hair hung
								negligently down, and was ornamented with bunches of odoriferous
								flowers; her actions were easy, brisk, and free. She had with her
								five apples, and threw every one of them up into the air, catching
								them again with amazing activity and skill. The character of these
								people is really amiable; their friendly behaviour to us, who were
								utter strangers to them, would have done honour to the most
								civilized nation. We were presented in every house with food, and
								the refreshing liquor contained in the coco-nuts, with a spirit of
								hospitality, which is truly patriarchal. All their actions bespoke a
								noble mind, and a wonderful, charming simplicity of manners. They
								have, however, all the little faults we observed in the
								O-Taheiteans, though not in the same degree. Their utensils,
								weapons, manufactures, agriculture, and music, bespeak their
								inventive genius and elegant taste.</p><p n="307">Fourthly. Next to this nation, we come to a set of men, but few in
								number; for they do not exceed 900 in all, and much inferior in
								every respect to those already-mentioned; I mean the natives of
								Easter-Island. They are of a tawny complexion, rather darker than
								that of the Friendly-Isles: their men have hardly a bit of cloth
								round their reins to cover their privities, but the women have
								commonly more covering. They are of a middle size, between five and
								six feet, of a slender habit of body, having well-proportioned
								limbs, but not the most pleasing features. The women are not quite
								disagreeable, and rather small in proportion. The males are
								punctured almost all over the body, have black hair and thin beards.
								Their ears are perforated by a large aperture, and part of the outer
								rim of the ear is separated from the rest by being cut: in this
								monstrous hole, the natives frequently put a scroll made of a leaf
								of the sugar-cane. They are a friendly, harmless set of people, and
								some of them exercised hospitality in its utmost extent, and
								original purity; but they were also much addicted to thieving. The
								soil is strong and barren, and has extensive plantations of
								potatoes, sugar-canes, bananas, and eddoes; though wood and water
								are very scarce articles in this poor country. The vestiges of
								former plantations on the hills, together with many huge
								stone-pillars, erected near the burying-places, to the memory of
								their deceased chiefs and heroes; some of them 27 feet high, are the
								only remains of the former grandeur and population of this isle;
								while some toys, finely carved, were evident proofs of their
								ingenuity and taste.8</p><p n="308">Fifthly. Far remote from this, and all the other isles in the
								South-Seas, inhabited by the first race of people, we find, near the
								South-West extremity of this spacious ocean, two large isles called
								New-Zeeland, peopled by the same race of men. They are of a tawny
								complexion, still more darkened in their faces by the custom of
								puncturing, or rather carving into them, the most curious and
								regular volutes, which hinder, in some measure, the growth of a
								black and bushy beard. Their size is generally tall, their body
								strong, and formed for fatigue; their limbs proportioned and
								well-knit. The knees, however, are very much enlarged, from the
								constant custom of sitting on their hams in their canoes, and their
								legs turned inwards. The females are generally thin, a few only have
								tolerable features; the rest are ill-favoured, though their shape
								and limbs are not without proportion. Their knees are equally
								enlarged with those of the men; and they are harshly treated by
								their husbands, for whom they are obliged to do all the drudgery, as
								is common in all barbarous nations.*<ref target="#jf85"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf85">* According to Strabo, lib. iii. p. 114, and Tacitus de morib. German. c. 15.10 The ancient inhabitants of Spain, Liguria, Celtica, and Germany, had likewise the barbarous custom of leaving husbandry, and all laborious work to their women, whilst they themselves remained perfectly idle. There are likewise in the percentage, many barbarous nations, who treat their women harshly, and leave all drudgery to them. Upon the river Orenoco, this custom prevails. Gumilla in Orenoco illustrado. The same is observed in California, by Father Venegas, Hist. of California, part i, sect. i. The men among the Eskimaux are extremely indolent, and the women are the greatest drudges upon the face of the earth. Lieut. Curtis, Philos. Trans. vol. lxiv. P. ii. p. 385. In Tcherkassia women cultivate the ground. Chardin. Voy. The Bulgarian women were found to work in the vineyards, by Father Boscowich, Voyage de Constantinople. p. 93 and 164. In Africa, nothing is more common, than that the most laborious part of all work is delegated to women; for this takes place among the Hottentots, according to Kolben's Descr. of the Cape of Good Hope. vol. i. p. 160. and La Caille's Voyage au Cap. de B.E. The women about Sierra Leon were seen hard at work by Keeling, Voy. The nation of the Giagas are described to be most unfeelingly cruel to their women. Lord Kaime's Sketches of the Hist. of Man. p. 187. Mr. Falkner observed of the women among the Puelches, Tehuelhets, and other Patagonian tribes, that their lives are but one continued scene of labour; for, besides nursing and bringing up their children, they are obliged to submit to every species of drudgery. Falkner's Description of Patagonia. p. 125.</note></ref>9 They are hospitable, sincere,
								and generous friends; intrepid and bold warriors; implacable and
								cruel enemies, carrying their thirst of revenge even to such a
								degree of inhumanity, as to feast upon their unfortunate prisoners,
								the wretched victims to a ferocious and uncultured disposition. They
								are generally men of sound understanding, and have taste and genius;
								as proofs of which, may be mentioned, their curious carvings, and
								other manufactures.11</p><p n="309">II. The varieties of men belonging to the second tribe or race of
								people in the South Seas, are all confined within the tropics to its
								most Western parts.</p><p n="310">First, The extensive country of New-Caledonia though near the
								continent of New-Holland, is inhabited by a set of men, who are
								totally different from the slender diminutive natives of that
								country, and in many respects distinguished from all the natives
								belonging to the first tribe, living in the Eastern isles of the
								South Sea. Many of these New-Caledonians are very tall and stout,
								and the rest are not below the common size; but their women, who
								appear here again, under the humiliating and disgracing predicament
								of drudges, are commonly small. They are all of a swarthy colour;
								their hair is crisped, but not very woolly;F<ref target="#jf86"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf86">F As some of my readers, not having seen a variety of nations, may think the distinction between crisped and woolly hair, either improper or insufficient, I must beg leave to observe that the woolly hair of negroes, is not only frizzled and crisped, but likewise that each hair is found to be extremely thin, and proceeding from a root or bulb, remarkably smaller than that observed in other human hair; on this account it is called woolly, and its remarkable thinness probably arises from a too copious perspiration, which carries off likewise many humours, otherwise secreted for the express nutriment and growth of the hair: where this perspiration is not so considerable, it can only crisp and blacken the hair, but not to such a degree as to render it woolly. Perhaps the cause of this difference lies in the greater mildness of the climate, or is founded on the way of living of such a people. For instance, though the natives of Taheitee, the Society Isles, Marquesas, and the Friendly Isles, dwell in the same latitude with the New Hebrides, yet they have never woolly hair, because they frequently rub their hair and head with coco-nut oil, which hinders the too copious perspiration; and I shall hereafter prove these fair people to be originally descended from a fairer and less swarthy or parched race, whose type or model is commonly preserved in their offspring. Upon the whole, a moderate heat accelerates the growth of human hair; this needs no proof, as it is well known that hair grows stronger in summer than in winter; every body is apprised of the common fact, that the marks of puberty appear sooner with people in hot climates, than with those who dwell in colder regions.12</note></ref> their chins are
								surrounded with respectable beards, which they now and then tie up
								in a knot; their features are strong and masculine, the ear-laps are
								cut and enlarged in the same manner as in Easter Island. I saw one
								man, who had eighteen tortoise-shell ear-rings of one inch diameter,
								and three quarters of an inch breadth. Their limbs are strong and
								active, marked by fine outlines. Their females have generally coarse
								features, few having any thing agreeable or pleasing in their round
								face, with thick lips and wide mouths. Their teeth are fine, their
								eyes lively, the hair finely curled, the body in such as have not
								yet borne children, is well proportioned, with a flowing outline,
								and fine extremities. The generality are of a mild and good natured
								temper, ready to please their guests in every thing in which they
								can be serviceable: but the ungrateful soil affording them only a
								sparing subsistence, and that too, not to be procured without much
								labour, they could not supply us with any roots or vegetables; and
								we were obliged to provide them with the first dog and bitch, and
								the first boar and sow, which in time to come may perhaps supply
								them with a new and acceptable change of food.</p><p n="311">Secondly. The inhabitants of Tanna, one of the New Hebrides, are
								almost of the same swarthy colour as the former; only a few had a
								clearer complexion, and in these the tips of their hair were of a
								yellowish brown: the hair and beards of the rest are all black and
								crisp, nay, in some woolly. The generality of them are tall, stout,
								and well made, none of them are corpulent or fat. The features of
								the greatest part are manly and bold, and but few are disagreeable.
								Their females are of the same complexion, have before child-bearing,
								generally a fine outline, but they are all ill-favoured, nay, some
								are very ugly: I saw but two, who had less harsh lineaments, and a
								smile upon their countenance. Both sexes have large holes in the lap
								of their ear, and wear several large rings of tortoise-shell in
								them; the septum narium is likewise perforated, and they wear a
								stick or whitish cylindrical stone in it. The hair of these people
								is dressed in the most curious and singular manner; for they take a
								small parcel of their hair, of the thickness of a pigeons quill and
								queue it up in the outer rind of a convolvulus, and thus they go on
								till they have finished the whole, which grows very copiously; by
								this means their heads bear some resemblance to a porcupine covered
								with prickly quills. Their whole body is naked; and the genitals
								only, are curiously wrapped up in leaves tied by a string, and then
								tucked up to a rope which they wear round their waists. On their
								breasts and arms are figures cut in, to which they apply some plant
								that raises a scar above the rest of the skin. They are a good
								natured, friendly set of men, exercising hospitality in a high
								degree. They seem to be valorous in encountering enemies, who are
								equal to them in arms; nay, before they perfectly knew how far our
								arms were superior to, and more destructive than theirs, a single
								man with a dart or sling, would often stand in a path, and hinder a
								party of eight or ten of us from going higher up into the country.
								They were mistrustful and jealous in the beginning; but after we had
								learnt a few words of their language, and convinced them that we did
								not intend to do them any harm, they let us freely pass and repass.
								I have gone accompanied by one or two persons only, several miles up
								the country. I hardly know an instance of their stealing any thing
								from us. They shewed at times, almost as much levity as the other
								nations of the South Seas; though in my opinion they were in general
								more grave; however they are lively, brisk, and ready to do any
								service that lies in their power or to give any information that is
								wanted, provided the enquirer can make himself understood.</p><p n="312">Thirdly. The natives of Mallicollo are a small, nimble, slender,
								black and ill-favoured set of being; that of all men I ever saw,
								border the nearest upon the tribe of monkies.13 Their skulls are of
								a very singular structure, being from the root of the nose more
								depressed backward, than in any of the other races of mankind, which
								we had formerly seen. Their women are ugly and deformed, and as I
								have before remarked in each of the varieties of men of the second
								race, they were here likewise obliged to act the part of
								pack-horses, in carrying provisions for their indolent husbands, and
								to do all the most laborious drudgery in the plantations. The hair
								is in the greater part of them woolly and frizzled. Their ears and
								noses perforated, for the insertion of large rings in the one, and
								of sticks or stones in the other. Their complexion is sooty, their
								features harsh, the cheek bone and face broad, and the whole
								countenance highly disagreeable. Their limbs are slender, though
								well shaped, and the belly constricted by a string to such a degree,
								as no European could bear without the greatest inconvenience. The
								genitals are wrapped in and tucked up, in the same manner as at
								Tanna and New Caledonia. One of their arms is ornamented by a
								bracelet fixed on it when young, and which therefore, can never
								after be removed in grown persons. I observed several among these
								people, who were very hairy all over the body, the back not
								excepted; and this circumstance I also observed in Tanna and New
								Caldonia. They are nimble, lively, and restless; some of them seem
								to be ill-natured and mischievous; but the generality, of a friendly
								and good disposition. They seem to love joy and merriment; music,
								songs, and dances. Though their poisoned arrows had no effect upon
								our dogs, I am however, not yet clear that they are entirely
								harmless; if so the natives would not have so anxiously withheld our
								hands, whenever we wanted to try the points of these infected arrows
								with our fingers: nor can I conceive for what reason they should
								take so much trouble in smearing and preserving the resinous
								substance on the boney points of these arrows: Quiros who saw the
								same nation, likewise suspected their arrows to be poisoned.14 I am
								therefore apt to suspect them to be very cruel and implacable
								enemies. I cannot at the same time omit to do them justice, in
								observing that they were not destitute of principles of humanity and
								equity. We saw the greater and more rational part of them extremely
								cautious in giving us any reason for complaint, and to such a degree
								were they anxious to prevent hostilities being commenced by their
								people, that they seem to have been sensible of the unjustice of
								giving the first provocation, which might bring on a retaliation on
								our side; nay, they hindered several of their people from giving
								even the least umbrage to us.15</p><p n="313"><q><emph>Medio vera terrae salubris utrimque mixtura, fertilis ad

								inches. Richard Hawkins*<ref target="#jf93"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf93">* Hawkins's Voyage to the South Seas, London, 1622.</note></ref> likewise speaks of tall people at Port St.
								Julian, in 1593, so tall that they are often taken by voyagers for
								giants. There are some Spaniards, who pretend that in the back of
								Chili, are a people of ten or twelve feet high: but as this account
								is too vague, and has not authority which may be depended upon, we
								will make no use of it. However, from the above mentioned numerous
								accounts, it appears, that on the continent of America, near Cape
								Virgin Mary, there is a nation, whose individuals undoubtedly are
								most remarkably stout and tall, none of them seem to be below five
								feet ten inches, several are above six feet, one was measured six
								feet seven inches high; nay, according to Pigasetta, some are said
								to be seven feet four inches; in the more interior parts of South
								America, are tribes of a size still greater than those who were
								measured by Captain Wallis; for Mr. Falkner,**<ref target="#jf94"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf94">** Falkner's Description of Patagonia, p. 26, 111, 112.</note></ref> who spent several
								years among these nations, describes the great Cacique Cangapol, who
								resided at Huichin upon the Black River, as being seven feet and
								some inches high, because on tiptoe, he could not reach to the top
								of his head: and he adds, that he did not recollect ever to have
								seen an Indian that was above an inch or two taller than Cangapol;
								and the brother of this tall Cacique, was about six feet high: these
								brethren belonged to the tribe of Puelches. These nations seldom
								resort to the sea, or the neighbourhood of the Straits of Magellan,
								and are therefore little known to such navigators as touch at those
								unfrequented places. It will perhaps appear to us a strange
								phaenomenon, that a whole nation should preserve that remarkable
								tall stature. But we are united in societies, where the constant
								intercourse with foreigners, makes it next to impossible to preserve
								the purity of races without mixture; and pity it is, that the guiles
								of art and deceit are so great in one sex, and curiosity, levity,
								and lewdness, are so common in the other, in our enlightened and
								highly-civilized societies, that they contribute still more to make
								the preservation of races precarious. This depravation prevailed so
								far, that even Omai became the object of concupiscence of some
								females of rank.18 The Puelches, on the contrary, and the other
								Patagonian tribes, whatever be their names, live in a country, which
								is little frequented by nations different from their own; their
								neighbours, the Spaniards, in Chili and Rio de la Plata, having very
								little intercourse with them, and being happy to live undisturbed
								from the incursions and depredations of such dangerous enemies. They
								procure, with great facility, their livelihood by the chace, and
								from their own numerous herds, in a country rich in pastures, and of
								immense extent, bounded by the sea, and separated by high ridges of
								mountains from all other nations. These are the most effectual means
								of preventing the degeneracy and debasement of their noble and
								athletic race; and we may conclude from thence, that constant
								intermarriages in the same tall tribes, render the great size of
								body more fixed, and invariably settled; nor must it be omitted,
								that as growth depends on food, climate, and exercise, in these
								nations, all these circumstances concur to make them a strong,
								stout, and tall race of men. The chace provides them plentifully
								with food, which is both varied and salubrious. The climate is
								moderate, and they have cloth made of the best skins and furrs, to
								serve them in any season. Lastly, they are seldom at rest, they move
								and roam over all the immense parts of America, South of the river
								of Plate, to the very straits of Magellan; they hunt, ride, and
								learn the use of their arms, and therefore take the most salutary
								exercise, communicating to their body and its parts sufficient
								strength and consistence, without crippling their limbs by too
								early, too violent, or too long continued labour, or starving them
								into a puny figure, by too close application, drudgery, and the
								exhaustion of their animal and vital spirits. This argument is
								likewise confirmed by a curious instance in our Northern climate.
								The guards of the late king, Frederick William of Prussia, and
								likewise those of the present monarch, who all are of an uncommon
								size, have been stationed at Potzdam, for fifty years past. A great
								number of the present inhabitants of that place are of a very high
								stature, which is more especially striking in the numerous gigantic
								figures of women. This certainly is owing to the connections and
								intermarriages of the tall men with the females of that town.*<ref target="#jf95"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf95">* Though I have been myself at Potzdam, it is however so long ago, and at so early a period of life, when people are not mindful enough, or capable of making observations, that I never took notice of it; but I owe this information to a gentleman whose spirit of observation, and literary talents make his authority indisputable.</note></ref>
								Having therefore stated both the probability and reality of such a
								tall race of men in Patagonia, from the best authenticated
								testimonies of respectable writers, and from arguments founded in
								nature; I shall take leave of this subject with the obvious remark,
								that it is as unjust as it is illiberal to rail at those who are
								still of opinion, that such tall people are found on the extremity
								of South America.</p><p n="316">To the South of the straits of Magalhaens, on Tierra del Fuego, are a
								tribe of people apparently much debased, or degenerated from those
								nations which live on the continent. Their broad shoulders and
								chests, large heads, and the general cast of their features, would
								prove them to be descended from the men living next to them, though
								that faithful and intelligent writer, Mr. Falkner had not informed
								us, that they belonged to the Yacanacunnees.=<ref target="#jf96"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf96">= Falkner's Description of Patagonia, p. 91, 111.</note></ref> But at the same time I
								shall likewise observe, that it appears from the accounts mentioned
								before, that the tall race of men seen by Admiral Byron, Captain
								Wallis, Mr. Bougainville, Mr. de la Giraudais, and Mr. Du Clos
								Guyot, were all provided with horses, of which all the families of
								the Yacana-cunnees are destitute; for which very reason they derive
								their name; Yanaca-cunnee, signifying footmen: and as those observed
								by Captain Cook in his first voyage,**<ref target="#jf97"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf97">** Hawkesworth's compilation, vol. 2. p.</note></ref> and by several Dutch,×<ref target="#jf98"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf98">× Recueil des Voyages pour l'Etablissement de la Comp. des Indes-Orientales, v. 4</note></ref> and
								French navigators,F<ref target="#jf99"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf99">F Bougainville's Voyage.</note></ref> had no horses, and commonly navigated back
								canoes, the above assertion of Mr. Falkner becomes more confirmed.
								Nevertheless it may be very possible, that the inhabitants of the
								more Western parts of Tierra del Fuego, may be descended from some
								branches of the Key-yus, a tribe of the Huilliches, who belong to
								the nation of the Moluches; and are rather of low stature, but broad
								and thick set.×<ref target="#jf100"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf100">× Falkner's Descr. of Patagonia, p. 112.</note></ref> And really somewhat similar to them were the few
								people, whom we met with at Christmas Bay. We found them to be a
								short, squat race, with large heads; their colour yellowish brown;
								the features harsh, the face broad, the cheek-bones high and
								prominent, the nose flat, the nostrils and mouth large, and the
								whole countenance without meaning.19 The hair is black and straight,
								hanging about the head in a shocking manner, their beards thin, and
								cut short. All the upper part of the body is stout, the shoulders
								and chest broad; the belly straight, but not prominent; and the
								scrotum very long. The feet are by no means proportioned to the
								upper parts; for the thighs are thin and lean, the legs bent, the
								knees large, and the toes turned inwards. They are absolutely naked,
								and have only a small piece of seal-skin hanging down and covering
								part of their back. Their women are much of the same features,
								colour, and form as the men, and have generally long hanging
								breasts, and besides the seal-skin on their backs, a small patch of
								the skin of a bird or seal to cover their privities. All have a
								countenance announcing nothing but their wretchedness. They seem to
								be good-natured, friendly and harmless; but remarkably stupid, being
								incapable of understanding any of our signs, which, however, were
								very intelligible to the nations of the South Sea. We could observe
								no other word distinctly, than that of pesserai,20 which they
								frequently repeated, in a manner to make us believe they intended to
								signify that they are friends; and that they find a thing good. When
								they talked, I particularly remarked, that their language included
								the r, and an l, preceded by an English th, something like the Ll of
								the Welsh, and many other lisping sounds. They stunk immoderately of
								train-oil, so that we might smell them at a distance; and in the
								finest days, they were shivering with cold. Human nature appears no
								where in so debased and wretched a condition, as with these
								miserable, forlorn, and stupid creatures.</p></div><div type="chapter" n="22" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head><l>SECTION III</l><l>On the Causes of the difference in the races of Men in

								Europe or Tcherkassia:*<ref target="#jf105"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf105">* Voltaire, Philosophie de l'histoire &amp;amp; questions sur L'Encyclopedie, tom iv. &amp;amp; tom vii.</note></ref> and, indeed, if we are at once to make a
								sudden transition from the contemplation of the fairest beauty of
								Europe to that of a deformed negro; the difference is so great, and
								the contrast so strong, that we might be tempted to think them of a
								distinct species: but if we examine the insensible gradations, in
								the form, habit, size, colour, and some external differences, we
								shall find that they are by no means so widely remote from each
								other in the scale of beings, as to form separate species.
								Anatomically considered, they perfectly agree, in all the material
								great parts of their frame, and even in the particulars of their
								structure, and consequently they cannot constitute different
								species. For considering that if the most remote tribes of mankind
								cohabit together, they always procreate children similar to their
								parents and capable of procreating others, the difference cannot be
								so material; especially if we remark, that by continually repeated
								marriages of a Mulatto (who is the offspring of a black and white
								person) with white persons, the progeny after each marriage, becomes
								fairer and fairer, so that at last not the least difference is
								observable; or that if the Mulatto marries a black person, their
								offspring is blacker, and after a few inter-marriages the race is
								reduced to absolute negroes: after these remarks, I say it must
								become more and more evident to minds free from prejudice or rancour
								against religion, that all mankind, though ever so much varied, are,
								however, but of one species. If therefore this class of antagonists,
								should deny the scripture that veneration, in which it is held by
								Christians, they cannot, however, refuse it with any colour of
								justice, the authority of an old historical account; and as such we
								find it corroborates strongly the above result of philosophical
								enquiry, by telling us, that all mankind are descended from one
								couple.</p><p n="324">If all mankind be of one species, and sprung from the same original
								stem, how then does it happen that the negroe of Senegal is so
								different from the inhabitant of the North of Europe? What occasions
								the inhabitants of O-Taheitee to be so much distinguished from the
								Mallicolese? We have hinted before, that these two varieties of men
								in the South-Seas, are descended from two distinct races.7 This is
								not decisive, and only leads us further into the same discussions,
								and requires us to shew what causes have produced these two distinct
								races or varieties of men?</p><p n="325">The question cannot be discussed unless we consider the subject under
								various heads. The differences are either observed in the organic
								part of man, or they respect his mental and moral faculties: of the
								last we shall treat at large in subsequent sections; at present we
								intend to confine ourselves to the corporeal varieties, consisting
								in, 1st, colour; 2d, size; 3d, form and habit; and 4th, peculiar
								defects or excesses, or modifications in certain parts of the human
								body.</p><p n="326">First, The Colour of the human body depends no doubt upon these three
								great causes: 1st, exposure to the air; 2d, the influence of the
								sun; and 3d, some particular circumstances in the mode of living.
								From the best enquiries set on foot by anatomists, it appears, that
								all the difference of colour lies in the human skin, and especially
								in the outer-integument called the cuticle, which again is
								considered by them under the two denominations of Epidermis and
								Malpighi's reticular membrane. In white people, the Epidermis is a
								very thin, pellucid, indurated lamella, transmitting the colour of
								the reticular membrane immediately lying under it, which is a white
								or colourless, viscous or slimy substance: whatever colour the
								substance has which is immediately under the Epidermis, that colour
								appears and becomes visible to the eye. The blood suddenly mounting
								into the blood vessels of the face, tinges the same with a
								vermillion blush. The blood being coloured by the extravasated bile,
								causes the yellow colour of the jaundice. The yellow lymph deposited
								in the cutaneous vascula, imparts the yellow tint of those who in
								the West Indies are afflicted with the yellow fever. The tattowing
								of the O-Taheiteans, and gunpowder accidentally forced into the
								skin, forms a black or blueish appearance. And in negroes, the late
								ingenious Mr. Meckel*<ref target="#jf106"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf106">* Meckel in the Memoires de l'Academie de Berlin, 1753.</note></ref> discovered the reticulum of Malpighi to be
								black; but the medullar substance of the brain, the pineal gland,
								and the spinal marrow, together with the plexus nervi optici, he
								found grey and blackish. Others=<ref target="#jf107"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf107">= Towns in the Philos. Trans. on the blood of negroes.</note></ref> have found the blood of negroes to
								be deeper coloured than that of white people. The ancients× knew
								that the spermatic liquor of negroes is of a dark hue, and this
								curious observation is confirmed by moderns.F<ref target="#jf108"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf108">F Le Cat Trait‚ sur la couleur de la peau.</note></ref> In a word, we find,
								that many of the fluids in negroes are tinged darker, and such of
								their solids as are of a tender and delicate texture, are likewise
								coloured blackish. Meckel suspects, that the blueish liquor which
								colours the medullary substance of the brain, and so easily
								evaporates in negroes, contributes towards the dark complexion of
								the mucous membrane of the cuticle, being secreted by the cutaneous
								nerves into the viscous reticular substance.</p><p n="327">But let us now investigate the causes of this phaenomenon in negroes;
								we have already indicated the three most striking causes; the
								exposure to the air, is undoubtedly one of the most powerful: for do
								we not see this daily proved in our own climate; our ladies, and
								other people who are little exposed to the action of the air, have a
								fair complexion; whereas the common labourers are brown and tawny;
								nay our bodies furnish us with sufficient proofs; those parts which
								are constantly covered, are fair and delicate, but the hands being
								constantly exposed to the action of the air, acquire a darker hue.
								The negroes live in a climate which permits them to wear little or
								no covering at all; accordingly, we really find all the negroes
								naked, or very slightly covered, which undoubtedly must increase the
								black colour of their skin. The Taheiteans, the fairest of all the
								islanders in the South Sea, go almost constantly dressed and
								covered. The inhabitants of Tanna, New Caledonia, and Mallicollo, on
								the contrary are always naked, and exposed to the air, and therefore
								infinitely blacker than the first.</p><p n="328">The operation of the Sun is undoubtedly another great cause of the
								dark hue in negroes; we find that nations in the same proportion, as
								they approach the equator, likewise become darker coloured; however,
								this observation is not quite universal, and ought to be modified
								under many circumstances. Inhabitants of islands are seldom so black
								as those of great continents; in Africa, between the tropics, the
								Easterly winds prevail the most; and as in Abyssinia these winds
								come over a large ocean, where they are mitigated and cooled in
								their passage, the inhabitants of that country are not so black as
								those about Senegal, which is situated in the broadest part of
								Africa, and where the Easterly wind having passed over the burning
								sands of the immense continent, is become infinitely more fiery and
								parching than in any other part. A higher exposure above the surface
								of the sea, makes a great difference in the temperature of the air;
								the inhabitants of Quito in Peru, though living under the line, are
								by no means black or swarthy. The vicinity of the sea, and its
								refreshing and gently fanning breezes, contribute greatly to
								mitigate the power of a tropical sun. This cause cannot be applied
								to the difference of colour in the Taheiteans and the Mallicolese,
								as both nations enjoy the same advantage.</p><p n="329">But the peculiar modes of living likewise, strongly co-operate with
								the above causes, in producing the many changes of colour in the
								human species. The Taheiteans are constantly cleanly, and practise
								frequent ablutions, encreasing by this simple elegance the fairness
								of their complexions, though they live within the tropics. The New
								Zeelanders living in the temperate zone from 3° to 4° South
								latitude, are more tawny, which may be in part ascribed to their
								uncleanliness, abhorrence of bathing, and sitting exposed to smoak
								and nastiness in their dirty cottages.</p><p n="330">Secondly. The size of the natives of Taheitee, and all the isles
								peopled by the same race, certainly distinguishes them from the
								tribes in Mallicollo; however this difference is not so general in
								these nations, as to extend even to Tanna and New Caledonia, where
								we found many very tall and athletic persons. But the chiefs in the
								Society Isles, again distinguish themselves from the rest of the
								inhabitants, by their tall stature and corpulence. According to the
								doctrines of those who are skilled in philosophy, growth and size
								depend chiefly upon climate, food, and exercise.</p><p n="331">The climate is either warm or cold. Heat adds to the action of the
								heart a stimulus, and accelerates its pulsation; and since in a warm
								climate, the solids are more relaxed, than in a cold one, the
								impulse of the blood in the arteries finds less resistance, and
								therefore more powerfully expands the whole frame of the body;
								because, every function of the parts and secretion of the liquids,
								is promoted with greater vigour. This we find conformable to
								experience, for in hot climates mankind grow more powerfully, and
								attains earlier maturity and puberty. On the other hand, cold
								assuages the stimulus, and constricts the fibres, which naturally
								throws the whole system into a torpor or languid state. The heart
								does not act powerfully enough to carry on the functions with that
								vigour which is required, not only to accelerate growth, but
								likewise to overcome the greater resistance caused by the rigid
								state of all the solid parts. We find in consequence of these
								principles, the poor inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego, a small race
								of people, though descended from tribes, who, on the continent of
								South America, in a milder climate, and more happy circumstances,
								are very tall and athletic.</p><p n="332">Food another great article, both as to quantity and quality, exerts
								its powerful influence upon size and growth. The great abundance and
								excellence of tropical fruits and roots, together with a variety and
								plenty of fish, and now and then a fowl, a hog, or a dog, contribute
								to the luxuries of the table of Arees and other people of rank, in
								the Society Isles; and as they are used to indulge very much in
								these luxuries, we find them remarkably tall, stout, and athletic.9
								The Towtows have only the bare necessaries; and we were informed
								that now and then there are years of scarcity, when the poorer sort
								of people are driven to great distress; but the Arees feel nothing
								of these inconveniences. The Towtows never, or at least very rarely
								partake of the feasts, where pork is devoured by the chiefs, but
								must rest contented with the more homely vegetable fare, and think
								themselves fortunate, if they catch some fish, or collect some
								wretched small shell fish, and even blubbers. In the Marquesas
								animal food is more scarce in proportion; nor are the islands upon
								the whole, overstocked with other eatables: for which reason we
								found, that though the natives were not small, very few however, if
								any, were so tall and so athletic as on the Society Isles, and above
								all, the difference between Arees and Towtows was not so striking.
								In the Friendly Isles, the abundance of vegetables is great, because
								private property has been the cause of a higher degree of
								cultivation; and animal food seems likewise to be plentiful: here
								however, the disparity in the size of Arees and Towtows is not so
								great as in the Society Isles.10 In New Zeeland, the inhabitants are
								in general well provided with fish, and they are not without
								extensive plantations of roots in the Northern isle; nor do they
								seem famished or stinted, as the greater part are tall and strongly
								built. The isles of Tanna and New Caledonia have plenty of vegetable
								food, though little of the animal kind; nay, in New Caledonia, they
								had before our arrival, neither dogs nor hogs; but the extensive
								reefs surrounding their isle, afford them great plenty of fish: this
								circumstance no doubt, contributed to the formation of their strong
								and tall bodies. Lastly, the Mallicolese seem to have plantations of
								all kinds of fruit in great abundance, some hogs, fowls, and plenty
								of fish, but they are the only nation who seemed not to be benefited
								by this affluent and excellent food; nor could we assign the reasons
								of their diminished size. The inhabitants of the Western parts of
								Tierra del Fuego, have doubtless no other food than what the sea
								affords them, which is very precarious in so high a latitude,
								especially in stormy weather. Of vegetables, they have only a few
								berries; which seems to indicate, that from time to time they are
								distressed, and their wretched appearance does not contradict it;
								their diminutive size, and small thin legs and thighs rather prove
								that they are famished and stinted: nor can the half rotten pieces
								of raw seals-flesh and fat be very salubrious and nutritive; which
								we saw them devour with a voracity that did not indicate either the
								abundance or the excellence of their provisions.</p><p n="333">Exercise in a moderate degree, is absolutely necessary to give the
								various part of the human frame, strength and due consistence.
								Inactivity hinders the secretion and circulation of the fluids,
								necessary for the increase of the body, and therefore causes in
								young people a weakly constitution, and flaccid limbs, without
								stability, consistence, or vigour. Violent labour is equally hurtful
								in regard to the increase of the body; for too long an exertion of
								muscular fibres in young men causes a rigidity, and entirely
								exhausts the vital powers. Let us only cast an eye on the wretched
								objects, who, from their infancy toil in confinement, and observe
								their distorted, disproportioned limbs, their ghastly faces, and
								their puny stinted size. On the contrary, the whole body acquires by
								a moderate and equal use of all our parts, a constitution which is
								gradually steeled against decay and diseases: an equal share of
								agility is imparted to all the limbs, which knits the joints to
								their due consistence and stability. The inhabitants of the South
								Sea isles, are by their lively temper in their early age prevented
								from being inactive. The happiness of their climate, the fertility
								of their soil, the luxuriance of vegetation, and the fewness of
								their wants, also make too great an exertion unnecessary: it is
								therefore moderate exercise which, among many other happy
								circumstances, contribute to form these tall and beautiful figures,
								which are so common among them.</p><p n="334">Thirdly, Form and habit, are likewise subject to the same influence
								of climate, food, and exercise; this spares us the trouble of
								repeating the above mentioned arguments: for it is evident that heat
								dries the limbs and whole frame of body in the Mallicolese, the
								inhabitants of Easter-Island, the Marquesas, the Low Islands, the
								Towtows and lower ranks of people in the Society and Friendly Isles,
								who all go naked, and are much exposed to air and sun: hence, they
								become thin and slender; for even their bones are not strong, but
								solid and hard. On the other hand, cold climates give a more soft,
								spungy and succulent habit of body; which is easily observable in
								the people of Tierra del Fuego, who are a thick, squat, bony race of
								men. The New-Zeelanders are likewise in a milder climate, fleshy,
								boney, and succulent, and the Arees and better sort of people, in
								the Society and Friendly Isles, who carefully study, and endeavour
								to keep themselves cool, and avoid as much as possible, an exposure
								to the heat of the sun, are succulent, fleshy, and fat.</p><p n="335">Fourthly, The peculiar defects, or excesses, or modifications of
								certain parts of the human body have endemial11 causes, dependent
								upon peculiar customs, which sometimes are obvious, but at other
								times not easily investigated, especially when the observer has not
								more time to study them, than we had. However, we will point them
								out, and leave it to others to make further discoveries.</p><p n="336">In Mallicollo, we observed that the greater part of the skulls of the
								inhabitants, had a very singular conformation; for the forehead from
								the beginning of the nose, together with the rest of the head, was
								much depressed and inclining backward: which causes an appearance in
								the looks and countenances of the natives, similar to those of
								monkies. Whether the inhabitants use some art to give the heads of
								their children this figure, or whether it be owing to some other
								cause, or to an original defect of the whole generation, which in
								the first couple from whom this tribe descended, was modelled by
								chance or art into that form, and afterwards became inherent and
								natural to their offspring, it is impossible to determine. The
								inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego, are all a chubbed race, probably
								because they are descended from a set of people of large limbs,
								living on the continent, but being stinted by cold, and wants of all
								kinds, are degenerated into a short, and squat figure, which keeps
								always the original model, or type, in the size of the head; a
								circumstance almost generally observed in dwarfs.</p><p n="337">The feet are generally thin, and by no means proportioned to the rest
								of the body, in the New-Zeelanders, and the people of Tierra del
								Fuego, and they likewise have large knees.12 This may be easily
								accounted for from their general practice of fishing, which confines
								them for days together to their canoes, without allowing them the
								usual exercise; and from their constant sitting upon their hams,
								which stretches and expands the knees, and prevents the legs from
								being furnished with the supplies necessary for the increase of
								those parts. The people in the isles walk much, but likewise sit on
								their hams, and we find their knees also, and their whole legs
								enlarged, from the great exertion of those parts, which are not
								compressed and restrained as ours, by shoes and other articles of
								dress.</p><p n="338">The faces are in general strongly marked with large features, and
								somewhat broad, but prominent noses, in all the islanders of the
								South Seas; and this seems to be, in my opinion, the character of
								the nation, or tribe, from which they are descended. The more
								Western tropical isles have inhabitants with less prominent noses,
								larger mouths, and broader lips, which again must be referred to the
								original tribe from whence they are derived.</p><p n="339">The laps of the ears are certainly cut and enlarged by constantly
								keeping a sugar-cane leaf scrolled up in this hole, in
								Easter-Island, New-Caledonia, and partly in Tanna. The inhabitants
								of Tonga-Tabu, and the Friendly-Isles, enlarge the laps of the ears
								likewise, but without making an incision, and have only two
								perforations in them, through which they thrust horizontally a small
								stick, of the thickness of a strong goose-quill. The greater part of
								the same nation want the two first joints of one, and sometimes both
								the little fingers, which they cut off as marks of their grief, for
								deceased parents or relations.</p><p n="340">The inhabitants of O-Taheitee and the Society-Isles, are circumcised;
								but properly speaking, a part of the prepuce is not cut off, but a
								round smooth stick being thrust into it, it is slit through the
								upper part, with a bamboo, to which they have given a sharp edge;
								and then the parts are kept divided, that they may not cover the
								glans again.</p><p n="341">The breasts of the women of O-Taheitee, the Society-Isles, Marquesas,
								and Friendly-Isles, are not so flaccid and pendulous as is commonly
								observed in negro-women, and as we likewise noticed them in all the
								Western islands, in New-Zeeland, and some of the females of the
								lower sort at the Society-Isles. This has been lately ascribed to
								the manner of suckling the children;*<ref target="#jf109"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf109">* Blumenbach de Generis Humani Varietate Nativa, p. 73.</note></ref> but I am of opinion that it
								cannot be solely owing to this; for the women of the Arees never
								have them so pendulous and long. I should rather ascribe it to the
								greater relaxation of the body in the women of the lower class, who
								are more exposed to the air and sun, than those of the Aree tribe.
								In the same manner the negroe-women, as well as those in the Western
								Isles of Mallicollo, Tanna, and New-Caledonia, are for the greater
								part more exposed to the air and sun, being constantly naked above
								the waist. The gentle constriction of the upper part of the body, by
								the finer sorts of cloth in which the O-Taheitean women of quality
								gracefully wrap themselves, contributes likewise to keep the breasts
								high, and to prevent their flaccidity and pendulous state. I saw
								some very old fat women in the Society-Isles, whose breasts were
								relaxed and enlarged, but by no means long and pendulous, which,
								however, was a very common circumstance in all the women of the
								Western-Isles, who had borne and suckled children.</p><p n="342">The chiefs in the Society-Isles value themselves on having long nails
								on all, or on some of their fingers; it is an evident proof of their
								indolence, and that they are not obliged to work, which would soon
								deprive them of this distinguishing mark of their pre-eminence; they
								are, however, very careful in keeping these long nails clean, and
								free from any impurity; the custom of tattowing the faces in spirals
								and various scrolls, which prevails in New-Zeeland, and the various
								figures with which the natives of the Marquesas puncture their
								faces, naturally destroys the growth of hair, and to this we must
								ascribe it, that in both places, those who are much punctured, have
								very little or no beards at all.</p><p n="343">These are the most remarkable particulars which chiefly form the
								variety of the two great tribes, observed by us in the South Sea
								isles; from whence may be inferred the powerful influence of
								climate, food, and peculiar customs upon the colour, size, habit,
								and form of body, and certain defects, excesses, or modifications of
								the parts; but it must be acknowledged at the same time, that the
								causes here enumerated are not the only ones, and particularly that
								climate alone does not produce such extraordinary effects; for we
								find that the Dutch, who have been settled at the Cape of Good Hope,
								during an uninterrupted course of 120 years, have constantly
								remained fair and similar to Europeans in every respect;
								notwithstanding, if we compare them with the Hottentots, the native
								inhabitants of that part of the world, it appears, that exclusive of
								the way of living and food, the climate alone cannot occasion this
								material and striking variety; nay, that even these causes, when
								united, are not sufficient to produce this effect, as some of the
								very remote Dutch farmers live almost in the same manner as their
								neighbours the Hottentots; they have wretched huts, instead of
								houses; lead a rambling nomadic life, attend their herds and flocks
								all day long, and live upon milk, the produce of the chace, and the
								flesh of their cattle; it is therefore evident, that if climate can
								work any material alteration, it must require an immense period of
								time to produce it; and as our lives are so short, our historical
								accounts so imperfect, in regard to the migrations of the human
								species, and our philosophical observations on the subject, all of a
								very modern date, it cannot be expected we can speak with precision
								on the subject.13</p><p n="344">It must however be observed, that when the fair Northern nations are
								removed into the hot tropical climates, they themselves and their
								progeny soon change, and gradually become somewhat more analogous in
								colour, and other circumstances, to the former inhabitants, whose
								migration is of so old a date, that no memorial of it is presented;
								still, however, they may be easily distinguished from these
								aboriginal tribes: it is likewise true, that nations removed from
								the vicinity of the line towards the poles, keep their native colour
								longer without alteration than any other people coming from older
								climates, and going to live in hotter regions; but such incidents
								must always be compared under similar circumstances: for if two
								Europeans, equally fair, are removed to the same hot climate, and
								the one is well dressed and avoids, as much as possible, being
								exposed to the action of the air, and power of the sun; whilst the
								other finds himself obliged to work in the open air, and has hardly
								any rags to cover his skin; they will, of natural consequence,
								become widely different in colour; moreover, if this diversity in
								the mode of living be kept up for several generations, the character
								of both must of course become more strikingly different.14 If we
								look upon the inhabitants of Denmark, we find them remarkably fair,
								and with blue eyes, and red hair. The Bohemians, Poles, Russians,
								and in general all the Slavonian nations, have a brownish
								complexion, dark eyes, and black or brown hair, though some of the
								latter undoubtedly live in higher latitudes than the former. The
								reason here certainly is not the climate, but the cause is to be
								found in their migrations; the Gothic nations are no doubt the most
								early inhabitants of the North, and therefore have had more time to
								become gradually fairer, than the greater part of their neighbouring
								European tribes; and they likewise have had less opportunities of
								marrying or becoming connected with such Southern nations, as had a
								brown complexion and black hair. The Slavonian nations or
								Sauromatae, are later descended from the Medes,*<ref target="#jf110"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf110">* Diod. Sicul. lib. 2do. &amp;amp; Plin. Hist. Nat. lib. vi. c. 7.15</note></ref> a nation formerly
								living in modern Persia; they were long settled to the North of the
								Caucasus and Black Sea, a country which is very hot in summer; and
								in the fifth century they were near the Danube, from whence they
								gradually spread to the countries, which they now occupy: this
								account rationally resolves the strange phaenomenon, viz. that they
								still keep the national character, of a Southern tribe. They
								migrated from the South in a later period than the Goths, and other
								Teutonic tribes; and have had more opportunities of mixing with
								Asiatic tribes of a brown complexion, than the Northern Danes and
								Goths. This instance, I believe, confirms the above assertion; and
								it likewise appears from thence, that the fairer nations being
								exposed to a more powerful sun in hot climates, soon acquire a
								browner complexion. However, when they have once attained to a
								certain standard character, they preserve it with very immaterial
								alterations; but I suppose that they make no considerable change in
								their food, in their mode of dressing and living, and that they do
								not promiscuously intermarry with negroes, mulattos, or other
								aboriginal or mixed tribes of hot climates, in which cases, there
								are just reasons to suspect that their character and complexion must
								gradually degenerate, and become more and more debased; but if
								negroes, and other swarthy tribes, be transplanted into temperate,
								or nearly cold climates, they do not immediately change, nor do they
								easily become fairer, but preserve their original complexion for a
								longer space of time. When they only intermarry in their own race,
								the change, if any, is imperceptible in their offspring for many
								generations. I will here only hint, at the probable causes of this
								phaenomenon; the transition, from being brown in complexion to fair,
								is, it seems, more difficult, than that from fair to brown; the
								Epidermis admits the beams of the sun and the action of the air, in
								colouring the reticulum mucosum brown; but when once it is coloured,
								nothing is sufficiently powerful to extract the brown colour; and
								this seems to be founded in daily experience; a man being perhaps
								only one day exposed to a powerful sun, shall become strongly tinted
								with brown; when, to remove this hue, perhaps six or eight months of
								close confinement, are not sufficient. It seems therefore more and
								more probable, that the first stamen of an embryo partakes, much of
								the colour, size, form and habit of the parents; and that two
								different tribes, having gradually undergone a different round of
								climates, food, and customs; and coming afterwards at different
								periods of time, and by different ways, into the same climate, but
								preserving a different mode of living, and being partly supported by
								different food, may nevertheless preserve an evident difference in
								their character, colour, size, form, and habit of body.</p><p n="345">If we apply this induction to the two different tribes, whom we found
								in the South-Sea, it will appear to be highly probable, that they
								may be descended from two different races of men; and though living
								in the same climate, or nearly so, might, however, preserve a
								difference in character, colour, size, form and habit of body; and
								if I could now prove, by an historical argument, that they really
								are descended from two different races of men, nothing will be
								wanting to conviction. How far I shall succeed in this historical
								argument, will be easily seen from the following observation.</p><p n="346">It has always been customary among the more critical and chaste
								historians, to reckon all such nations as speak the same general
								language, to be of the same tribe or race; unless there be a
								positive proof to the contrary, in a good, authentic, contemporary
								writer; or one who has made enquiries on the subject from old
								materials, now no longer existing. By the same general language, I
								understand all the various subordinate dialects of one language. No
								one for instance, acquainted with the subject, will deny, that the
								Dutch, Low-German, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Icelandic, and the
								English (in respect to such words as owe their origin to the
								Anglo-Saxon) are dialects subordinate to the same original language,
								together with the present High-German, and the remains of the Gothic
								in Ulfila's New Testament. But allowing this, yet we find that these
								dialects differ in many respects, each having peculiar words, for
								ideas which the nation acquired later, after parting from the
								original tribe; and other words, which they obtained by connexions
								with, or the conquest of, another nation: many words, however,
								though somewhat modified, always preserve enough of the original
								type, to satisfy the critical etymologist, that they belong to the
								same general language, as subordinate dialects. This short
								digression will therefore open a way to prove that the five races,
								which I enumerated as belonging to the first tribe, are really
								descended from the same original nation; for they all speak a
								language that has in the greatest part of their word, a great and
								striking affinity.</p><p n="347">I took particular care in collecting the words of every peculiar
								nation we met with, that I might be enabled to form an idea of the
								whole, and how far all the languages are related to each other. I
								soon perceived, that in general, the five nations already
								enumerated, spoke a language differing only in a few words, and that
								for the greater part, the difference consisted in a few vowels or
								consonants, though the words still preserved a great affinity; nay,
								many were absolutely the same in all the dialects. I could therefore
								no longer doubt, that they were all descended from the same original
								stem, and that the differences in the language arose only from the
								difficulty of pronouncing consonants, which some sounded more
								easily, whilst others, either changed, or entirely omitted them.
								When a migrating race found in their new country, new birds, new
								fishes, and new plants, they must of course find new names for them,
								which could not exist in any other of the cogeneric dialects. The
								qualities of these new animals, the preparation of the new
								vegetables into food and garments, required other new names, and
								thus it happened, that their language gradually assumed a distinct
								appearance, though after all, it was the same with that of the
								original tribe, being modified only to suit the organs of the tribe,
								and the new objects of their country.</p><p n="348">Having now determined, that these people use the same general
								language in various dialects, we have only to prove, that the other
								nations are of a different race, from that, to which the first
								varieties own their origin; and this is very easy to prove in the
								same manner by their languages, which are not only wholly different
								from the abovementioned general language, but are likewise distinct
								from each other: so that one might with as much propriety say, that
								they are descended from as many different nations, were it not
								improper to multiply them without necessity, and as they really have
								some similarity in their customs, colour, form, and habit of
								body.</p><p n="349">If we are desirous of tracing the races of all these islanders back
								to my continent, or its neighbourhood, we must cast an eye on a map
								of the South Sea, where we find it bounded to the East by America,
								to the West by Asia, by the Indian Isles on its North side, and by
								New Holland to the South. At first sight, it might seem probably,
								that these tropical isles were originally settled from America, as
								the Easterly winds are the most prevalent in these seas, and as the
								small and wretched embarkations of the natives in the South Seas,
								can hardly be employed in plying to windward. But if we consider the
								argument more minutely, we find that America itself was not peopled
								many centuries before its discovery by the Spaniards. There were but
								two states or kingdoms on this immense continent, that had acquired
								any degree of population, and made considerable progress in
								civilization; and they likewise did not originate earlier, than
								about 300 or 400 years before the arrival of the Spaniards. The rest
								was occupied by a few straggling families, thinly dispersed over
								this vast tract of land, so that sometimes not more than 30 or 40
								persons, lived in an extent of 100 leagues at very great distances
								from each other. Again, when the Spaniards discovered some of these
								islands in the South Sea, a few years only after the discovery of
								the continent of America, they found them as populous as we have
								seen them in our days: from whence it appears to be highly
								improbable, that these isles were peopled from America. If we
								moreover consult the Mexican, Peruvian, and Chilese vocabularies,*<ref target="#jf111"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf111">* In Reland's Diss. Miscellan, vol. iii.</note></ref>
								and those of other American languages,=<ref target="#jf112"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf112">= A Manuscript Vocabulary of the Brazilian language, obligingly communicated by his Excellency the Chevalier Pinto.</note></ref> we find not the most
								distant, or even accidental similarity between any of the American
								languages, and those of the South Sea Isles. The colour, features,
								form, habit of body, and customs of the Americans, and these
								islanders, are totally different; as every one conversant with the
								subject, will easily discover. Nay, the distances of 600, 700, 800,
								or even 1000 leagues between the continent of America and the
								Easternmost of these isles, together with the wretchedness and small
								size of their vessels, prove, in my opinion, incontestably, that
								these islanders never came from America.</p><p n="350">We must therefore go to the Westward; let us begin with New Holland.
								All the former navigators, and especially Capt. Cook, in the
								Endeavour, found this immense continent very thinly inhabited. The
								diminutive size of its inhabitants, the peculiarity of their customs
								and habits, their total want of coco-nuts, cultivated plantanes, and
								hogs, together with the most miserable condition of their huts and
								boats, prove beyond all doubt, that the South Sea islanders, are not
								descended from the natives of New Holland. But, what is still more
								convincing, their language is totally different, as evidently
								appears from the examination of a vocabulary obligingly communicated
								to me by Capt. Cook. We have therefore nothing left but to go
								further to the North, where the South Sea isles are as it were
								connected with the East Indian isles. Many of these latter are
								inhabited by two different races of men. In several of the Moluccas
								is a race of men, who are blacker than the rest, with woolly hair,
								slender and tall, speaking a peculiar language, and inhabiting the
								interior hilly parts of the countries; in several isles these people
								are called Alfoories.*<ref target="#jf113"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf113">* Franc. Valentyn Beschryving van Amboina, ii deel. p. 71,-84. and Dan. Beeckman Voyage to Borneo, p. 43. who calls the Aboriginal people on Borneo Byajos.</note></ref> The shores of these isles are peopled by
								another nation, whose individuals are swarthy, of a more agreeable
								form, with curled and long hair, and of a different language, which
								is chiefly a branch or dialect of the Malayan. In all the
								Philippines, the interior mountainous parts, are inhabited by a
								black set of people, with frizzled hair, who are tall, lusty, and
								very warlike, and speak a peculiar language different from that of
								their neighbours. But the outskirts towards the sea are peopled with
								a race infinitely fairer, having long hair, and speaking different
								languages: they are of various denominations, but the Tagales,
								Pampangos, and Bissayas, are the most celebrated among them. The
								former are the more antient inhabitants, and the latter are
								certainly related to the various tribes of Malays, who had over-run
								all the East India islands before the arrival of the Europeans in
								those seas. Their language is likewise in many instances related to
								that of the Malays.**<ref target="#jf114"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf114">** Hernando los Rios Coronel, Relacion de las Islas Malucas.

								in its interior hilly parts, a set of brown, frizzly haired, broad
								faced inhabitants; but the shores, especially those to the North,
								are occupied by the Chinese, who differ even in language from the
								former. The isles of New Guinea, New Britain, and Nova Hibernia have
								certainly black complexioned inhabitants, whose manners, customs,
								habit, form, and character, correspond very much with the
								inhabitants of the South Sea islands belonging to the second race in
								Nova Caledonia, Tanna, and Mallicollo; and these blacks in
								New-Guinea, are probably related to those in the Moluccas and
								Philippines. The Ladrones, and the new discovered Caroline Islands,
								contain a set of people very much related to our first race. Their
								size, colour, habit, manners, and customs, seem strongly to indicate
								this affinity; and they are according to the account of some
								writers,=<ref target="#jf115"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf115">= Pere Gobien Historie des Isles Marianes, Paris, 1700, 12mo.</note></ref> nearly related in every respect to the Tagales in Lu‡on or
								Manilla, so that we may now trace the line of migration by a
								continued line of isles, the greater part of which are not above 100
								leagues distant from each other.</p><p n="351">We likewise find a very remarkable similarity between several words
								of the fair tribe of islanders in the South Sea, and some of the
								Malays. But it would be highly inconclusive from the similarity of a
								few words, to infer that these islanders were descended from the
								Malays: for as the Malay contains words found in the Persian,
								Malabar, Braminic, Cingalese, Javanese, and Malegass,*<ref target="#jf116"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf116">* Reland's Dissertationes Miscellaneae, vol. iii.</note></ref>
								this should
								likewise imply, that the nations speaking the above mentioned
								languages, were the offspring of the Malays, which certainly would
								be proving too much.16 I am therefore rather inclined to suppose,
								that all these dialects preserve several words of a more antient
								language, which was more universal, and was gradually divided into
								many languages, now remarkably different. The words therefore of the
								language of the South Sea isles, which are similar to others in the
								Malay tongue, prove clearly in my opinion, that the Eastern South
								Sea isles were originally peoples from the Indian, or Asiatic
								Northern isles; and that those lying more to the Westward, received
								their first inhabitants from the neighbourhood of New Guinea.</p><p n="352">We have therefore, I apprehend, probable proofs that these islanders
								came originally from the Indian Asiatic isles, on which we have
								pointed out two races of inhabitants, such as we found them in the
								South Sea isles: it should seem therefore, that these two distinct
								races are descended from the two distinct Indian tribes. If we had
								good vocabularies of the various languages spoken in these isles, we
								should then be enabled to trace their original back to a particular
								tribe. But as we labour under a deficiency in this respect, I have
								endeavoured in the annexed table to give a general view of many
								languages, which of course, must confirm my former assertions. I
								flatter myself with having done as much as could be expected in my
								situation, and therefore leave the rest to better instructed, and
								more enlightened ages.</p></div><div type="chapter" n="23" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head><l>SECTION IV</l><l>Various Progress, which the Nations we saw, have made

								rapid growth of animals and vegetables in these places; the facility

								weather; the variety and succession of fine and wholesome
								spontaneous roots and fruit, all lead us to suppose that man was

								Northern and Southern extremities of the temperate, or the vigour of

								invaders more firmly established; their manners more courteous,
								elegant, and even refined; their principles of morality better
								understood, and generally practised; their minds capable of, and
								open to instruction; they have ideas of a supreme being, of a future
								state, of the origin of the world; and the whole contributes greatly
								to increase their happiness, in its natural, moral and social
								branches, both as individuals, and as a nation. On the contrary, the
								wretched mortals towards the frozen zone, are the most debased of
								all human beings, in every respect. Their food is scanty, loathsome,
								and precarious; their habitations the most miserable huts that can
								be imagined; their garments rough, and by no means sufficient to
								screen them against the rigours of the inhospitable climate; their
								societies thin, and without any mutual ties or affection; exposed to
								the insults of all invaders, they retreat to the most inhospitable
								rocks, and appear insensible to all that is great and ingenious; a
								brutish stupidity is their general characteristic; and whenever they
								are the strongest, they are treacherous, and act in opposition to
								all the principles of humanity and hospitality. May we not then
								infer from the above premises, that man unconnected with highly
								civilized nations, approaches in more happy climates, nearer to that
								state of civilization, and happiness, which we enjoy; that human
								nature is really debased in the savages, who inhabit the frozen
								extremities of our globe, and that their present situation is as it
								were, a preternatural state.2 I wish not to be misunderstood; the
								happiness which European nations enjoy, and are capable of, becomes,
								on account of the degeneracy of a few profligate individuals, very
								much debased, and mixed with the miseries, which are entailed upon
								our civilized societies, by luxury and vice; if therefore the
								felicity of several European or Asiatic nations, seem to be inferior
								to that of some of the nations in the South Sea, it is owing to the
								above-mentioned causes, since it does not seem to follow, that a
								high degree of civilization must necessarily lessen, or destroy
								natural, moral, or social happiness.3</p><p n="355">I believe the nations inhabiting the frozen extremities of our globe
								to be degenerated and debased from that original happiness, which
								the tropical nations more or less enjoy. I was first persuaded into
								this belief, from the state in which we found the inhabitants of
								Tierra del Fuego and New Zeeland, and by comparing their situation,
								with that of their neighbours.</p><p n="356">The people on Tierra del Fuego, about Christmas Bay, were not
								numerous; and if we are to judge from the general appearance of the
								country, and from the numbers seen by other navigators, there cannot
								be a great population in these inhospitable climates. These were the
								Southernmost lands, wherein we found human creatures, who not only
								appeared to us to be wretched, but to be themselves conscious of
								their own misery, and forlorn situation; several boats, with
								natives, came to our ship, and none of them had any other garment
								than a piece of Sealskin, which did not reach so far as to cover
								half their buttocks, and came barely over the shoulders; their head
								and feet, and whole body, were exposed to a degree of cold in the
								midst of summer, which appeared to us sharp, though we were well
								clad, having found the temperature of the air generally from 4° to
								5° of Fahrenheits thermometer; neither the men nor the women, had
								any thing to cover their privities; their bodies smelled highly
								offensive from the rancid train oil which they frequently use, and
								the rotten seals flesh which they eat; and I am of opinion, their
								whole frame of body is thoroughly penetrated with this disagreeable
								smell. Their habitations consist of a few sticks, tied together, so
								as to form a kind of shell, for a low, open, roundish hut; they join
								the neighbouring shrubs together, and cover the whole with some
								wisps of dry grass, and here and there a few pieces of seals-skin
								are tied over; one fifth or sixth of the whole circumference, is
								left open for a door, and the fire place; their utensils and
								furniture, which we had an opportunity of observing, consisted of a
								basket, a kind of mat-satchel, a bone-hook, fixed to a long stick of
								a light kind of wood, for disengaging the shell-fish from the rocks,
								a rude bow and some arrows.4 Their canoes are made of bark, which is
								doubled round a pliant piece of wood, by way of gunwale, and a few
								sticks, of about the thickness of half an inch, are bent on the
								whole inside of the canoe, close to one another, so as to form a
								kind of strong deck, both for expanding the whole frame of the
								canoe, and preventing its bottom from being broken by walking on it;
								in one part of these poor embarkations, they lay up a little heap of
								soil, and on it they keep a constant fire, even in summer. Their
								food, beside the above-mentioned seals, are shell-fish, which they
								broil and devour; they were shivering, and appeared much affected
								with the cold: they looked at the ship and all its parts with a
								stupidity and indolence, which we had not hitherto observed in any
								of the nations in the South Seas, had all an empty stare in their
								countenances, and expressed hardly any desires or wishes to possess
								any thing which we offered, and thought it might become desirable to
								them; they were destitute of all convenience or ease, shewed no
								signs of joy or happiness, and seemed to be insensible to all
								natural, moral, or social feelings, and enjoyments, and occupied
								with nothing but their wants and wretchedness. This little tribe,
								observed by us, I suppose to be some outcasts of their brethren; for
								our officers, who landed in Success-Bay, reported, that the people
								there were much happier than those in Christmas-Harbour. If we again
								compare them with their neighbouring tribes on the continent, such
								as they are described by Mr. Thomas Falkner, who resided near 40
								years among them, we must confess, that those are in every respect
								superior; they have horses, and a greater variety of food, supplying
								themselves by the chace; their garments are better calculated to
								defend them against the injuries of the climate; their arms both
								offensive and defensive, prove genius and an exertion of mind, of
								which the poor inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego seem utterly
								incapable; they have a kind of civil government, some regulations
								for the security of their societies; leaders and chiefs are at the
								head of their tribes in war, and in peace. Their behaviour is by no
								means inequitable, harsh, or inhumane; their minds shew vigour and
								courage, their language is copious, elegant, and has marks of a
								peculiar culture. In short they are infinitely less wretched than
								their neighbours on Tierra del Fuego, who, to all appearance, are
								only degenerated into that forlorn condition in which we found them
								sunk.</p><p n="357">Dusky Bay is the Southernmost place on New-Zeeland, we touched at;
								the latitude of the place where the astronometers observatory was
								fixed, being 4° 47' South. We found this bay, which has several
								leagues of extent branching out into spacious inlets, stocked with
								many kinds of fowl, crowded with prodigious quantities of the best
								flavoured fish, and its rocks covered with numerous herds of seals;
								all which abundance would naturally invite people, who solely
								subsist upon fish and fowl, to settle here, and to become very
								numerous. But we found only three families in all this bay: their
								habitations consisted of a few sticks stuck into the ground, and
								meanly covered with flags and rushes: they had no idea of
								cultivating or planting; their garments were such as covered the
								upper part of the body, and left the legs and part of the thighs
								exposed, and they squatted down to shelter them under their clothes,
								which commonly were remarkably uncleanly; and the families settled
								here, seemed to be independent of each other. When we came to Queen
								Charlotte's Sound,5 we found on the shores of that equally spacious
								water, four or five hundred people, and some of them paid deference
								to several old men, as Tringoboohee, Goobaya, and Teir...too, who
								were it seems their chiefs. Fish were in this place equally
								abundant, but of a sort inferior in taste and goodness; wild fowl,
								especially of the aquatic kind, were scarcer, and we saw but one
								seal, though our two ships resided here at different times. The
								people were clad in the same manner as in the former place; their
								habitations, especially on their hippas or strong holds, were
								better, cleanlier, and lined on the inside with reeds; they had no
								plantations, but they knew the names of Tarro and Goomalla, which
								the inhabitants of the tropical isles give to the Arum esculentum
								and the Convolvulus Batatas. This, in my opinion, evidently proves
								that they were descended from a tribe, who had cultivation, and who
								had lost or neglected this way of supporting themselves, either
								because they found greater plenty of fish, and animal food; or
								because they fled their country in so precipitate a manner, that
								they could not take any roots with them; or lastly, from mere
								supineness and indolence; for we saw them eat fern roots, a very
								insipid, coarse, and wretched food. Whatever may be the real cause,
								the climate would certainly allow of planting eddoes and potatoes,
								being in 4° 5' South latitude; and it is evident that the natives
								were degenerated and debased from a more perfect and more happy
								state. The inhabitants of the Northern isle, who came off to us, had
								better boats, and were clad in finer garments; but we could not make
								many observations on their situation as we saw them only in a
								transitory manner; however, the published accounts of the preceding
								voyage, and those which I was favoured with by Capt. Cook, agree in
								this, that they had very extensive, regular, well-cultivated
								plantations, inclosed in very firm and neat fences, made of reeds;
								that they acknowledged the authority of a chief in a district of 80
								leagues at least, where our people found justice administered by
								inferior chiefs; and that they seemed to live in that district in
								greater security and more comfortably than in any other part of the
								isle. Hawksworth, vol. 3. p. 470.</p><p n="358">The natural inferences drawn from these data, seem to prove, that
								mankind being more numerous in or near the tropics, and very thinly
								scattered towards the cold extremities of our globe, the human
								species was originally settled in or near the tropics, and from
								thence spread towards the extremities. Secondly, the instances given
								here, evince likewise the truth of what we advanced before, viz.
								that the human species, when unconnected with the highly civilized
								nations, is always found more debased in its physical, mental, moral
								and social capacity, in proportion as it is removed from the
								tropical regions. It seems therefore probable that savage nations in
								cold climates, contract a harshness or rigidity in their fibres and
								frame of body, which causes sluggishness, indolence and stupidity of
								mind; their hearts grow insensible to the dictates of virtue, honor
								and conscience, and they become incapable of any attachment,
								affection or endearment.6</p><p n="359">Let us now turn our eyes to O-TAHEITEE, the queen of tropical isles,
								and its happy inhabitants, and extend our view to all the Society
								and Friendly Isles. Though we found population to be very great in
								proportion to the extent of country, yet we were led to believe that
								a much greater number of inhabitants might be supported on these
								islands, and in ages to come might be found there, if no accidents
								should happen, or unless such manners and regulations should be
								introduced as tend to check or stop the progress of population. The
								fertility of the soil on those extensive plains, and numerous
								valleys, the rapid vegetation and constant succession of coco-nuts,
								bread-fruit, apples, bananas, plantanes, eddoes, potatoes, yams, and
								many other fine fruits and roots; the regular division of lands in
								private property, well and neatly fenced in; the particular care
								shewn by the inhabitants to the dogs, hogs, and fowls, which are
								their only domestic animals; the convenience and neatness of their
								houses and boats, their ingenious contrivances for fishing; the
								taste and elegance shewn in many of their utensils and houshold
								furniture; their dresses so well adapted to the climate, so
								curiously varied both in their texture and dyes; their delicacy of
								manners, true courtesy and politeness; their chearful and open
								behaviour; their goodness of heart, and hospitality; their knowledge
								of plants, birds, fishes, shells, insects, vermes, and all the
								branches of animated nature; their acquaintance with the stars, and
								their motion, with the seasons and winds; their poetry, songs,
								dances, and dramatic performances; their theogony and cosmogony, the
								various ranks and regulations of civil society; their establishments
								for defence, and for repelling and retaliating injuries offered to
								their state; all these conspire to prove that they are infinitely
								superior to the before mentioned tribes; and even point out the true
								causes of their greater happiness. The climate certainly contributes
								a great deal to their felicity, and might be justly deemed the main
								source of it. However, as we found farther to the West, new isles in
								the same happy climate, and in the same latitude, the inhabitants of
								which, were nevertheless, infinitely inferior in point of
								civilization, and more defective in the enjoyments of real
								happiness; it seems to follow, that there must be, besides the
								above-mentioned, some other cause of this remarkable
								circumstance.</p><p n="360">All the ideas, all the improvements of mankind relative to sciences,
								arts, manufactures, social life, and even morality, ought to be
								considered as the sum total of the efforts of mankind ever since its
								existence. The first original tribes no doubt kept up connexions
								with one another, and thus they propagated and hoarded up useful
								knowledge, established principles, regulations, and mechanical
								trades for the benefit of their posterity. The sciences, the arts,
								manufactures, regulations, and principles of Egypt, and of the
								Eastern nations, were known, and partly adopted by the Greeks, from
								whom the Romans received their improvements; and we have recovered
								many, which were in use among the ancients, after they had been long
								neglected. From Chaldea and from Egypt two remarkable systems
								branched out, the one over India, China, and the extremities of the
								East, and the second over the West and North. Here and there we are
								still able to discover some remains; but in the interior Southern
								parts of Africa, and over the whole continent of America, few, if
								any, traces of those ancient systems, have been discovered. The more
								a tribe or nation preserved of the ancient systems, and modified and
								adapted them to their particular situation, climate and other
								circumstances, or raised new ideas and principles upon the first
								base or foundation, the more improved, civilized and happy must that
								tribe or nation be. The more a nation or tribe has forgotten or lost
								of the ancient systems; their situation, climate, and other
								circumstances, having obliged them to neglect or to depart from them
								without making up the defect by new principles and ideas, founded on
								the same plan, the more that nation or tribe is found to be
								degenerated, debased, and wretched. Various circumstances may have
								caused the loss and neglect of the ideas and improvements of the
								system, which their progenitors or mother-tribe still preserved; a
								number of men are obliged for instance, on account of intestine
								feuds in a nation, to abandon their native-country, and the climate
								wherein they were born and educated, in order to place themselves
								beyond the reach either of the power or outrage of their enemies;
								they wander over a great space of unoccupied ground, which is
								situated in a colder climate, than that which they formerly
								inhabited; the tropical fruits which grew in their native country
								spontaneously, are no longer to be met with; the roots, which there,
								by slight cultivation, gave them abundance of food, require here a
								very laborious and toilsome husbandry, before they yield the bare
								necessaries of life; because vegetation is not so luxuriant, so
								rapid, and powerful in climates, remote from the sun. Let us now
								suppose this clan, grown by length of time into a nation; new
								divisions supervening, force another portion, still further from the
								benevolent influence of the sun, where they find none of the
								spontaneous tropical fruits, where even the roots, their former
								support, will not thrive, on account of the rigours of their
								winters, they lose therefore, at once, their subsistence; and though
								they were obliged, in their former country, to toil during a stated
								time, they had, however, the satisfaction of collecting a certain
								food; but now, unacquainted as they are, with the spontaneous
								productions of this new climate, which might, perhaps, supply them
								with eatables, they must roam over their new country in quest of
								precarious food; they try to kill by force or address, some animals
								or birds or to catch some fish in the rivers or seas, to procure a
								subsistence; this entirely alters their mode of living; their
								habits, their language, and I might almost say their nature; their
								ideas are quite changed, the improvements, which they had in their
								former situation, are neglected and lost; the tree, from which they
								formerly made their garments, grows not in this new climate; their
								retreat was so precipitate, that they had not time to take some
								plants or shoots with them, nor any of the domesticated animals,
								whose skins afforded them garments in their former country: they
								however, find themselves under the necessity of procuring some
								covering to screen their bodies against the rigours of the climate,
								and the inclemencies of wind and rain, to which they must now be
								more exposed than in their former situation, their mode of living
								being quite altered. They find some grass, or the filaments of some
								other plant, or the skins of birds and seals, to answer this
								purpose, and they use them accordingly; their rambling way of life,
								in quest of food, obtained by the chase or fishing, obliges them to
								change their abode as often as the game becomes scarce, or the fish
								less numerous; they think it therefore not worth their while to
								build neat, large, and convenient houses; a temporary hut, just
								sufficient to screen them from the keen winds and the frequent
								showers of rain, snow, and hail, is erected by them, in every new
								place to which they remove. The fathers retain perhaps the names and
								ideas of things, which they enjoyed in their former situation; their
								children lose the idea, and the third or fourth generation, forget
								even the names by which they are called; the new objects, which they
								find and begin to use, oblige them to invent new names for them, and
								for the manner in which they are employed; and thus even the
								language becomes altered; nay, their way of subsisting, by the chace
								or fishing, obliges them to live in small tribes, distant from
								others , in order to facilitate their subsistence. Formerly, when
								moderate husbandry and the spontaneous growth of fine fruits in a
								happy climate, enabled numerous tribes to live close together, they
								then enjoyed more leisure for social life, they had the advantage of
								being mutually and powerfully assisted, and they communicated their
								improvements to each other: now they are deprived of the charms and
								choice of society, which is confined to the few individuals of a
								family, or a small tribe; they are destitute of any assistance or
								protection from their friends; exposed to the fierceness of
								rapacious animals, perhaps to the barbarity of some other tribe of
								savages; incapable of undertaking any work which requires the united
								efforts of multitude; they make no other improvements, but those
								which their narrow understanding comprehends, and is capable of;
								there being less chance of meeting with a man of genius, in a small,
								than in a greater number of human beings. Constantly intent upon the
								means of procuring the necessaries of life, especially food, every
								other pursuit, every other knowledge is neglected, and the ideas
								therefore, which are not connected with the chace or fishery, are
								absolutely lost to this race of men. They must therefore of course,
								by degrees, degenerate into a debased forlorn condition, and all the
								notions of improvements, the work of ages, and the result of the
								reason and the wits of thousands be forgotten; their reason, for
								want of being exercised, is at last brought so low, that nothing but
								the mere ideas of animal life, the instincts of brute creation
								remain; strangers to social feelings, and still more so to social
								virtues, they herd together by custom; sensuality,7 and the
								enjoyment of the few wants of nature, make the whole field of their
								brutish desires; and of that bright image of divinity, of expanded
								and sublime knowledge, of the consciousness of good and virtuous
								actions, of the noble and generous struggle in the cause of virtue
								and social happiness, hardly a few sparks remain.</p><p n="361">If we were to sum up the arguments, and evidence which we ought to
								collect from the above facts, it is certain, that on one side the
								mildness of the climate contributes greatly to soften the manners of
								mankind; and the rigours of the extremities of our globe, renders
								the fibres and whole frame of our bodies more harsh, rigid, and
								insensible, which undoubtedly operates upon the mind, and the heart,
								and almost totally destroys all social feelings; on the other side
								we find, that the influence of the climate far from being the only
								cause of the degeneracy of mankind on the extremities of our globe,
								evidently points us out the second great cause of degeneracy of the
								human race, the want of education, by which means the most useful
								notions, tending to improve our physical, mental, moral, and social
								faculties, are propagated, perpetuated, and lastly increased by new
								additional ideas.</p><p n="362">Before I conclude this chapter, I beg leave to add a few
								reflections.</p><p n="363">We have represented the savages living on the frozen extremities of
								our globe, as most debased, degenerated, and wretched: and it is
								nevertheless certain, that though their condition appear to us
								forlorn, and they themselves be in our eyes the outcast of the human
								species; they do not think so meanly of their own situation; nay, so
								far from supposing themselves unhappy; they rather glory in the
								advantages of their way of living, and none of them would exchange
								his cold climate for one that is more temperate, his wretched hut
								for a comfortable European house, nay, not even for the most
								magnificent palace; he thinks his piece of seals-skin a more
								becoming dress than the best silks and brocades; nor would he prefer
								a well-seasoned ragout to a piece of stinking seals flesh.8 To be
								controuled by wise laws and regulations, is what the spirit of some
								of these rambling barbarians could never brook; and independence,
								licentiousness, and revenge their favourite passions, render them
								absolutely unfit for any well-regulated society, and cause in them a
								general contempt for our way of living, where order and
								subordination take place. They think themselves happy, nay, happier
								than the best regulated nation, and every individual of them is so
								perfectly contented with his condition, that not even a wish is left
								in his breast for the least alteration.*<ref target="#jf117"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf117">* This is applicable to the savages of Tierra del Fuego, and the barbarians of New Zeeland: but the inhabitants of O-Taheitee and the Society Isles, are beyond this state. None of the first two races of men, upon the offer being made to them, shewed any desire to go with us to our own country; and there are already seven or eight instances, to my knowledge, of persons from the latter isles, who willingly offered to go with us to Europe.9</note></ref></p><p n="364">But a mind accustomed to meditation, and able to affix to every thing
								its true value, must certainly perceive, that this situation of the
								savage or barbarian, is nothing more than a state of intoxication;
								his happiness and contentment founded on mere sensuality is
								transitory and delusive; the sum of all his enjoyments is so small,
								so defective in its particulars, and of so little value, that a man
								in his senses cannot but think himself happy that he was born in a
								civilized nation, educated in a country where society is as much
								improved as is possible; that he belongs to a people who are
								governed by the mildest laws, and have the happiest constitution of
								government, being under the influence of civil and religious
								liberty.</p><p n="365">If therefore the happiness of the savage is not so eligible, as some
								philosophers will make us believe, who never viewed mankind in this
								debased situation; it is certainly the wish of humanity, and of real
								goodness, to see all these nations brought nearer to a more
								improved, more civilized, and more happy state, without the addition
								of these evils, which abuses, luxury and vice have introduced among
								our societies. Human nature is capable of great improvements, if men
								only knew how to proceed in order to effectuate this great and noble
								purpose. The greater part of them are too unreasonable in their
								wishes, too rapid and violent in their proceedings, and too sanguine
								in their expectations. They wish this change should take place
								immediately, their methods for bringing it about are contrary to
								human nature, and sometimes they overlook the progress of
								improvement, because it is slow. If we consider the progress of man
								as an individual, from birth to manhood, we find it very slow and
								gradual, though ever so much care be taken to improve the body, as
								well as the intellectual and the moral faculties, and to instill
								early into the mind the seeds of social virtue. We can never pass
								over the years of childhood, and youth, and make infants men; not
								even by the most accomplished education. Thus likewise, the approach
								towards civilization, must be left to time; it is a work of ages to
								bring the mind of a whole nation to maturity. Nor can it be forced
								or accelerated by the best instructions. From animality nations
								ripen into savages, from this state they enter into that of
								barbarism, before they are capable of civilization, and how many
								degrees of refinement does not even this situation admit?</p><p n="366">Infancy is in individuals, merely animal life. In the same manner the
								lowest degree of degeneration in collective bodies is animality.
								Childhood is undesigning, harmless, and innocent; private property
								and personal security of others, are ideas which the boy is to be
								taught when he emerges from infancy, for he knows of no other law
								than that of the strongest. The savage has likewise no idea of the
								personal security of any other besides himself, nor thinks better in
								regard to private property: he kills where he is the strongest, and
								he robs where he cannot otherwise obtain the possession of what he
								covets. Adolescence is the age of violent passions, breaking out in
								outrages against all the principles of morality; carrying away like
								an impetuous flood whatever opposes its desires: the youth has the
								dawning of understanding and reason, and if the mental faculties are
								not improved in this stage, and the passions made subservient to
								reason, he degenerates into profligacy, and brings on his own ruin.
								The barbarian is likewise fiery and violent, without controul and
								principles, nay, capable of the most detestable outrages; nations in
								this state want education and improvement more than in any other.
								Manhood and a mature age, are similar to the civilized state, and
								have therefore several degrees.10</p><p n="367">These remarks will give a general outline of the real condition of
								these nations, of the improvements which philosophers can with
								propriety wish for them, and of the progress they may be expected to
								have made from the little intercourse with Europeans. I have been
								frequently asked, what improvements and progress in civilization the
								inhabitants of the islands in the South Sea appeared to me to have
								made since Europeans came among them. A few years in regard to a
								nation, are a few moments in a man's life, a man may learn very
								useful things materially affecting his situation in life in a few
								hours; but it would be next to impossible to point out in his
								character, his mode of living, his conversation, and his actions a
								few hours after this acquisition, the advantages he can or will
								derive from thence; this holds likewise in regard to nations; a few
								years cannot bring on a material change among them. We carried hogs
								and fowls to New Zeeland; and dogs and pigs to New Caledonia, dogs
								to Tanna, Mallicollo, and the Friendly Isles, and goats to
								O-Taheitee; these animals will no doubt in time cause a material
								change in the way of living of these nations; but as we could give
								no more than one couple of goats and a few of the other species of
								animals, it will require a succession of years before they can
								multiply, and become so numerous, that every inhabitant may have
								several of them, and thus be enabled to employ them in food. The use
								of iron tools is another article, which would, in time, become a
								great improvement to their mechanical employments; but as those
								tools which we procured for them were by no means in sufficient
								number, that every man might be provided with a compleat set, the
								changes which they have produced, are, as yet, very inconsiderable;
								nay, as these isles have no productions, which might tempt any
								European nation to set on foot a regular and constant navigation to
								them; it is probable, that in a few years they will be entirely
								neglected; if therefore the iron tools imported, had been so
								numerous, that every man could have had his share, the natives would
								have entirely laid aside their own stone hatchets, stone chissels,
								and other implements, and would, perhaps, by length of time, have
								forgotten the manner of making them. This circumstance, must of
								course, have become very distressing to them; used to our tools,
								without possessing the art of making them, or the still greater art
								of procuring iron, from whence they might be manufactured, and
								having laid aside and forgotten the method of forming their
								substitutes of stone, they would, instead of being improved, have
								been thrown back several ages in their own improvements. We did not
								communicate intellectual, moral, or social improvements to the
								natives of the isles; nor could these be expected from the crew of a
								man of war; those who might be deemed capable of enlarging their
								minds with new ideas relative to science, arts and manufactures, of
								instilling the principles of true morality and virtue into their
								breasts, or of communicating to them notions of a well regulated
								government, and diffusing throughout a numerous nation, that spirit
								of charity, attachment, and disinterested love of the community,
								which ought to glow in the breast of every reasonable member of
								society, had neither time nor leisure for such an undertaking in the
								few days of our abode among them, especially as none had a thorough
								knowledge of the several languages, and as each had a different
								pursuit to attend, which had been delegated to him by his superiors,
								when this expedition was set on foot.</p></div><div type="chapter" n="24" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head><l>SECTION V</l><l>Food, and the Method of Procuring it, by Fishing,

								with which we became acquainted.</p><p n="369">We observed in general, that the chief occupation of all the nations,
								which live towards the extremities of our globe, consists in
								procuring their subsistence; all their endeavours, contrivances and
								ingenuity, center in this great and necessary object: cloathing,
								habitation, security, liberty, property, and every other concern
								must give way to the first.</p><p n="370">If we compare the situation of the inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego,
								and of the Eskimaux, or Greenlanders, every circumstance proves the
								latter superior to the inhabitants of the South extremity of
								America, though these have, in many respects, the advantage of them
								in regard to the gifts which nature has bestowed on their
								country.</p><p n="371">The Greenlanders and Eskimaux can procure a variety of food, chiefly
								of the animal kind, from land and sea animals. They hunt equally
								rein dears and whales; kill seals and sea fowl, and likewise catch
								fish, especially salmon: but the wretched Pesserai is obliged to
								subsist chiefly on muscles and other shell fish, which he collects
								by means of a bone hook fixed on a long octangular pole, from the
								bottom of the sea, and from the rocks under water. We saw the
								Pesserais eat rotten seal's flesh, and they presented it to us as a
								great rarity; but though we examined the whole extent of
								Christmas-Bay in more than one boat, we never saw any seals. It is
								therefore probable, that they are either very scarce in this part,
								of that they occasionally migrate to other places, and return to the
								sound at certain seasons. One man among them had a piece of a
								guanacoes-skin for his clothing,2 but amongst thirty or forty, whom
								we saw, he was the only one. Christmas-Harbour seems to have none of
								these animals, as its lands consist of small barren isles, without
								any woods or grassy places, which might afford food and shelter for
								these animals, and the summits of the hills were at the end of
								December entirely covered with immense masses of snow. It is
								therefore highly probable, that those Pesserais whom we saw there,
								remove to other places, where the guanacoes are found. Farther to
								the East, on Tierra del Fuego which consists of a large mass of
								land, without being divided into so many small islands; we and other
								navigators observed large woods of fine timber, and extensive plains
								covered with grass, and if any guanacoes are to be met with on
								Tierra del Fuego, it must be there;*<ref target="#jf118"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf118">* The Dutch navigators in the Nassau fleet, found some animals on Tierra del Fuego, which they called a kind of deer; but they are probably the guanacoes, common on the neighbouring continent. See Recueil des Voyages faits pour l'Etablissement de la Comp. des Indes Orientales, vol. iv.</note></ref> but perhaps those animals are
								only to be found on the American continent. Our Pesserais therefore,
								in one or the other case, go to the continent, or to the Eastern
								regions of this great cluster of numerous isles. This however,
								proves that they change their abode, and transport themselves to
								very distant places, in order to procure their food, and likewise
								implies that they are much distressed for the means of procuring it;
								for they would certainly not remove, if they could provide at all
								times and seasons a sufficiency at the place of their abode. We did
								not observe that the Pesserais ever used the berries of a kind of
								arbutus, which, in some places, is found in great abundance; nor can
								we recollect that they made use of any other vegetables by way of
								food, though it is probable that they do not entirely neglect them.
								On the contrary, the inhabitants of Greenland gather several kinds
								of berries to live upon, and likewise eat a kind of sea-weed.</p><p n="372">The Pesserais whom we saw, were without any other covering than that
								of a small piece of seal-skin, or a part of a guanacoe-skin, hung
								over their backs, and seemed not the least concerned upon exposing
								their genitals; the women had only a piece of white birds skin about
								six inches square, hardly sufficient to be called a badge of
								modesty; nor was this custom universal, for some of them were seen
								without it. The Greenlanders on the contrary, are all well provided
								with seal-skins, rein-deer-furrs and skins of water-birds; and these
								skins are further improved into a kind of convenient dress, well
								suited to the rigours of their winters; nay, they use the guts of
								certain fish and animals for under garments, or as we would call it
								instead of shirts and shifts; they formerly employed bones of fish
								and birds instead of needles, and they split the sinews of the
								rein-deer and whale, in order to use them instead of thread, which
								they handle with so much dexterity and neatness, that even our
								European furriers admire their skill. They are not contented with
								one set of cloaths, but on solemn occasions are provided with new
								suits.</p><p n="373">Their habitations are adapted to each season; in winter they occupy
								warm and convenient houses, built of stone, and covered with beams,
								and a roof, though wood be very scarce among them, as they have no
								other than what is drifted to their shores, and thrown up by sea;
								they have windows for admitting day-light, made very curiously of
								seals guts, and maws of fish; the whole inside is hung with skins,
								and their elevated bed-places are covered with the finest furrs; and
								the entrance is contrived in a convenient and ingenious manner.
								Their method of dressing victuals, over a lamp of train-oil, in a
								kettle of pot-stone; and in a word, all their contrivances are
								proofs of their skill and ingenuity; their greater happiness, and
								their enjoyment of the lowest degree of conveniences. The summer
								they pass in neat and convenient tents, regularly built of poles,
								and covered with skins, with a transparent skin hung before the
								entrance, which admits light, and excludes the wind, rain, and cold.
								The poor Pesserais, on the contrary, wherever they are driven by
								necessity and hunger, have no other shelter than a few poles stuck
								in the ground, or small trees, which they find on the spot, tied
								together by leather straps or bast, and a few bundles of brush-wood
								fixed over them, by way of covering, all of which is encompassed by
								some old seals-skins; this kind of hut is open at least one fifth or
								sixth part of the whole circumference, and in this opening the fire
								is made, so that they remain exposed to the inclemencies of the
								weather, and to the rigors of the climate, which was far from being
								mild in the height of their summer. Notwithstanding all this, it
								appeared to me to be very singular, that a people, having a great
								quantity of the finest wood, should be so much at a loss, to make
								their situation a little more comfortable, by employing this timber,
								in building with it more convenient houses, and stronger boats. It
								cannot be said that they have no contrivance for cutting and shaping
								the wood to various purposes, because the poles, to which they fix
								their bone shell-hooks, are ten or twelve feet long, perfectly
								strait, smooth and octangular, which, in my opinion, evidently
								proves their skill in shaping wood; the same observation may be
								applied in regard to their cloathing; they have seal-skins, fox and
								guanacoe furrs; I saw that they had sewed parts of their seal-skins
								or guanacoe-skin cloaks, with sinews or small leather thongs, and
								yet they were not ingenious enough to carry this invention of sewing
								one step farther, by shaping their skins in such a manner, that they
								might shelter them against the inclemencies of their rigourous
								climate; these particulars strongly indicate the wretchedness and
								debased condition of these people. This miserable and forlorn
								condition of the poor Pesserais, appeared dreadful to us, who were
								accustomed to the conveniences of a civilized life: but habit,
								together with indolence and stupidity, render these hardships
								supportable; and they have hardly an idea that their situation can
								be improved; unless we believe that their indolence alone is so
								great, as to check even the least progress towards the enjoyment of
								greater and more desirable conveniencies; they seem to be the
								victims of the revenge or insolence of a more powerful tribe, who
								drove them to this inhospitable Southern extremity of the great
								American continent. All the nations found by the first European
								discovery, on the immense continent of America, were savages, just
								removed one degree from animality, rambling in the vast connected
								forests of this land, in small tribes: they all had very little
								clothing, and lived chiefly upon the produce of fishing, or the
								chace. Only two nations had a kind of civilization, and they lived
								within the tropics, and their improvements and progress towards a
								civilized state, were, according to their own historical monuments,
								of a modern date, and probably imported by a few families, whom
								chance, or cruel necessity, had thrown on these wild and
								inhospitable shores.</p><p n="374">These considerations lead us to some natural inferences, viz. that as
								the number of inhabitants on the great American continent, was, in
								general very inconsiderable, their state far remote from
								civilization, and bordering upon animality; the rigors of the
								climate, on its extremities severe; the food for human beings very
								precarious; those men who are found on these extremities, certainly
								came from more happy and more civilized regions, and that only
								necessity could make the hardships supportable, which they of course
								must undergo: that the more wretched and forlorn their situation is,
								the stronger it proves, that the nation or tribe, of which they are
								descended, had already, in part, lost the principles of education,
								common to all happy nations, whom we generally find within the
								tropics; they must likewise be few in number, because they are
								descended from a straggling tribe, and are themselves not very
								prolific, owing perhaps to the want of natural heat, the harshness
								of their fibres, the poverty of their juices, and other causes,
								which are the consequences of their mode of living, and of the
								constitution of their climate. The great Mr. de Montesquieu*<ref target="#jf119"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf119">* Montesquieu Esprit de Loix, book 23, chap. xiii.</note></ref> was of
								opinion, that the nations feeding chiefly on fish, were the most
								prolific, because the greasy, oily, particles of fish, seem to
								supply more of that substance which nature secretes for the purposes
								of generation, than any other kind of food.3 This singular opinion,
								though retailed by many sensible copiers,=<ref target="#jf120"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf120">= De Saintfoix Essais Historiques sur Paris, tom. ii. p. 181.</note></ref> is not founded in nature,
								or confirmed by experience. In Greenland,×<ref target="#jf121"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf121">× Crantz's History of Greenland, vol. i. p. 161.</note></ref> and among the Eskimaux,F<ref target="#jf122"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf122">F Lieut. Curtis, in the Philos. Trans. vol. lxiv. part ii. p. 385.</note></ref>
								where the natives live chiefly on fish, seals, and oily animal
								substances, the women seldom bear children oftener than three or
								four times; five or six births are reckoned a very extraordinary
								instance. The Pesserais, whom we saw, had not above two or three
								children belonging to each family, though their common food
								consisted of muscles, fish, and seals-flesh. The New-Zeelanders
								absolutely feed on fish, and yet no more than three or four children
								were found in the most prolific families; which seems strongly to
								indicate, that feeding on fish by no means contributes to the
								increase of numbers in a nation, but that there are other causes
								concurring, which promote population.</p><p n="375">From the preceding arguments, it appears that the Pesserais are
								wretched on account of the inhospitality of their climate, and
								because they are descended from a degenerated race, and become the
								remote offspring of such happy tribes as are still possessed of the
								remains of the original system of education, of which little or
								nothing passed over with them into Tierra del Fuego.</p><p n="376">Wherever we find nations or tribes in nearer or more immediate
								connexion, with those who had still the system of useful ideas,
								perpetuated by education, we likewise find the human species, as it
								were, in more vigour, and better civilization. The ancient Mexicans
								and Peruvians seem to be descended from those nations, whom
								Kublaikhan sent to conquer Japan, and who were dispersed by a
								dreadful storm, and it is probable that some of them were thrown on
								the coast of America, and there formed these two great empires. The
								Greenlanders and Eskimaux, in the very North of America, came later
								into that continent than any of the other American nations (the
								Mexicans and Peruvians excepted), for they are reckoned to be a
								foreign tribe, and they appear to be of a different race of men, by
								the language, the dress, the features, size, form and habit of body,
								and manners: probably they came from some of the numerous isles,
								which form the connexion between America and Asia. All these nations
								had better regulations and principles than their neighbours, and
								human nature seems with them to have been in more vigour, than with
								the rest of the American savage tribes; their later connexions with,
								and descent from Asiatic nations, accounts for the remaining ideas
								of arts and principles of social life, and of civilization; and
								likewise for the laws, regulations and form of government introduced
								among them; but the Pesserais are in a quite different condition:
								for being descended from the straggling American tribes who
								themselves were much degenerated, they could not derive from them
								any idea of education, or any principles of social life, nor any
								regulations approaching to those which are usually to be met with,
								in civilized nations.</p><p n="377">We may add to this, that their numbers are few, and that though their
								country be very little inferior in size to one moiety of Ireland,
								hardly 2000 inhabitants are found on this great extent of land.</p><p n="378">In these small wild tribes, it is almost certain, that the still
								smaller societies, whom navigators have occasionally found, were
								nearly related to one another; which makes it probable, that they
								only keep together because they still find some benefit from their
								union and mutual assistance; and this makes the Europeans, who are
								used to civil society, believe, that the ties of friendship and
								blood still unite them; but it is quite otherwise, for it is not the
								interest of savages to form great bodies, in countries that are not
								rich in food and animal productions; as soon as they think
								themselves strong enough to set up a new family, they separate and
								remove to parts unoccupied by other families, where they have a
								prospect of supporting their wives and children, and perhaps a few
								younger brethren or sisters. This evidently points out the true
								cause of the debasement and degeneracy in savages; they can neither
								profit by the assistance, nor by the inventions and improvements of
								others, and the smallness of their numbers affords but a bad chance
								for a multiplicity of inventions or improvements. The instructions
								and good advice of long experience are lost to them, and the
								constant necessity of procuring a precarious food for the family,
								robs them of that leisure, which is necessary for instruction, and a
								more finished education. As soon as their numbers increase, that the
								country can no more feed the inhabitants, they must of course either
								oppress and expel, or kill others, in order to occupy their fishing
								and hunting places; or they are obliged to migrate to an unoccupied
								country; or they must devise new methods of procuring food with ease
								for their increased numbers. Seldom is their indolence conquered to
								that degree, that they migrate or become industrious, and find out a
								new kind of food, and a new way of living. Oppression is commonly
								represented to their minds as the easiest and surest method, they
								therefore dislodge their neighbours, or put them to death, and take
								their wives and children for their slaves and drudges. Thus grown
								elated with success, and powerful by extent of land, and enjoying
								those advantages, which supply them with the means of supporting
								themselves with greater ease, and making life somewhat more
								comfortable; they endeavour to extend their dominion, and every
								success enables them to emerge more and more from that state of
								debasement in which they were plunged; or if they should be opposed,
								checked, and even routed in the attempt, they will certainly be
								prompted to exert themselves again, that they may not lose that
								superiority which they had once attained; or they will study to make
								the misfortunes which their ambition had drawn upon them, less
								consequential, and to avert the miseries which otherwise would fall
								upon them. All this of course rouses their minds from that indolence
								and inactivity with which they were oppressed, and they in every
								respect conquer somewhat of that degeneracy to which they were
								reduced: for the human mind, left to itself in a continued course of
								uniformity either in happiness or wretchedness, has very little
								exertion; but add to it the springs of passions, which are most
								powerful in such tribes as are least improved in their mental
								faculties, and we shall find it amazing to what length they may
								carry a set of men, who lend no ear to any principles of morality,
								and who adjust their notions of rectitude by the extent of power
								only. Though naturally this principle cannot carry them very far,
								because they must sooner or later meet with a powerful opposition,
								from the united efforts of such tribes as will not lose their
								liberty; it has however, in general the benefit of communicating to
								all the tribes a willingness to exert themselves, to unite the
								interest of more families against the oppression of others, and to
								give them that dawning of civil society, which is alone the great
								improver and preserver of human happiness, in its physical, moral,
								and social sense.</p><p n="379">If therefore the savages by an happy exertion of their physical and
								mental powers, rise one step higher in the class of rational beings,
								their situation no doubt, becomes upon the whole more improved; but
								at the same time this very state, though more vigorous and more
								active, often breaks out into such enormities, as make the heart
								ache, and are humiliating to human nature. New Zeeland offers us an
								instance of this assertion: whosoever casts an eye upon them with a
								view to compare their situation with that of the Pesserais, no doubt
								will allow that of the New-Zeelanders to be greatly preferable in
								every respect. They inhabit a milder climate both by situation and
								temperature, which has softened the fibres and organs, and taken off
								that rigour which certainly influences the mental and moral
								faculties of the Pesserais, by narrowing their minds, and
								brutalizing their feelings. From this somewhat less constricted and
								harsh state of their organization, their minds have acquired a
								larger and more liberal circle of ideas, improved by a greater
								population, and the advantages arising from thence by mutual
								assistance, improvements, instruction, advice, and education; their
								minds are bold and fearless. They are not without acuteness to
								comprehend sound reason, and not without docility in adopting such
								ideas and informations as are necessary and eligible in their
								situation. This has convinced them of the necessity and convenience
								of mutual attachments, and the propriety of forming larger
								societies, in order to preserve their liberty and independence; and
								as their actions are guided by violent passions, it is no wonder
								that we find among barbarous nations instances of fidelity and
								friendship, carried on with an enthusiasm, which would do honour to
								the most civilized nations, nay, which are hardly to be met with in
								a superior degree, in this age of refinement; unless we look for it
								into poems and romances, in the district of fiction and fable. Their
								principles of honesty, and public faith are noble, and romantic; but
								as they are jealous of their liberty and independence, the least
								thing is construed by them into offence, and they are too often
								ready to revenge an imaginary injury. Strangers especially are
								looked upon as persons to whom less forbearance is due than to their
								own friends. The wild notions of independence degenerated into
								licentiousness, arm their minds with an intrepedity, which would be
								meritorious, were it used only on real provocation; but they work
								themselves up into a frantic madness, run into the most eminent
								dangers, and fight with a perseverance, which proves that death is
								no evil which they dread. In victory they are insolent, cruel, and
								vindictive, carrying it to the most unnatural and inhuman degree,
								viz. that of feasting upon the victims of their victorious prowess.
								They treat their women in the most oppressive manner, like the most
								abject drudges, or slaves, and the parents and relations frequently
								sold to the strangers the favours of the females, even against their
								will; which circumstances certainly proceed from the injurious and
								overbearing notions entertained in regard to their women, whom they
								do not think to be helpmates, but creatures intended for the
								satisfaction of brutish desires only, and destined to confirm them
								in ideleness and indolence. This idea prevailed so far, that we
								frequently saw the little boys strike their mothers, while the
								fathers stood by and would not permit the mothers to correct their
								children.4 They have all a passion for ornaments, and dress; and
								they decorate the most common tools of husbandry or their arms, in a
								curious manner with volutes and scrolls, not altogether without
								taste. They are fond of romantic and fabulous tales, of music, songs
								and dances; even their fights are begun with a martial cadenced song
								and dance. They have some ideas of religion, and accounts of various
								invisible divinities, and a belief of the existence of the souls of
								their friends; but superstition seems not to have gained much ground
								among them, as far as we could observe. They have however, rites and
								customs peculiar to themselves, which they perform on certain
								occasions: for instance, in forming friendships and making peace, in
								announcing war and burying their dead, which last sometimes are
								sunk, it seems, in the sea. The natives of New-Zeeland, build some
								of their houses and cottages with an elegance and neatness, which
								makes them far superior to the wretched hovels of the inhabitants of
								Tierra del Fuego: for they are well covered on all sides with
								thatch, and the insides we found lined with reeds, so that they
								really had an appearance of neatness; and we sometimes saw several
								huts separated from the rest by inclosures of thatch, which I
								suppose was done with a view to screen them still more from the
								raging winds, and to shelter their fires, which are commonly made at
								the entrance of their huts. Their boats are stronger than those of
								Tierra del Fuego, and not without taste in their ornaments, nor
								without contrivance in their whole structure and shape, which, with
								the dexterous management of their paddles gives them an easy and
								swift motion. Their dress not only covers their nudities, but
								affords them shelter against the inclemencies of their climate,
								which is less vigorous in winter than that of Tierra del Fuego in
								summer: it is likewise woven with neatness, encompassed with
								borders, worked into various patterns of black, brown and white,
								ornamented on its corners with pieces of dogs-skin, and sometimes
								covered all over with patches of white and black dogs-skin, disposed
								in regular compartments. They wear over their garments a rug, made
								of the filaments of the flax-plant worked into a kind of mat, like
								thatch on its outside, which they call Kegheoa: this is so very well
								calculated to keep off the wind, the rain, and the spray of the sea,
								that it is amazing that the poor inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego,
								who must depend solely on the sea for their food, in a climate
								remarkably colder, and more boisterous than that of New-Zeeland,
								have not hitherto devised a better and more convenient use of their
								seals and guanacoes skins.</p><p n="380">The agriculture which is so well and so carefully carried on in many
								parts of the Northern island, incontestibly proves the superiority
								of the New-Zeelanders over the inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego. So
								that it might be superfluous in me to take up more time in
								multiplying the proofs of this so evident truth.</p><p n="381">It seems likewise equally obvious, that the more improved state of
								the New-Zeelanders, is owing to several causes, viz. the mildness of
								the climate, the greater population, and also that they are more
								immediately descended from such tribes as had more remains of the
								general principles of education. In the extremities of the Southern
								isle of New-Zeeland, perhaps the numbers may be only equal to those
								of the Pesserais, but being more happy in regard to the mildness of
								their climate, and the preservation of such ideas and improvements
								as were handed down to them, by their more happy and less
								degenerated ancestors; even these straggling families are, in my
								opinion, to be ranked higher in the scale of human beings.</p><p n="382">There is however one circumstance already alluded to, which seems to
								degrade them, viz. the odious and cruel custom of eating those, who
								are killed in their frequent feuds and petty wars. This has been
								represented by a late ingenious writer,*<ref target="#jf123"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf123">* Dr. Hawkesworth's Compilation, vol. iii. book ii. ch. 9.</note></ref> as originally introduced
								among the New-Zeelanders, by distress and hunger; but I cannot help
								dissenting from his opinion: for I did not find that these nations
								ever are so much distressed; they have prudence enough to provide in
								the proper season, stores of all kinds: when they catch more fish
								than they can eat, they carefully dry, and lay them up; their women
								go frequently up the hills, which are covered to an immense extent
								with fern, and dig up the roots, which they likewise dry, and
								preserve as a food to which they may have recourse, when neither
								fish nor any other kind of eatables are to be procured. We saw great
								quantities of these provisions in their huts, and frequently found
								them employed in preparing both fish and fern-roots, for the bad
								season. We were likewise told by Capt. Crozet, the friend and
								companion of the brave but unfortunate Capt. Marion; that when he
								got possession of the hippah or fortress of the New-Zeelanders, in
								the Bay of Islands, he found immense stores of dry fish, fern-roots,
								and other roots, in houses filled solely with these provisions.5 It
								seems therefore, to me, by no means probable, that a nation
								perfectly convinced of the necessity of providing against the season
								of distress, and so very careful and active in collecting stores of
								eatables, should nevertheless have been induced by necessity and
								hunger, to eat the corses of those slain in battle. Nay, we heard
								from the natives, that they never eat those, who die a natural
								death, but either sink them in the sea, or bury them under ground:
								were necessity the true cause of this custom, why should they not
								feast upon the dead who formed the same community with them? But it
								will be objected, that hunger may be allowed so far to stifle all
								sentimental feelings of humanity, that they might suffer themselves
								to satisfy its cravings upon the corse of a slain foe, but that it
								will never carry them so far as to feed upon the flesh of those who
								lived in the same society with them. How specious soever this
								objection may be, it never can persuade me that hunger will make
								these nice distinctions, in a people, who have not those tender,
								humane feelings and emotions, of which we are capable, in so highly
								civilized a state, with a refined education, and principles
								infinitely superior to theirs.*<ref target="#jf124"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf124">* If the account given in the life of Pierre Viaud is to be credited; for the credibility of which, there are the greatest reasons, founded upon the joint testimonies of several respectable persons, and of such people who had no inducement to compliment the author with their testimonies; it may serve to prove still more the enormities, to which the rage of hunger may drive some wretches; and it likewise shews, how easily the more refined feelings of humanity are overcome, by the horrors of unconquerable want.</note></ref></p><p n="383">But I had reason to believe, that all the nations of the South seas
								were formerly cannibals, even in the most happy and fertile
								climates, where they still live upon the almost spontaneous fruits,
								though their population be extremely great. The natives of Tanna
								gave us more than once to understand, that if we penetrated far into
								the country against their will, and without their permission, they
								would kill us, cut our bodies up, and eat them: when we purposely
								affected to misunderstand this last part of their story, and
								interpreted it, as if they were going to give us something good to
								eat, they convinced us by signs which could not be misinterpreted,
								that they would tear with their teeth the flesh from our arms and
								legs.6</p><p n="384">In Mallicollo, we had likewise some intimation that they were
								cannibals. The Taheiteans frequently enumerated to us isles
								inhabited by men-eaters: for instance, they said, that beyond
								Tabuamanoo is a high island called Manua, whose inhabitants "have
								but very few canoes, are ferocious, have wild and furious eyes, and
								eat men:" nay, we were at last told, that they themselves had
								formerly been Tah‚"i, i.e. men-eaters. As the inhabitants of
								New-Zeeland certainly belong to the same race of people with the
								Taheiteans, it is evident that this custom has been common to the
								whole tribe. What is still more remarkable, it seems from thence to
								follow, that the want of a sufficiency of food in this isle, which
								is less fertile than the tropical countries, cannot have occasioned
								their cannibalism, since even the inhabitants of the happy and
								fertile tropical isles were men-eaters, without being forced to it
								by distress and hunger, and we must therefore certainly be convinced
								that there must be some other cause, which originally introduced
								this unnatural custom.</p><p n="385">If we examine the whole oeconomy of their societies, we find that
								their education is the chief cause of all these enormities. The men
								train up the boys in a kind of liberty, which at last degenerates
								into licentiousness: they suffer not the mothers to strike their
								petulant, unruly, and wicked sons, for fear of breaking that spirit
								of independency, which they seem to value above all things, and as
								the most necessary qualification for their societies; this naturally
								brings on an irascibility, which, in the men, cannot brook any
								controul, action or word, that can be construed according to their
								manners and principles into an affront, or injury; inflamed by
								passion, they are impatient to wreak their vengeance: wild fancy
								paints the injury so atrocious, that it must be washed in blood;
								they know not where to stop, and being more and more incensed by the
								power of imagination, they go to battle with a loud and barbarous
								song, each feature is distorted, each limb is set in a cadenced
								motion; they brandish their destructive weapons, and stamp upon the
								ground with their feet, while the whole band join in an awful,
								tremendous groan; the song begins a new, and at last the whole troop
								is lost in frenzy and rage; they fall to, and every one fights as if
								animated by furies; and destruction and carnage await the routed
								party: whosoever falls, is murdered without mercy, and the corses of
								the slain immediately serve to glut the inhuman appetites of the
								conquerors. When the bounds of humanity are once passed, and the

								reconcile themselves to human flesh, which, according to several
								known instances,*<ref target="#jf125"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf125">* In the province of Matto-grosso, in Brazil, a woman told his Excellency Chevalier Pinto, who was then Governor, that human flesh was extremely palatable, especially if taken from a young person.

								dishes.</p><p n="386">To us, indeed, who are used to live in better regulated societies,
								where for many years backwards, anthropophagy has been in disuse, it
								is always a horrid idea, that men should eat men. But I cannot help
								observing, that this barbarism is one of the steps, by which debased
								humanity, is gradually prepared for a better state of happiness; in
								the savage state, where man is just one remove from animality,
								wherein he has no other impulse for action, than want, he soon sinks
								into stupid indolence, which more and more debases all his powers
								and faculties: but scarce have the passions begun to act as the main
								springs of human actions, when man is carried from the first
								excentric action to a second, from one enormity to another, and from
								this or that shocking scene of cruelty, barbarism and unhumanity to
								others of a higher degree: these would grow to an outrageous height,
								were it not for certain circumstances, which at last naturally put a
								total stop to those inhuman practices. If therefore barbarians, who
								still preserve the shocking custom of eating men, meet with other
								tribes that have the same barbarous custom, and are strong or active
								enough, either by chance or bravery, to check their neighbours in
								their inhuman wrongs, they will soon be sensible, that their own
								numbers must decrease by these losses; they will therefore grow more
								cautious in provoking their anger or vengeance by new outrages, and
								will gradually become sober enough to be convinced, that it is more
								reasonable to lay aside the custom of eating men, and that a living
								man is more useful than one that is dead or roasted; they in
								consequence change their unnatural cruelty into a more humane
								behaviour; though it be not quite free from injustice and interest,
								it is however, less destructive to mankind, and prepares the way to
								a more humane and benevolent scene. Or let us on the other hand
								suppose, these barbarians meet with unmerited success, and always
								rout their neighbours, as often as they take the field; these
								humiliated foes, in order to avoid their utter ruin and destruction,
								will at last offer terms of accommodation; and though their
								condition should become as abject as possible, they will prefer it
								to a greater and unavoidable evil, involving the whole ruin of their
								tribe; the conquerors will soon discover, that by preserving the
								lives of their subjected foes, they may reap considerable advantages
								from their labour and united force, which will gradually improve
								their condition, and render them more and more happy.</p><p n="387">This idea might be deemed imaginary; but upon examination, it will
								appear to be established in truth. In the Northern Isle of
								New-Zeeland, in a district of more than 90 miles, Captain Cook,
								found in his former voyage, the name of a great chief, called
								Teiratoo, to be generally acknowledged;7 and it should seem from
								thence, that the small tribes under his dominion, were either
								subdued by him and his adherents; or that they found it their
								interest, upon their own account, to acknowledge his authority, to
								become his subjects upon certain conditions, and thus to form one
								large political body, for greater security and defence; the better
								regulations, a security both of person and property, and a more
								impartial administration of justice, mentioned in the same account,
								prove beyond dispute, that from the violent state of cannibalism,
								the New-Zeelanders will soon arrive in their most populous
								districts, to a more settled and more happy state. For though the
								subjects for Teiratoo still eat men, this custom is rather kept up
								on account of the vicinity of such tribes as still retain the same
								custom, otherwise their more improved situation would hardly admit
								of it.</p><p n="388">"Denique coetera animantia in suo genere probe degunt: congregari
								videmus &amp; stare contra dissimilia: Leonum feritas inter se non
								dimicat: serpentum morsus non petit serpentes: ne maris quidem
								belluae ac pisces, nisi in diversa genera, soeviunt: at hercule!
								homini plurima ex homine sunt mala." Plin. Hist. Nat. lib. vii.
								Prooemii fine.8</p><p n="389">It is either the fault of some tribes, who are wanton, quarrelsome,
								and overbearing, when they are driven by more powerful nations, to
								such a desperate situation, that they become degenerate, and their
								offspring sinks to the lowest condition that can be intailed on
								mankind; or it is rather owing to cruel chance or accident, that
								they are brought into a forlorn state, wherein their progeny lingers
								for some time: in both cases Providence has wisely made a provision
								for preventing the perpetuity of misery and wretchedness in a
								nation, by infusing originally in the human soul, such faculties and
								powers, that when unfolded, or set in motion by unforeseen
								accidents, shall at last invigorate the minds of men, and supply
								them with the necessary means and strength for emerging from their
								debased condition, and enable them to resume gradually a higher rank
								in the scale of rational beings. The poor inhabitants of Tierra del
								Fuego, act only by instinct, by necessity and want, and in
								consequence of the accidental occurrences, which chance, or the
								natural changes of the elements and seasons throw in their way; but
								a more frequent intercourse with Europeans, or some other unforeseen
								accident, for instance, the fortuitous invention of iron, or some
								other useful metal; a discovery of the utility of some vegetable or
								tree in their climates; a new devise for catching fish, birds, and
								quadrupeds, in a more easy and expeditious manner than they have
								hitherto been accustomed to, must doubtless, sooner or later, bring
								on a revolution in their condition; new manners, new customs, a
								change of diet, of dress, weapons and utensils, must gradually
								produce a total change of their way of thinking and acting,
								introduce an alteration in their temper, facilitate the better
								regulation and security of their societies, and deliver them from
								that stupidity, torpor, and indolence with which they are now
								oppressed: for when once the mind is enlightened with new ideas, and
								new combinations, and a field opened to fancy and imagination in the
								recital of their actions, in their songs, dances, and various other
								representations; the passions, the great source of action in human
								life, will kindle in their breasts that Promethean fire, which will
								infuse strength and vigor into all the transactions of the
								community. Thus ought we to admire and adore that Providence, which,
								by the most simple means, always effects its intended purpose, and
								out of paternal care and tenderness, leaves the most degenerated
								race of men, not altogether destitute of faculties, powers, and
								means, by which they may emerge from their forlorn condition: nay,
								the very passions, which by their abuse and lawless condition, but
								too often become the causes of dangerous evils in human society, are
								employed by the wise Governor of the world, as subordinate causes,
								to forward the happiness of mankind, and to bring them gradually to
								a more mild, virtuous state, and to happiness of every kind. But at
								the same time that my most inward thoughts are prostrate in
								adoration before the great Maker and Father of the souls of all
								flesh; my heart is filled with the warmest wishes that it may please
								the alwise Providence soon to raise this brave and generous race of
								my fellow creatures from their unnatural state, to a condition,
								where humanity may characterise each action; that fellow-feeling,
								kindness, and universal charity may victoriously spread throughout
								all these barbarous nations, and restore that reverential awe due to
								man, the noblest work of God on Earth.</p><p n="390"><q><emph>- - - - - - - - Deus ille fuit - - - - - Qui princeps vitae

								clearness, and conviction, which its extensive utility, and
								interesting doctrines require, let us in a short excursion on the
								general principles of social life, and on the advantages and
								happiness, which reasonably may be expected in civilized societies,
								fix some ideas that may lead to the investigation of this great and
								interesting doctrine.</p><p n="395">Man, such as he every where is, has a strong desire of being as happy
								as his circumstances will admit. The natural and most pressing
								wants, soon convince him that he cannot enjoy by himself even a
								moderate share of happiness; and that uniting with other human
								beings, is the most effectual means, not only of procuring the
								greatest degree of happiness possible in his situation; but also of
								insuring to him with certainty, an undisturbed enjoyment of it. He
								will soon be sensible that his own happiness procured by the
								assistance of the united efforts of other human beings, depend
								likewise upon their happiness; for no one who is doomed to be under
								continual pain, or overwhelmed with misery, will sincerely endeavour
								to contribute to the satisfaction of another, if he finds himself
								more wretched upon every effort to increase the happiness of his
								fellow creature. It must therefore be the interest of each
								individual who wishes to be happy, to promote the prosperity of the
								whole community to which he belongs; and from whom he expects acts
								of reciprocal kindness, that may tend to improve his own happiness.
								The happiness of every human being living in a society, depends upon
								the following principles.</p><p n="396">First, Man has an organic body, requiring food, habitation, and
								dress, as means conducive to its support; and many other things
								necessary, in order to acquire these articles without great labour
								and peril, or in other words, to make life more agreeable and easy;
								these we would call the principles of physical happiness.</p><p n="397">Secondly, Man is likewise a rational, thinking, and freely acting
								being; his happiness therefore requires that he be able to procure
								the means of improving his intellectual faculties by instruction,
								and to preserve the rights and privileges of a free agency, which
								however, ought to be directed by charity and benevolence towards the
								promotion of his own happiness, and that of his fellow creatures. In
								a word, he ought to be enabled to live in a manner becoming the
								dignity of a rational and free being; and from thence we may collect
								the principles of moral happiness.</p><p n="398">Lastly, As he is become together with others, a member of a
								community, with a view to the promotion of mutual happiness; he
								expects to derive from this union or society the means of enjoying
								with certainty, in a perfect and undisturbed manner his physical and
								moral happiness. Herein consist the principles of civil or social
								felicity.</p><p n="399">From hence it becomes evident, that whenever men are found to live in
								societies for the promotion of mutual happiness, they ought to enjoy
								physical, moral and social felicity in the highest degree possible,
								in their situation and circumstances.</p><p n="400">But besides the abovementioned division of happiness we must allow,
								that it naturally must have many degrees, depending on the following
								circumstances.</p><p n="401">First, The more various and multiplied the objects of physical,
								moral, and social enjoyment are, which a man or a whole society
								really can make their own, the greater must their happiness be; and
								on the other hand, the fewer and the less varied the enjoyments, and
								objects of enjoyment are, the more circumscribed and small is their
								happiness.</p><p n="402">Secondly, The longer the duration of enjoyments of a man or society
								of men is, the happier they will find themselves: and the more
								fleeting and transitory their enjoyments are, in the same degree,
								must they experience unhappiness.</p><p n="403">Thirdly, The more extensive and general the influence of all the
								enjoyment of a man or a society, is in regard to their physical,
								moral and social felicity, the more their happiness must be
								increased; and on the contrary, if their enjoyments have no effect
								or influence upon their own happiness, or that of others, then
								indeed it hardly deserves the name of happiness, or it is at least
								very inconsiderable.</p><p n="404">By these few principles are we enabled to judge, with a tolerable
								degree of precision, of the happiness and civilization of the
								nations we met with in the course of our voyage; especially if we
								have a retrospect to the causes which promote felicity, and which
								hinder the same, or at least check its progress and more rapid
								increase.</p><p n="405">For when men live in a genial climate, and enjoy the advantages of a
								happy organization, nature seems to do every thing vigorously, in
								promoting their happiness. Thus we see the early improvements,
								grandeur and happiness of the Assyrian and Egyptian empires; their
								climate is one of the mildest and most temperate; its inhabitants,
								even in their present degenerated, barbarous state, are endowed with
								a lively temper, and quick parts; nor are they destitute of
								good-nature and benevolence: no wonder, therefore, that ancient
								history is so copious on the state of their population, wealth,
								opulence, and happiness, which cannot be controverted, as the vast
								monuments and stupendous buildings of these nations are still
								subsisting, and witness the truth of their historians.</p><p n="406">In climates nearly approaching the mild temperature of the former,
								the inhabitants are blessed with an organization proportioned to the
								softness of their climate, though probably descended from tribes
								that came from more rigid climates, and had been less happy in the
								preservation of the original systems of education; among these,
								national felicity could not be brought about with success, without
								the assistance of art. Cecrops, Triptolemus, Theseus, Solon,
								Pisistratus, Miltiades and Aristides,3 were the men, who, by art,
								assisted nature in Attica, and it required the efforts of the best
								and wisest men, during a space of 1130 years, before the Athenians
								could attain that pitch of happiness under Pericles, which made
								their empire the most respectable and happy in the contemporary
								civilized part of the world.</p><p n="407">In climates still more unfavourable and rigid, not only the
								assistance of art, but that of creative physical power, as well as
								that of creative genius, is required to insure the happiness of the
								inhabitants, whose fibres had contracted a congenial roughness and
								rigidity, and who are continually subject to numberless checks and
								hindrances, to every improvement leading to national felicity. Such
								was the power and genius of Peter the Great; who, in half a century,
								raised his nation from indolence, barbarism, and stupidity, to that
								degree of happiness and grandeur, which it now enjoys under the mild
								and benevolent legislation of Catharine the Great.</p><p n="408">Such likewise are the various gradations of the happiness of the
								inhabitants of the South-Sea Islands; some have attained, in the
								course of nature, a degree of felicity, which is proportioned to
								their situation and condition; others are behind-hand in
								improvements and happiness, and can never attain it, unless nature
								be assisted by human art; in others, again, a whole new creation is
								required, to procure and to insure them that happiness which would
								set them upon a level with the first mentioned happy tribes. There
								are besides, so many concurring circumstances, that either promote
								or retard national felicity, that it is impossible, either to
								enumerate them all, or to describe the various hues of happiness
								arising from their different combinations. This, however, may be
								added to the former observations, that too great irritability, or
								too great rigidity of the human organization, equally oppose the
								progress of improvements and social felicity; the one causes a
								restless, passionate temper, in a fervent climate; the other creates
								stupidity, dullness and indolence, in the rigid and cold regions,
								found at the two polar extremities of our globe: and how difficult
								it is to conquer either the one or the other, may be easily proved
								from the hitherto fruitless attempts in civilizing the negroes of
								our plantations, or the Greenlanders and Laplanders of the North. I
								will not, however, deny, that perhaps the most proper means have not
								hitherto been employed, in bringing this difficult undertaking, even
								so far, that a rational probability of a very distant success, might
								be expected. The above-mentioned articles form the point of view,
								under which we now would wish every body to consider the more
								civilized state of the tropical nations in the South-Seas.</p><p n="409">We found the isles in the South-Sea very populous; and from the
								accounts of former navigation, they were so, more than 180 years
								ago, and in the very condition, in regard to happiness, in which we
								ourselves observed them; so that we may be sure, that their civil or
								social establishment is of a long standing.</p><p n="410">It is hardly credible, that the inhabitants were very numerous when
								they first occupied these isles; but the ease and facility with
								which they can support their lives, and satisfy the natural and most
								pressing wants, the early puberty in so mild and so happy a climate,
								the few diseases which are observed in nations used to a simple and
								salubrious food, are certainly reasons for supposing that they soon
								increased, and gradually filled the islands which they had occupied.
								--- The first inhabitants had not the least difficulty in procuring
								their subsistence, as the sea and the fruits of various trees,
								sufficiently afforded them the necessary food: but in proportion as
								their numbers increased, their subsistence of course must become
								more precarious in an isle, which only yields, spontaneously, the
								necessaries for a certain determined number of inhabitants; they
								therefore soon found themselves under the necessity of devising some
								method of supplying the necessary food, principally by cultivating
								those plants, upon the wild produce of which they formerly lived.
								They began regularly to plant coco-nut-palms, bananas, South-Sea
								apples, yamboes, and bread-fruit trees, together with the yam, the
								sweet potatoe, the two kinds of eddoes, the tacca and the
								sugar-cane. These plantations being the work of the industry and
								foresight of some individuals, gave them a right to reap their
								productions; and as their example was soon followed by people
								equally solicitous for their preservation, this method of raising a
								sufficiency of food by industry and labour, became more universal;
								and when they found that the right of reaping the fruit of their own
								industry, was sometimes invaded by the indolent, the powerful, and
								the desperate, they began to form associations for the defence of
								their plantations, on which their very existence depended; they
								consequently stipulated, first among themselves, not to destroy one
								anothers plantations, to defend them jointly against the violence of
								others, and to give one another mutual assistance; in this manner
								the plantations were increased, extended, and in a manner surrounded
								by those of others; then every one began to look upon the land
								occupied by his trees or roots, as having a more immediate connexion
								with his person, or with the family or society to which he belonged;
								and hence arose the first ideas of property. Thus were gradually
								introduced certain regulations, agreed upon by mutual consent, and
								thus were soon formed those customary laws, which more or less take
								place among the nations that have property. The experience of
								several years soon taught them to distinguish the soil and season,
								most proper for each of the plants and roots; the most easy and
								useful method of preparing the soil for the reception and
								propagation of them, together with the means of averting danger from
								those vegetables, which are of so great consequence to them: the
								preservation of these eatables, by way of store, again required new
								efforts of genius and several experiments; and lastly, the
								preparation of them into various dishes, in order to avoid sameness
								and uniformity, still enriched their knowledge, and increased the
								stock of their useful ideas, and practical operations. Isles are, on
								account of their circumscribed size, more apt to promote and to
								accelerate civilization, than large continents; for in these, the
								inhabitants having too much room to roam over the country, and to
								disperse, in case of a disgust, or offence, they are prevented from
								entering into associations, and from making useful regulations
								relative to mutual assistance and mutual defence; and as they meet
								either with a sufficiency of spontaneous fruits, on a large tract of
								unoccupied land, or have opportunities to live by the chace, or by
								fishing, they constantly refuse to provide for their subsistence by
								a laborious, toilsome cultivation. However, in small islands, where
								the numbers of people are too inconsiderable for affording mutual
								security and assistance, or for forming a powerful society, and
								where there is no chance either for cultivation varied according to
								the difference of soil and exposures, or for extensive plantations,
								there likewise, it is in vain to expect so well regulated societies,
								as in isles of a tolerable size, and of various exposures and soils.
								It is therefore in my opinion evident, that the largest of the
								tropical isles, when all the other circumstances concur, must be the
								happiest and most civilized, as none of them is of too great
								extent.</p><p n="411">Otaheitee and the neighbouring Society isles, are in this point
								nearer to happiness than any other nations we met with. They have a
								greater variety of food and in greater abundance, than any of the
								other nations. Their dress is likewise more varied, a kind of
								refinement this, which most of the other nations either entirely
								want, or at least in a very imperfect manner possess. Their
								habitations are clean and roomy, and those of the better sort of
								people are even neat and elegant, as far as these advantages may be
								carried in its first rude beginning.</p><p n="412">They have ideas of many things, which never occurred to other nations
								of the South Sea, their intellectual faculties, enlarged by
								instruction and exercise, are capable of comprehending, retaining,
								reproducing, and combining ideas, and though extremely quick of
								perception, and lively in their tempers, they are however, equally
								jealous of their liberty and free agency; and what is still more
								happy, the simple but rational education, the happiest organization
								and the mildness of their climate concur in forming their minds for
								benevolence, and in filling their hearts with soft and tender
								feelings, and a charitable disposition. Any foreigner endeavouring
								to ingratiate himself with these generous friendly people, will soon
								succeed, though they can reap no benefit or advantage from a
								connection with him; and if he should happen to be sick, indisposed,
								distressed, or only tired, or wanting some refreshment; they will
								all vie one with another to assist, to nurse and to refresh him.
								Their hearts are capable of the warmest attachment, of the most
								generous friendship, and of the most tender connexions, of which, in
								our mixed and degenerating societies, we have very few instances;
								perhaps none at all, where such a disinterested, generous love, or
								such an enthusiasm of passion forms the basis of the tender
								connexion. Having myself felt all the tender emotions of a parent,
								during the soft moments of filial endearment, I flatter myself that
								I was in this case no incompetent judge; however I must confess that
								several of their children, and even of their more grown youths, had
								such winning and captivating means of ingratiating themselves with
								me; they shewed such confidence, openness, and grateful returns to
								the little trifling presents I used to make them; they became so
								attached to me, and were so studious of rendering me some small
								services, and of warning me against the thievish practices of some
								of their countrymen, that my heart could not resist their
								insinuating and innocently kind behaviour. I felt for many of them
								emotions, which were not so far distant from paternal affection and
								complacency, as might be expected, when we recollect the great
								difference of our manners and our way of thinking. But I found
								likewise on this occasion, what a great and venerable blessing
								benevolence is; when it is no longer the fashionable cant, borrowed
								from a favourite poet, or a moral romance, and dwelling only on mens
								lips; but when this best gift of heaven fits enthroned in the heart,
								fills the soul with gracious sensations, and prompts all our
								faculties to expressions of good-nature and kindness: then only does
								it connect all mankind as it were into one family; youths of distant
								nations become brethren, and the older people of one nation, find
								children in the offspring of the other. All those distinctions which
								ambition, wealth, and luxury, have introduced, are levelled, and the
								inhabitant of the polar region, finds a warm and generous friend in
								the torrid zone or in the opposite hemisphere. Still my heart was
								filled with tender affliction, and my eyes overflowed with tears of
								genuine sorrow, when I perceived that our own civilized countries,
								notwithstanding the numberless improvements they had received from
								the establishment of excellent laws, and the cultivation of arts and
								sciences; notwithstanding the frequent occasions of still greater
								improvement, and the glorious encouragement to virtue and morality,
								were far outdone in real goodness and benevolence by a set of
								innocent people, so much our inferiors in many other respects; and I
								could not help repeatedly wishing, that our civilized Europeans
								might add to their many advantages, that innocence of heart and
								genuine simplicity of manners, that spirit of benevolence, and real
								goodness, which these my new acquired friends so eminently
								possessed.</p><p n="413">The Taheiteans as individuals, not only have the several good
								qualities above mentioned, of a domestic kind, but they are likewise
								sensible of the great advantages of a social or civil union: and as
								far as our imperfect knowledge of their language; our short stay
								amongst them, and the desultory instruction of Maheine and O-Mai
								would permit, I have reasons to think, that the beginning of their
								civil society is founded on paternal authority, and is of the
								patriarchal kind. The husband and the wife of his bosom, whom love
								unites by the silken ties of matrimony, form the first society. This
								union is, in these happy regions, first founded on the call of
								nature, in mutual assistance, and the sweet hopes of seeing
								themselves reproduced in a numerous offspring. In more degenerated
								nations, matrimonial union takes place from brutal appetite, is
								grounded upon the satisfaction of sensuality, the expectation of
								assistance from persons, whom oppression and custom has condemned to
								become drudges, and lastly the idea of gaining more strength and
								power from a numerous family of children. On the contrary, the
								mildness of the climate, the happiness of organization, and the kind
								and benevolent temper of this people, together with their more
								enlightened intellects, contribute very much to refine and to
								ennoble that soft passion which is the first beginning of this
								congenial harmony; and hence the brutish instincts, which were wants
								of the same low rank with hunger and thirst, are raised to a
								lasting, virtuous passion. This refinement of mutual love and
								matrimonial complacency, produces those tender regards with which
								this happy passion inspires its votaries for the beloved object; and
								it creates that mutual happiness, which is the result of all the
								more refined manners, and of their more polished behaviour towards
								one another. The offspring of such a happy couple early imbibe by
								the example of their parents, that kindness and benevolence, and
								those refined sentiments of love and happiness, which contribute so
								much to confirm the felicity of their parents, and wish to reduce
								them to practice, as soon as they feel the call of nature and find a
								partner whose sentiments are in unison with their own; so that these
								simple, but more exalted ideas of matrimonial union, and thus
								propagated and perpetuated in the progeny of a virtuous and tender
								couple. But before they attain that age of discretion and maturity,
								the fond parents take peculiar care of their education; they
								frequently check the wild flights of their unruly passions, and
								instill order, moderate industry, and the principles of benevolence
								and gratitude into their tender minds. I have seen mothers punishing
								obstinacy and disobedience, and though extremely fond of their
								children, they nevertheless are sensible enough thus far to do
								violence to their own feelings, that their children may not acquire
								a habit of ingratitude, obstinacy, and immorality; I have likewise
								heard them expostulating with their unruly little ones, and
								expressing their displeasure at their conduct; all which proves that
								they have ideas of moral rectitude, of order and filial
								subordination, and of the necessity of instilling these principles
								early into the minds of their children. Nor is this careful
								education without the good effects, which ought to be the
								consequence of it: for we saw many a family, where every individual
								belonging to it, gave strong marks of an attachment to the rest of
								the family, and evident proofs of those ties of benevolence which
								united them all. The younger part of them shewed reverence and
								respect to the older individuals, and at the least and most distant
								danger were alarmed and anxious for the welfare and safety of their
								parents. The injunctions of the parents were executed, with a
								readiness and truly exemplary affection. The father seemed to be the
								soul which animated the whole body of the family by his superior
								wisdom, benevolence and experience; in a word, they all assist one
								another and contribute their share of offices and labour towards the
								support, security and happiness of the whole family.</p><p n="414">If several families find the wisdom, experience, valour, and
								benevolence of one head of a family to be superior to those of the
								rest, they all look upon him as their common father, they submit to
								his advice as to injunctions, and his councils become as sacred and
								inviolable as laws. This voluntary union into one great family,
								diffuses through them all that attachment, and benevolence, that
								spirit of order and regularity, which are the true promoters of
								morality, and universal happiness. If the son of this chief has
								skill, address and benevolence enough to tread in his fathers
								footsteps, he succeeds his father in authority, and thus a society
								gradually accustom themselves to look upon their chiefs with
								reverence, and accept the posterity of an equitable, benevolent
								leader, for their hereditary chief. As all the regulations for the
								weal of the society are chiefly issued by this ruler, as he is
								foremost in defending their liberty and property against any daring
								invader of their common right, as he decides between man and man in
								private disagreements, and punished the wanton disturbers of public
								peace, all the authority of the whole community, centers in him; and
								as many advantages accrue to him on different occasions and
								opportunities offer of making acquisitions of property, either by
								the voluntary, general contributions, of all the inferior members of
								the community, or by the administration and distribution of the
								public property and wealth, it may be expected that he will become
								possessed of a greater share of wealth than any of the rest, which
								must gradually give him more influence and greater power: his family
								no doubt participate of this power, influence and wealth, and
								consequently form a class of people distinct from the commons.</p><p n="415">If the society is attacked or injured by another society, and all
								unite to avert the injuries, to repel violence, and to retaliate
								upon the invaders and disturbers of the peace, the same wrongs which
								they intended to inflict; it is natural to suppose, that upon a very
								great provocation, and a consequently greater exertion of power,
								they may become victorious, which must, of course, make the
								condition of the vanquished tribe, inferior to that of the lowest of
								the victorious community, and create a new rank of people in their
								society. These seem to be the consequences of matrimonial union, of
								paternal authority, and the more general authority of a chief of a
								society, and the origin of ranks in O-Taheitee, the Society, and
								Friendly Isles.</p><p n="416">The great chief is called Aree-rahai: the rest of his family are all
								Arees, and have some landed property, and among them we observed men
								of still greater rank and authority, who were chiefs of the
								differents districts, or Whennuas in the isle, and were called after
								the district, which was entrusted to their care and government; thus
								Hapai O-Tu's father was Aree n'O-parre, chief of Oparre; O-Retti was
								chief of O-Hiddea; O-Amo was chief of Papara; T-Owha and Potatou
								were joint-chiefs of Atahooroo; Toppere had the direction of Matavai
								and Toomataroa that of Tittahaw. Besides these, is a class of people
								called Manahounes, who have landed property; and lastly, those
								belonging to the lowest rank of people are called Toutous.</p><p n="417">As several words of the Malay language, are found in the O-Taheitee
								tongue, and its various dialects, they may be considered as proofs
								of the origin of these islanders. I am not willing to affirm that
								they are absolutely the immediate offspring of the Malays; but it
								appeared to me very obvious from many concurring circumstances, that
								they were descended from some tribes, that are related to the
								Malays. The Tagalas and Pampangas are no doubt the offspring of the
								Malays; for Dr. Gemelli Carreri affirms, that they came from the
								continent of Malacca, and they themselves allow, that they came from
								Borneo.*<ref target="#jf126"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf126">* Voyage autour du monde par Gemelli Carreri, tom. v. p. 64.</note></ref> The inhabitants of the Ladrones speak a language related to

								islands, and the similarity of their customs and manners, make it
								highly probable, that the same nation is spread all over that great
								cluster of islands, extending for more than 30 degrees of longitude;
								and from thence to Byrons Island, and some of those islands where
								the Taheitean dialect is spoken, is not so great a distance. By this
								line I presume to trace the first migration of the tribes, who first
								peopled the Eastern South-Sea isles. If we add to this the great
								similarity between the manners and customs of the inhabitants of the
								Caroline islands, and those of the Friendly isles, this line of
								migration must appear to be something more than mere conjecture.</p><p n="418">The most authentic accounts of a modern philosophic traveller=<ref target="#jf128"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf128">= Mr. le Poivre.</note></ref> inform
								us, that a kind of feudal system is received by the Malays, which,
								as far as we know, admits of several ranks of men, very much in the
								same manner as we observed in the Society isles; and they possess
								likewise their lands by a kind of feudal tenure. The great chief or
								king, grants to the inferior chiefs, a district or province: under
								them, the rest of the Arees or chiefs have portions of land allotted
								to them; and the Manahounes, though not of the royal family, have
								likewise grants of land. The chiefs of the provinces, as well as the
								inferior Arees, have their demesnes cultivated by Toutous, who are
								obliged to raise fruits and roots, for the necessary food of their
								Aree; to fish, to build houses and canoes, to make cloth, to work
								their boats in war and peace, and to do every thing they bid them:
								and for this service they have the overplus of fruit and fish; which
								latter, the chief commonly distributes among all his vassals, very
								impartially, if they catch a considerable quantity at once. The
								Manahoune, his brethren, and offspring, cultivate the ground, which
								is granted to them; and I cannot say, that I ever observed Toutous
								attached to them. In war time, the great chief, with the advice of
								his relations, and of the chiefs of the provinces, who seem to have
								great influence in public affairs, orders an armament to be
								prepared; and as the shores only are inhabited, the attack commonly
								is made by sea: for that reason they have numbers of war-canoes,
								built and laid up under large sheds, which are immediately fitted
								out upon any such requisition, from the Lord Paramount; each
								inferior chief and Manahoune is again either master of such a
								war-canoe, or he does service on board of one of them, as a warrior,
								and the Toutous are employed in paddling and working them. The
								chiefs of provinces regulate every thing in their districts, and
								administer justice, their authority being as great as that of the
								king. On extraordinary occasions, however, the king interposes his
								authority: thus I heard Oree, king of Huaheine, order his Hoa*<ref target="#jf129"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf129">= Mr. le Poivre.</note></ref> to go
								into a district of another chief, and bid him tell such were the
								words of the Aree-rahei; to apprehend the thieves, and seize the
								stolen goods, which he enumerated; the goods were in part restored
								the same day, and the next day he was ready to punish the thieves in
								our presence, had we not already been too far out at sea, and had we
								at first well understood his meaning. At O-Taheitee we saw the
								review of the naval armaments of two districts, which were destined
								to subdue a great revolted vassal, or feudal lord, on the isle of
								Imeo, in the district of Morea; and we were told, that every chief
								of a district must send his quota towards this expedition: and even
								the great chief of O-Taheitee-eetee, or Tiarraboo, would join in it
								as his duty required. O-Too, perhaps, not being well enough skilled
								in the noble art of war, was not intended to command the fleet, and
								therefore gave the dignity of high-admiral to T-Owha, chief of
								Atahooroo; though he told us at the same time, that he would
								likewise be in the fleet, in the quality of a warrior, or as we
								might call it; of a knight. These circumstances sufficiently prove,
								that their government is a kind of feudal system; but it has much of
								that original patriarchal form, blended with it, which rectifies the
								many defects of the feudal government, and for that very reason is
								infinitely superior to it, being founded on principles of kindness
								and benevolence, and on that primitive simplicity, which bears
								always the stamp of perfect undegenerated nature.</p><p n="419">However, upon comparing every circumstance more minutely, as the
								Taheiteans allow themselves to have formerly been cannibals, and
								likewise as their chiefs, Manahounes and warriors, are all of a
								fairer colour than the Toutous; it might not perhaps be inconsistent
								to suppose, that the first and aboriginal inhabitants of the
								South-Sea isles, were of the tribe of the Papuas and people from
								New-Guinea, and its neighbourhood, and such as we found at
								Mallicollo, Tanna, and the New-Hebrides, and therefore were like
								them men-eaters.4 It is probable, that either by accident, or on
								purpose, the ancient Malays of the Peninsula, of Malacca, gradually
								spread among the isles of the Indian seas; first over Borneo, then
								to the Philippines; from whence they extended over the Ladrone
								islands, the New-Carolines, and Pesoadores; and lastly, they removed
								to the Friendly-islands, the Society-islands, the Marquesas and
								Easter-island, to the Eastward; and to New-Zeeland to the Southward.
								This migration seems to have been successive, and perhaps several
								centuries elapsed, from the first removal of the Malays to Borneo,
								to the arrival of these tribes at New-Zeeland, and Easter-island. In
								each station they acquired a new tincture of manners and customs
								varied by climate, and the particular situation of each land which
								they gradually occupied; and being no doubt, opposed by the first
								aboriginal inhabitants, it cost a great deal of bloodshed, labour,
								and time, before they could entirely subdue them. In the larger
								islands, Borneo, Lu‡on, Maghindanao,5 and some of the Moluccas, they
								were not conquered, but retired into the interior mountainous parts;
								and are still existing and known under the names of Byajos,
								Negrillos, Zambales, Allfoories, &amp;c. &amp;c. In the Friendly and
								Society-islands, the aboriginal inhabitants were subdued, and became
								Toutous. Their more polished and more civilized conquerors,
								established a mild and humane kind of government, wherein they
								introduced the oriental or Malay-feudal system, and endeavoured to
								wean their new subjects from that cruel cannibalism, which generally
								prevailed among all the aboriginal black tribes of the South-Sea. In
								this benevolent and humane undertaking they at last so far
								succeeded, that the name only, and a faint tradition of the
								existence of such a custom in O-Taheitee, are preserved. This
								hypothesis likewise accounts for the various traditions of the
								Taheiteans, who know, for instance, in their neighbourhood, an isle
								called Mannua, occupied by men-eaters, which, according to this
								conjecture, is a proof of its being inhabited by the aboriginal
								black race of people, who are, as far as we know, all cannibals. In
								New-Zeeland, I am of opinion, that the more civilized Malay tribes,
								mixed with the aboriginals, and the harshness of the climate, the
								roughness of the wild woody country, together with its great extent,
								contributed to preserve cannibalism, and to form a coalition of
								customs, wherein many points of civilization were totally lost,
								though the language was taken from the new-comers, and preserved
								blended with some words of the aboriginal tribe. Savage-island,
								whose inhabitants we found very tawny and ferocious, might perhaps
								be another island, which the Malay tribes have not hitherto been
								able to subdue; nay, as the inhabitants of Tanna, were likewise
								acquainted with a language totally different from theirs, called the
								Footoona language, or that of Irronan, which we found to correspond
								with the dialect spoken at the Friendly-islands, it seems from
								thence to follow, that the Malay tribes still endeavour to spread,
								and to subdue the aboriginal tribes in the various South-Sea isles.
								These hints, it is to be hoped, may induce some future navigators
								more carefully to examine the languages, manners, customs, temper,
								habit and colour of body of the inhabitants of the various South-Sea
								isles, in order still better to trace the origin and migrations of
								these nations; and to throw a still greater light on this
								interesting part of the History of Man.</p><p n="420">It is however remarkable, that the nearer we approach to the Western
								or Friendly-islands, the greater is the respect, and the more
								numerous are external marks of subjection shewn by the common people
								to their chiefs and kings. In Easter-island, and the Marquesas, we
								observed hardly any difference between the subject and chief, if we
								except a more conspicuous dress, some attendants and the name of
								Areckee or A-ka-hai. In O-Taheitee, and the Society-isles, the lower
								ranks of people, by way of respect, strip off their upper garment,
								in the presence of their Aree-rahai. But at Tonga Tabu and
								Horn-Island,*<ref target="#jf130"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf130">* See Mr. Dalrymples Collection of Voyages to the South-Sea, vol. ii. p. 41, 55.</note></ref> the common people shew their great chief or Latoo the
								greatest respect imaginable, by prostrating themselves before him,
								and by putting his foot on their necks. In the Ladrone islands, the
								Tamolas or nobles are likewise highly revered, and none of the
								common people dare come near them, for fear of defiling them.=<ref target="#jf131"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf131">= Des Brosses Historie des Navigations aux Terres australes, tom. ii. p. 484, 499.</note></ref> These
								circumstances in my opinion, prove, that the natives of the
								South-Sea isles changed some of their manners, and laid aside part
								of that stiffness, formality and humiliating respect paid to their
								chiefs in proportion, as they removed from the country, which gave
								birth to their first ancestors; and it is by this mixture of manners
								that the inhabitants of Taheitee have arrived at that happy mean
								which assigns the just bounds of prerogative to each rank of people,
								and thus places the true principles of happiness on a firm and solid
								basis. The king has a certain respect shewn him, which is decent and
								necessary, and he is invested with a degree of authority and power,
								sufficient to enable him to become beneficial to his subjects,
								without permitting him to oppress them; and he can acquire the title
								of father of his people, without ever becoming their tyrant. The
								chiefs of districts are both a support and check to the royal
								dignity: they form the great council of the nation, assembled on
								important affairs, especially war and peace: without their consent,
								the king cannot undertake any thing which might influence the public
								peace or safety, or punish any great Lord: without them the king is
								unable to execute great achievements, for if they should find him
								disposed to abuse his power, they would either refuse to assist him
								with the force of their district, or they would, perhaps, associate
								with those whom the king might be willing to oppress, and therefore
								prevent his progress towards despotism, by balancing his power, or
								by opposing his increase of prerogative. The war against the chief
								of Morea, on the island of Imeo, which the Taheiteans proposed to
								carry on, after our departure, and for which we saw such great
								preparations confirms the truth of this assertion. The chiefs of
								each district being subject to the king, dare not oppress their own
								subjects, who, in that case would either bring their complaints
								before his paramount, or they might form associations, in order to
								defend themselves against his rapines, oppression and despotism. The
								facility of procuring the necessaries of life, and even those
								articles which are here reckoned to be luxuries; together with the
								humane and benevolent temper of these nations have hitherto happily
								prevented the oppression of the Toutous; and if the morals of these
								people are not influenced and corrupted by the commerce and
								intercourse with European profligates, and by the introduction of
								new luxuries, which can be procured only by hard labour and
								drudgery, the happiness of the lowest class of people, will,
								probably be of long continuance; and forbid it humanity and
								benevolence, that any one of us should be wicked enough to form a
								wish or a plan to entail misery and wretchedness, on a happy and
								harmless race of men!</p><p n="421">They have undoubtedly customary laws and regulations relative to the
								good order of their societies, for the security both of their
								property and of the lives of individuals, and punishments which are
								inflicted on those who transgress these laws, and disturb the public
								peace. At the time when one of the natives had stolen a musket from
								a centry at the tents on Point Venus in O-Taheitee, the centry was
								carried on board under confinement, and previous to the punishment
								inflicted on him for the neglect of his duty, the articles of war
								were read before the whole ship's company assembled on deck; during
								this ceremony, it is customary for every body to be uncovered. The
								natives, among whom were some of the king's relations, observing
								that something extraordinary was going forward, were particularly
								curious to know what the long para-parou, or speech signified; I
								told them it was the word of the great king of our nation; upon
								which they all agreed among themselves that it was Meera; which I
								suppose from the above circumstances to signify law, or regulation.
								They frequently told us that they killed thieves, by hanging a large
								stone to their necks and drowning them in the sea: however, in a
								nation which has so much innocence and benevolence, and so few
								wants, the greater part of which, may very easily be satisfied, this
								crime must be rare. Murder seems to be a crime unknown among them;
								though we frequently saw some of them disagree, and fight, yet the
								bystanders were always ready to part them, in order to prevent
								further mischief, and their hearts are not yet degraded to that
								degree of degeneracy and baseness, as to permit them to postpone
								vengeance to another time, and to lay a plan in cool blood, and in a
								deliberate manner, to execute it with more certainty and security to
								themselves. Like true children of nature, their passions, the great
								principles of self-preservation and defence, prompt them to punish
								and repel their real or imaginary wrongs, and as soon as they have
								shewed that they are not destitute of a noble resentment, they yield
								to the endeavours of their brethren to establish peace and harmony,
								and are as easily reconciled to their antagonists.</p><p n="422">Among the chiefs, instances of matrimonial infidelity are to be met
								with, which seem therefore, as in Europe, to be the vicious
								prerogative attached to rank and dignity. The natives told us, that
								adultery is punished with death among them, but we saw no instances
								of it, and those on the part of the husband which came to my
								knowledge, were no further punished, than that the justly
								exasperated wife, Juno like, treated her husband, with all the flow
								of bad language she was mistress of, and that she in great haste and
								wrath imparted some boxes on the ear to the fair one, whom she found
								desirous of encroaching upon her prerogative rights.</p><p n="423">These happy isles have almost every article necessary for the supply
								of their wants; nevertheless their manners are already so far
								polished, that they like to be possessed of some articles chiefly of
								ornaments and luxury, which they cannot meet with in their own isle,
								or at least, not in such plenty as in others situated in the
								neighbourhood. Bora-bora, and O-Tahaw, are both well provided with
								coco-nut-palms, from which they manufacture an oil, well known in
								the East Indies; the inhabitants of Taheitee and its neighbourhood,
								use this oil perfumed, by means of various odoriferous plants, and
								aromatic woods, as an article of luxury to stain and to perfume
								their cloth, and even their hair, and sometimes their bodies. As the
								coco-nut-trees are not so plentiful in O-Taheitee as to enable the
								inhabitants to prepare a quantity of oil, to satisfy the great
								demand for it, and as on the contrary, the natives of Bora-bora, and
								O-Tahaw, cannot manufacture such a profusion and variety of cloth as
								they do at O-Taheitee, where the paper-mulberry-tree is much
								cultivated; there are persons who every year undertake a voyage from
								Taheitee to Tahaw and Bora-bora, in order to barter great quantities
								of cloth, for joints of thick bamboo-reeds filled with coco-nut oil.
								The Low-Islands have a race of dogs with long white hair, which the
								natives employ in fringing their breast-plates or war gorgets; and
								these low islanders cannot cultivate the mulberry-tree on their
								sandy, barren ledges of lands, which includes their salt lagoons;
								therefore these reciprocal wants, form a kind of commerce between
								the inhabitants of the high and low islands, and a mutual exchange
								of superfluities. The red feathers of parrots are employed in
								ornaments for their warriors, being fixed at the end of the tassels,
								which they wear like queues, and likewise in small bundles tied
								together with coco-nut-core, which they make use of in order to fix
								their attention during their prayers. The O-Taheitee parrot has but
								few and very dirty red feathers, but more to the West are islands,
								which have fine parroquets remarkable for beautiful red feathers.
								One of these isles is low, and destitute of inhabitants, at about
								ten days sail from O-Taheitee and is called Whennua-oora the Land of
								red feathers, to which the people from the Society Isles sometimes
								resort, in order to procure some of these red feathers, for they are
								the most valuable article of commerce, and there is nothing which a
								Taheitean would not give or grant in order to acquire some of these
								precious feathers. We brought some bright red feathers from England,
								but they soon found out they were only cocks feathers, and died red,
								and for that reason did not esteem them; they took them indeed, but
								refused to give any thing in return. Whereas, when we came the
								second time, in 1774, to O-Taheitee after we had been to Tonga Tabu,
								where the natives make various ornaments of red feathers, we
								procured for them not only numbers of hogs, the most valuable
								article of trade, but likewise mourning dresses, which the natives
								refused to part with before, when Mr. Banks was there, and during
								our first stay in their happy isle.6 The rage after these trifling
								ornaments was so great, that Potatou a chief, whose magnanimity and
								noble way of thinking, we never questioned before, wanted even to
								prostitute his own wife, for a parcel of these baubles. All kinds of
								iron tools are likewise become great articles of commerce, since
								their connexions with Europeans. The Spaniards first made the
								inhabitants of all these islands acquainted with iron; and I am of
								opinion that even its O-Taheitean name is of Spanish origin; for
								when Oliver van Noort came in the year 1600 to Guaham one of the
								Ladrone Islands, he saw more than 200 canoes full of natives coming
								off with coco-nuts, bananas, sugar-canes, fish, &amp;c. and all
								wanted to exchange these refreshments for iron, crying aloud hierro!
								hierro! which is the Spanish name for iron, and in its pronunciation
								not very different from yuree, the Taheitean word for the same; and
								as the Ladrones as well as Taheitee, or at least some neighbouring
								isles, were first seen by Spaniards, there is very little doubt but
								the name of yuree is originally meant for hierro.7 The loss of one
								of Roggewyn's ships in 1772, on the low island of O-Anna, gave these
								islanders again a fresh supply of iron.8 The anchors lost by Mr. de
								Bougainville at O-Hidea were afterwards taken up by the natives, and
								the king of Taheitee sent one as a rare present to Opunee king of
								Bora-bora. Lastly the English imported such quantities of
								iron-tools, especially hatchets, chissels, plains, saws, gimlets,
								and spikes and nails of all dimensions, that this commodity will not
								easily come into disuse among them, and is still less likely to be
								entirely forgotten. Especially as all these nations are very
								remarkable for preserving the smallest pieces of iron for many
								years: thus for instance, when we landed at Tonga-tabu one of the
								natives sold a very small nail carefully fastened in a handle of
								hard wood, and tied to it by strings of coco-nut-core. This nail was
								undoubtedly left by Taesman, who was there in 1643, and consequently
								had been preserved 130 years, and is now lodged amongst other
								curiosities in the British Museum. Beads of glass, since our several
								expeditions to the South Sea, are very common; as incredible
								quantities have been exchanged in these Seas for coco-nuts, yams,
								and bread-fruit. It is however, remarkable, that in O-Taheitee,
								those which were white and transparent were preferred in the
								Friendly Islands, the black beads were in high esteem; and green
								ear-rings, and green or red glass buttons were most eagerly sought
								after in New-Zeeland. Each of these nations therefore had a peculiar
								taste. At Tanna the casuarina-wood for clubs was brought from
								Irromanga, hatchets made of black solid lava came from Anattom, and
								those of white shell from Immer. So that each country gives up its
								superfluities in exchange for other articles, which are less common,
								and deemed either really necessary, or an improvement, or an article
								of luxury.</p><p n="424">The acquisition of the various articles of commerce form the wealth
								and the opulence of individuals in these islands. Our stay at
								O-Taheitee has raised many persons from a low rank, and from poverty
								to affluence and a higher class; for when a man at Taheitee had
								acquired some wealth, he could keep it for his own use, or was
								permitted to dispose of it in such a manner as he pleased. This
								likewise was observed at Easter-island, the Marquesas, New-Zeeland,
								the New-Hebrides and New-Caledonia: but at the Friendly-islands the
								case was otherwise; Attaha, one of the inferior chiefs, was obliged
								to deliver all the presents he had received to their Latoo-Nipooroo;
								this was likewise practised by all the other chiefs; the priest was
								not obliged to pay this kind of homage or acknowledgment of his
								subjection to the great chief. Whenever the lower ranks of people at
								Taheitee stole any valuable articles, the chiefs either seized the
								whole booty, or at least shared the spoils with their Toutous,
								though they never deprived them by force of the effects, which they
								received in exchange for their eatables, cloth, furniture, and
								implements of war. However we found, that after some time, all this
								acquired wealth flowed as presents, or voluntary acknowledgments
								into the treasure of the various chiefs; who it seems were the only
								possessors of all the hatchets and broad axes; the use of which,
								they granted to their subjects, on certain occasions, probably for
								some acknowledgment. What makes me more inclined to believe this
								circumstance, is the account of the very same custom observed at the
								Caroline Islands, where the inhabitants appropriate all the iron
								which they find on wrecked ships, to their Tamoles or chiefs, who
								have such tools made from them, as the size of the iron will admit,
								which they let for a high price to their subjects.*<ref target="#jf132"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf132">* Des Brosses Historie des Navigations aux Terres australes, vol. ii. p. 485.</note></ref>
								But the real
								wealth of the natives at Taheitee, the Society-islands, the
								Marquesas, the Friendly-islands, and even Easter-island, consists in
								the possession of their lands, which the manahounes cultivate with
								the assistance of their families; whereas, the possessions of their
								chiefs, as well as the royal demesnes, are under the inspection and
								cultivation of their own toutous: they feed the hogs and dogs of
								their masters, which constitute their greatest riches; they
								cultivate the banana-trees, take care of the bread-fruit and
								apple-trees, sugar-canes, yams, eddoes, taccas, potatoes, and other
								useful vegetables; they plant the mulberry-trees, and manufacture
								their bark; lay up stores of mahei or sower-paste, and provide the
								indolent chiefs with food and raiment. It appears from hence, that
								the real wealth and opulence of their chiefs depends upon the number
								of toutous, as well as upon the extent of demesne they are possessed
								of. And that the toutou seems to be a kind of property of the tribe
								of chiefs, alienable according to the pleasure of the master, I
								collected from the following circumstance; as soon as our friend
								Maheine had found his relations on O-Taheitee, he was presented by
								them with a boy about 13 or 14 years old, called Po‰-tea-tea, who
								became to all intents and purposes his toutou, and was immediately
								remarkably attached to his new master and his friends on board the
								ship.</p><p n="425">We have already enumerated hogs and dogs among the riches of the
								natives of Taheitee, to which we added goats in 1773, that had
								already produced a couple of kids, at our return to Taheitee in the
								following year; but it is remarkable, that these few domestic
								animals, were not even common over all the South Sea isles. In all
								the low islands they have dogs, but no hogs; at the Friendly Islands
								and Tanna, they had hogs, but no dogs, at New-Zeeland they had no
								hogs, and at New-Caledonia they had neither hogs nor dogs. We gave
								at Amsterdam and Tanna the first dogs; at New-Zeeland the first hogs
								and fowls, and at New-Caledonia we left a couple of dogs, and
								another of pigs. They must formerly had had dogs at Amsterdam,
								because they knew the animal, and were acquainted with its name,
								ghooree, but have left the species, as it should seem, by some
								accident. Though both the sorts of quadrupeds which are found in the
								South Seas, are very prolific; thrive in the fine climate amazingly
								well, and soon come to maturity, they were however, not in such
								abundance, that every family could use them for common food; but the
								bulk of the nation was obliged to subsist chiefly on vegetables, the
								produce of their industry and moderate labour. In this circumstance
								I find a vestige of the infinite wisdom pursued in the works of
								nature, and her general constitution, and trace therein a part of
								the grand plan, which has no other aim than the greatest perfection
								of the whole.</p><p n="426">The animal creation is not so much in the power of man, that he can
								by his industry enlarge its prolific quality; for each animal is
								confined by invariable laws of nature to certain limits in the
								propagation of its species; if therefore the whole human race should
								subsist merely on animal food, and all mankind lead a pastoral life;
								man would gradually sink into a situation, which is entirely
								inconsistent with his physical, moral, and social happiness.
								Cultivation, or the art of raising by his industry, care, and
								labour, a sufficiency of roots, herbs, and fruits for the
								subsistence and other purposes of human life, is the only foundation
								of all the felicity which man ever can attain in this life. All
								vegetables, especially those which are now become in various
								countries and climates, the chief food of mankind, naturally thrive
								with great ease, and are moreover, capable of being multiplied in a
								stupendous proportion, by human industry. The nourishment which they
								afford is salubrious, and well adapted to the structure of the
								organs, and the whole system of animal functions in men. The
								infinite variety they afford, the excellent flavour and rich taste
								of some vegetable productions, would soon cause them to become the
								food of men, without ever cloying them. But there is something still
								more advantageous in the universal and improved culture of vegetable
								food; the more vegetables are cultivated, the more they become
								improved; which we may easily confirm by the infinite variety of
								well tasted apples and pears, cherries and plumbs, peaches and
								apricots, cabbages and turnips, potatoes and yams, and so many other
								fruits, herbs and roots, which are meliorated by continued
								cultivation, and have afforded us new varieties and sorts of the
								same kind of vegetable. The more and the better all vegetables are
								cultivated, the more they enable mankind to associate together, and
								to communicate to each other their assistance, their experience,
								their ideas and improvements. Invention is more and more at work,
								life acquires new ease and comfort, the ties of society become
								indissoluble, all social feelings are rendered polished and refined;
								every one shares, in a higher degree, the happiness, and is better
								enabled to alleviate the adversities of his fellow-creatures;
								universal peace and order become more and more a check upon the
								passions, and their wild flights; these regulations are gradually
								turned into laws, and cause a more general equality of temper, and
								manners; this is the next step to convince them of the great
								influence of vice and virtue, on their personal and social
								happiness; and at last conscience and moral sentiments begin to
								awake in every feeling breast, and prepare every one for that degree
								of happiness and enjoyment, which humanity can attain in this
								transitory life. This therefore shews evidently, that mankind, in a
								pastoral state, could never attain to that degree of improvement and
								happiness, to which agriculture, and the cultivation of vegetables,
								will easily and soon lead them. I do not, however, intend so far to
								extol agriculture, and vegetable food, as to insist that mankind
								should entirely neglect the culture, and domestication of animals; I
								am rather of opinion, that a moderate share of animal food, mixed
								with vegetables, is very well adapted to our organization, and that
								it is the joint care of animals and agriculture, which leads mankind
								to the highest degree of content, and paves the way to perfect
								happiness. I congratulate, therefore, the Taheiteans, who are
								possessed of such a variety and profusion of well-tasted and
								salubrious vegetable food, cultivated on their happy isle, together
								with two domestic quadrupeds; and who made in our last voyage, a new
								acquisition of the goat, a domestic animal; and to whose use Captain
								Cook, in his present voyage, carried rams and ewes, as well as bulls
								and cows; because so valuable a present will enable that brave
								people to make many improvements in their domestic life. If rice,
								especially that kind which grows on hilly grounds, without requiring
								to be watered, as the common rice does, mayz, some pine-apples,
								chesnuts, dates, oranges, and lemons, together with the sago-palm,
								were added to their vegetables; they would form the most rational
								present, which ever was offered to a nation, and the most grateful
								returns we could make, to a kind, humane and hospitable people, who
								generously gave us all the refreshments we stood in need of, and
								enabled us to finish a navigation, which will for ever, stand
								unparallelled in the annals of all nations. The man who shall carry
								these vegetable productions to Taheitee, and the South-Sea isles,
								and at the same time teach the inhabitants their cultivation and
								use, will become a benefactor to mankind; he will deserve to be
								ranked with Triptolemus, Orpheus, and other heroes, and merit the
								thanks and reverence of grateful posterity.</p><p n="427">The happiness resulting from the fertile climate, and from a
								profusion of fine vegetable productions, raised by the industry of
								the Manahounes and Toutous in Taheitee, and its neighbourhood; the
								very moderate and mild servitude of their Toutous, the order and
								regulation in their domestic societies, the benevolent and paternal
								affection of their chiefs, their association for the security of
								property and liberty, their commerce, wealth, and enjoyments, give
								us the best idea of the more refined and exalted situation of the
								inhabitants of Taheitee, and the Society-islands, above all the rest
								of the nations we visited in the course of our voyage. Convinced of
								the rectitude of order, and justice, as far as they relate to human
								societies; sensible of the pleasure arising from each common act of
								benevolence, and fired with the generous spirit of communicating
								happiness to as many as are willing to form with them the same
								society; they are likewise capable of that noble and disinterested
								desire to work for the common weal as much as lies in their power,
								which we call public spirit or true patriotism, and what is still
								better, they actually shew it on many occasions. I have seen a man
								eating a small proportion of bread-fruit, or other food, and
								nevertheless sharing this trifle out amongst several of his
								brethren, whilst it would admit of division. The solicitude of their
								chiefs, to strike a good bargain for their subjects, when they
								brought fruit, fish, or hogs to market, is likewise another proof of
								this assertion; nor can I omit the assistance they generally gave to
								one another; the detestation in which the better sort of people held
								all the thieves and robbers; the striking increase of happiness we
								observed in O-Taheitee, were, at our second arrival, after an
								absence of eight months, owing to the encouragement and minute
								inspection of the situation of every individual family under O-Tu,
								the resignation of the command of the fleet to T-Owha, made by O-Tu,
								and the readiness of T-Owha to undertake that expedition, though ill
								of the gout; the wisdom and public spirit with which they politely
								declined the assistance offered them by Capt. Cook for conquering
								the revolted island of Imeo. All these particulars give me the
								highest opinion of their true patriotism, and noble attachment to
								the weal of their country. This great maxim is the first germ of all
								noble social feelings and sentiments: it assigns to the various
								relations of man their true valour, and bids him act in consequence
								of each of them; it prescribes the simplicity and unity of
								principles, and the harmony of means for acting upon those
								principles. It teaches individuals to scorn to enjoy advantages
								which cannot become universal, or must be purchased at the expence
								of the happiness of the community, and makes of every individual a
								hero; who, if he lived in countries, where poets, orators, and
								authors, for gold lavish their incense, would have such monuments of
								eloquence raised to his memory, as are but too common in our
								adulatory age; and had he been born with those noble sentiments at
								Athens or Rome, he would have deserved to rank with Aristides,
								Agesilaus, Leonidas, Fabius, Africanus, Cato, and the sacred bands,
								who fill the temples of Grecian and Roman patriotism.9</p><p n="428">The whole that has been said of the happiness of the Taheiteans, and
								inhabitants of the Society-islands, is not applicable to the rest of
								the nations in the tropical isles. In the Friendly-islands,
								cultivation is carried to a higher degree, which is likewise evident
								from the fences and partitions, so ingeniously contrived, and
								artfully executed between the various possessions of each individual
								family: but at the same time their government has still much
								oriental despotism and slavish subjection to chiefs and their Latoo,
								derogatory to that dignity and liberty, to which nature destined all
								her sons and daughters: the first is owing to the great population
								of these isles; the latter proves them to be nearer to that country,
								from whence they came, and where abject humiliations for chiefs and
								princes are common, and originally were introduced by preposterous
								obsequiousness and abject flattery, and afterwards established and
								propagated by tyranny and oppression. We were witness to their
								prostrations before their chief, but our stay was too short to be
								able to judge of their laws, and form of government. We found Attaha
								to have great authority at the place where we landed; there were,
								however, other chiefs, who had certainly more authority than he,
								which went so far, that he was afraid of sitting at dinner with us
								in their presence. One of these superior chiefs had great influence
								and weight with all the people in the boats, to whom some of our
								friends gave the title of lord high admiral; their priest was
								likewise a man of considerable authority, even to such a degree,
								that when all the other chiefs constantly gave the presents they had
								received from us to the Latoo, and the great authority this chief
								had assumed to himself. Several other chiefs were ready enough to
								order their people to do something, and we found their orders always
								respected; but I never saw them take any goods or fruits, from the
								inferior people, in order to give to us; nor did they rob their
								people of the things they had exchanged for various articles; this
								behaviour, should perhaps, teach us to think that they have made
								regulations for securing to individuals, personal property in these
								isles. In the Marquesas and Easter-island, there was hardly a
								distinction observable between the magistrate and the subject; they
								had the name of the dignity, they had some attendance, and were, on
								the arrival of strangers, better dressed; but their authority, if we
								may judge, from the few instances, we could observe during our short
								interviews with these people, seemed to be more familiar to the
								advice of a benevolent parent, than to the imperious dictates of a
								king. In the more Western isles of Mallicollo, Tanna, and
								New-Caledonia, we observed likewise chiefs, under the denominations
								Aleeghee or Areekee, but they were, upon the whole, not
								distinguished from their subjects, by rank or authority, and seen to
								enjoy only an hereditary title; and as to the laws of these people,
								we are not presumptuous enough to talk of things, which we had
								neither opportunities, nor time, nor sufficient knowledge of the
								language to observe. They had plantations in these isles, and we saw
								that several small families cleared spots of ground for that
								purpose, and it is very natural to suppose that they likewise reap
								the fruits of their labours. In general it appeared to us, that
								O-Taheitee and the cluster of high isles in its neighbourhood, were
								the only spots where civilization had made some progress, and where
								these advantages were not again over-balanced by defects in the
								constitution or government. I cannot dismiss this subject without
								observing, that though the tropical isles of the South-Sea, never
								may, perhaps, be so unhappy, if left to themselves, as to be again
								degraded to a more debased condition; they will on the other hand,
								never be able to make, unassisted, any great or rapid progress
								towards a higher civilization, or more improved condition, because
								the small size of their isles will not admit of these improvements:
								and in case they should attempt to make conquests and unite several
								small islands into one political body; many centuries must elapse
								before the little jealousies between the vanquished people and the
								conquerors will wear off, and by a happy coalition one powerful
								nation can be established; which, however, is absolutely required,
								if they are to make large strides towards improvement in science,
								morality, arts, manufactures, or husbandry: and thus together form
								one great scene of happiness.</p></div><div type="chapter" n="26" org="uniform" sample="complete"><head><l>SECTION VII</l><l>On the Principles, Moral Ideas, Manners, Refinement,

											Lucretius.1</emph></q></l></head><p n="429">THE happy inhabitants of the tropical islands in the South-Sea,
								occupy a rank in the class of human beings, which is by no means so
								despicable, as might, at first sight, be imagined; and the
								Taheiteans and their neighbours in the Society-islands, may claim
								the highest rank among these nations. They are certainly, for many
								reasons, superior to the cannibals in New-Zeeland, and still higher
								above the rambling, poor inhabitants, of New-Holland, and the most
								unhappy wretches of Tierra del Fuego.2 In the same proportion the
								people at Tanna, and Mallicollo, exceed those at New-Caledonia;3 the
								inhabitants of the Marquesas, stand higher than the people of the
								Friendly-islands, and these must yield to the Taheiteans, as every
								circumstance concurs to confirm their high rank. The organization of
								their bodies seems to me to be the most happy and susceptible of
								enjoyment and improvement, of all the other nations
								before-mentioned; the climate they live in, the vicinity of so many
								islands, peopled by the same nation, speaking in the same language,
								enjoying the same kind of government, accustomed to the same laws
								and regulations, instructed in the same principles, having the same
								ideas in regard to morality and religion, the same food, dress,
								habitations, and general manners; in a word, every thing contributes
								to connect and to form them for a higher degree of enjoyment.</p><p n="430">Men, of different inclinations, who are endued with rational souls,
								and capable of forming various ideas, are found to make advances to
								perfection only, when they strive to acquire a competent knowledge
								of a variety of objects, and take care to admit no other ideas among
								those who may serve them in life, than such as are perfectly
								conformable to truth, and which express to the mind the real
								qualities and properties of things; and when their thoughts and
								actions are directed by the strict rule of right. In this case they
								will soon discover that though there be a strong instinct in their
								breasts, prompting them to appropriate as much good to themselves as
								possible, yet the enjoyment of it will soon become more and more
								imperfect, and unhappiness, in some measure, the consequence; but by
								transferring acts of benevolence to other men, they soon open to
								themselves an exhaustible source of enjoyment, because benefactions
								of an incredible variety may be bestowed upon an almost infinite
								number of fellow creatures, and thus we see the great principles of
								all rational human beings, ought to be candour and humanity; which
								alone are capable of giving to all their ideas, desires, and
								actions, the true direction towards real, lasting happiness, and
								raise their nature to that exalted dignity, for which they were
								originally intended.</p><p n="431">The tropical nations of the South-Seas considered in this point of
								view, seem to be deficient neither in candour, nor in humanity. For
								it is impossible to describe the inquisitive curiosity of these
								people relative to our country, government, religion, and the
								various arts by which our curious manufactures were carried on, I
								mean such as fell under their eyes, and could be understood by them.
								I was obliged to explain to them the difference between our stuffs
								made of wool, silk, cotton, and linen; by telling them the first was
								made of the hair of a hog with teeth on the forehead, (for thus they
								called our sheep when they first saw them)4 the second, I explained
								to be the thread of a caterpillar; the third, I shewed to be a
								species of their cotton called E-Vav...i or Gossypium religiosum,
								Linn. which is found in their isles, and the last I observed to be a
								kind of thread of a plant or grass; and they were all very attentive
								when I used to draw and twist some threads of their cotton in order
								the shew them the possibility of using it for that purpose. They
								were likewise very attentive while our armourer was forming hatchets
								on the anvil, or the carpenters grinding their tools; for which
								reason, Captain Cook gave them some grinding stones, and took care
								that they should be instructed in the proper use of these
								instruments. We were often obliged to explain to them our belief in
								the divinity; they used to ask how we called him in the British
								language, and endeavoured to pronounce the name of God; they were
								all attention, when according to their desire God was explained to
								be without a maker, invisible, almighty, and infinitely good; they
								required whether we addressed him in prayer, and whether we had
								priests and marais, i.e. places of worship, serving at the same time
								for burying places. All which, proves their inquisitive mind, and
								that they endeavour to acquire as many ideas as lye in their power.
								Nor were they destitute of knowledge and a system of useful ideas,
								preserved among the wise men of the nation; I include in this stock
								of ideas, their skill in cultivating certain plants for food and
								dress, and the choice of a proper soil for each of them, the various
								operations in preparing them for the various purposes required; the
								curious, and often very neat dresses, utensils, arms, and ornaments
								manufactured by them, with the simplest tools; their knowledge of
								the birds, fishes, and plants in their islands and their
								neighbourhood; their acquaintance with the winds and seasons, the
								names of the stars, and their rising and setting, and a knowledge of
								the situation of a considerable number of islands in those tropical
								seas; the art of navigating by the sun in the day time, and by the
								moon and stars in the night: the number and names of days in a
								lunation, and of lunations in a year. This exercise of their
								memories in retaining the various names expressing these ideas, and
								of other mental faculties confirming by their own experience the
								truth of the phaenomena, communicated to them by their parents and
								teachers, gives them a turn and as it were a predilection for the
								examination of truth; which, when applied to the purposes of common
								social life, gives a strong tincture of honesty and candour, which
								is most particularly necessary in all human transactions. But if we
								should require proofs of their humanity, we need only to quote the
								navigators in the Resolution, Adventure, Endeavour, Dolphin, and Mr.
								de Bougainville, at Taheitee, as so many monuments of their humanity
								and friendly disposition: they provided us with refreshments and
								vast quantities of hogs; they assisted us when we were often
								unattended a great way up in their country; they vied with each
								other in shewing us marks of their kindness and hospitality, invited
								us to sit down in the cooling shade of their houses, rubbed and
								chafed our wearied limbs, offered us a delicate dinner, prepared
								from the best of their fruits, undertook to become the bearers of
								our victuals and acquisitions of plants, shells, and fishes, in our
								excursions, carried us over all waters and rivulets on their backs,
								and fetched the ducks and other birds which we had shot; they
								entertained us with songs and dances, made us presents of cloth and
								provisions; and some of them were polite in every acceptation of the
								word, and treated us in a manner, which cannot but leave in our
								minds the most lasting impressions of their courtesy and
								benevolence.</p><p n="432">These great principles of candour and humanity, which are so well
								understood, and so generally practised by these nations, have no
								doubt, a great influence on their morals and manners. The first
								dawnings of the law of nature, taught them to be cautious, and
								abstain from doing harm to their fellow creatures; but morality
								gives the great practical lesson to make as many fellow creatures
								happy as possible. I will not however, maintain that those feelings
								of moral sense are absolutely the same at all times, in all
								climates, and among all nations: for I am well aware, that often the
								same nation approves of an action at one period of time, and at
								another condemns it. I am likewise not so ignorant as to deny that
								the same action is condemned by one people, and approved by another,
								or at least not reckoned to be criminal, because nations are in this
								respect likewise, similar to individuals: they gradually ripen to an
								age of maturity, and acquire in every age a more steady, and more
								refined moral taste; and if ever the bulk of the nation, or part of
								it, or even only individuals can dispel the prejudices surrounding
								their minds, and conquer the passions which influence their wills;
								they are sure to act according to the dictates of their conscience,
								which is in that case common sense relative to morals, and the voice
								of the divinity strongly admonishing them of their duty; they then
								become sensible, that the actions of men living in a society, are by
								no means indifferent to the community, but that every individual is
								accountable for them to his fellow creatures. Upon the whole, though
								the actions of these happy people generally have a tendency to
								humanity and benevolence, they are actuated in some measure by a
								spirit of selfishness, the great root of corruption, and are
								therefore similar in that respect to the rest of mankind, whose
								actions are a compound of selfish and humane, benevolent behaviour;
								which is made use of according as prejudices, national character,
								and other circumstances prompt them to follow either the one or the
								other impulse: and even when selfishness carried away their desires,
								to covet for instance, the iron-ware, which we had, and induced one
								or more of them to purloin a nail or knife or some such trifle, they
								were however, not so absolutely lost to all moral sense, as not to
								shew by their immediate flight, that they had wronged us: nay, often
								some of the natives, who were either attached to us from principles
								of gratitude, or had a more generous and liberal way of thinking,
								and entertained stricter notions of morality, warned us against some
								persons whom they saw in the croud pressing officiously upon us, or
								whom they had seen once frustrated in their attempts upon our
								pockets; which at least proves so much, that though some were now
								and then tempted to act contrary to the impulse of conscience on
								account of an irresistible temptation, suggesting for a moment the
								principles of selfishness, there were however others, who acted
								strictly conformable to the dictates of morality; and even the
								criminals themselves were not without remorse, or insensible that
								their action was punishable, being wrong, and that we were able to
								call them to a strict account for it, and retaliate the wrongs they
								had been committing against us. I cannot leave this subject without
								mentioning that I found immorality and selfishness, far more
								prevailing among the great and the very lowest, than among the
								middle ranks of people. King O-Too, with his sister Tourai, being
								once on a visit to Captain Cook, were introduced into his
								state-room, where constantly a quantity of iron-ware lay exposed, in
								order to have as much of it ready, as was required for the trade
								which was constantly carried on. The Captain and I were the only
								persons who were with them. Captain Cook was called out by the
								officer on deck upon some business that admitted no delay, he
								therefore desired me to stay with the royal family. The absence of
								the Captain, and the great heaps of iron, suggested to Tourai the
								idea of profiting by this opportunity, and prompted her to purloin
								some of the fine iron goods; she desired her brother to divert my
								attention; he called me to the window and wanted to shew me
								something in the canoes surrounding our ship; I suspected their
								design, and went where he called me, but kept an eye on O-Too's
								sister, who immediately seized two large ten inch spikes and
								concealed them carefully under her garment. I acquainted Captain
								Cook at his return with the transaction, but we agreed to dissemble,
								and not to alarm their fears, that the briskness of the trade might
								not be interrupted. However, I made the following observations, that
								the sight of such treasures of iron, must have been very great
								temptations; because Tourai and O-Too might have had two or more
								spikes, upon barely asking for them, and that therefore the idea of
								acquiring them by stealth, should seem to be a sudden irresistibe
								impulse, capable of overcoming the turpitude of the action, the
								danger and shame of being exposed and regarded as thieves, and the
								king becoming himself accessary to the meanest transaction; however,
								the complaisance of the king for his sister, was, equally evident,
								and in some measure makes his condescension in my opinion, less
								culpable, nor would I wish by this observation to brand Tourai or
								O-Too, as people of abandoned morals, and capable of committing any
								immoral action; for I am persuaded from other reasons, that O-Too,
								was a well meaning man, inclined to fear that we might abuse the
								superiority of our power against him and his people; but at the same
								time benevolent, good-natured, and studiously promoting the wealth,
								power, and happiness of his people: though I believe him incapable
								of acting in so noble, distinterested, and generous a manner as
								Towha, who would have shone as a great character, in whatever nation
								he might have happened to live. The character of the sister, is in
								my opinion, less amiable than that of O-Too, especially if it be
								true, what a great many used to tell us, that she was a kind of a
								Messalina, demeaning herself so low as to admit Toutous to her
								embraces.5 Besides this instance of the immorality and selfishness
								of the great, I can add another; Wainee-•u and Potatou her husband,
								were so greedy after the possession of red parrots feathers, that
								having sold all the hogs, which they possible could spare, together
								with a fine helmet, several breast-plates, and a mourning dress,
								they agreed to prostitute Wainee-•u, and she in consequence offered
								herself to Captain Cook, and appeared as a ready victim.</p><p n="433"><q><emph>- - - - - - Tunica vel...ta recincta.6</emph></q></p><p n="434">I must confess, having received a favourable and great idea of
								Potatou's character, this transaction made me ashamed of him; and
								being before elated with the thought of having found a nation, where
								one might at least find to the honour of humanity, less degeneracy
								joined to an amiable innocence and primitive simplicity, my spirits
								were damped by this unexpected scene of immorality and selfishness,
								in a family where I least expected to hear of it.</p><p n="435">The principles of chastity we found however, in many families,
								exceedingly well understood and practised, to the great satisfaction
								of all those Europeans in whose hearts lewdness had not yet effaced
								every notion of purity and morality. I have with transport seen many
								fine women, who with a modesty mixed with politeness, which would
								have graced the most exalted characters of our polite nations,
								refuse the greatest and most tempting offers made them by our
								forward youths; often they excuses themselves with a simple
								tirra-tane, "I am married," and at other times they smiled and
								declined it with eipa, "no." But it is necessary to observe that a
								nation still enjoying that just and noble simplicity of manners,
								living in large houses with several families together, in the midst
								of their children, cannot conceal certain actions, which none of our
								Europeans, who have feelings and breeding, wished to commit in so
								great companies; this naturally makes all their children acquainted
								with transactions of which some European matrons perhaps may have no
								ideas, nor has love, and all its concomitant, and most mysterious
								endearments, enjoyments, and consequences, ever been stamped in
								these happy isles with a notion of turpitude. Virtuous women hear a
								joke without emotion, which amongst us might perhaps put some men to
								the blush. Neither austerity and anger, nor joy and ecstasy is the
								consequence, but sometimes a modest, dignified, serene smile spreads
								itself over their faces, and seems gently to rebuke the uncouth
								jester, for not being better acquainted with the purer enjoyments of
								modest and virtuous love, and with the practice of that respect
								which is due to those who are its religious votaries.</p><p n="436">Thus the constant and excellent principles of candour and humanity
								teach the better individuals of this happy nation, the distinction
								between right and wrong, and spread, and confirm the notions of
								virtue and morality among them. But the actions of a people may be
								likewise considered, as far as they become expressive of a character
								peculiar to them, by which they give us an idea of their manners.
								There are nations that have such strong outlines in their
								characters, forming so essential a contrast between them and other
								nations, that it is very easy to catch them, and to describe a
								picture perfectly resembling the original; the warlike institutions
								and laws of Lycurgus gave such a strong character to the Spartans,
								that nothing was more easy than to give a picture of Spartan
								manners: but to distinguish the inhabitant of Orchomenus from that
								of Megalopolis or of Mantinea and Tegea, by these characteristics
								was a more difficult task, because the features were so small, that
								the distinction was, as it were entirely lost. The characteristics
								of the South-Sea nations, are, upon the whole, very different from
								ours, and may therefore easily be traced; however, the difference
								between them and all the nations, which are just emerging from
								barbarism, is not so very considerable, nor is it possible to point
								out such features as would at once distinguish the inhabitants of
								each particular island, from those of the others in its
								neighbourhood, especially as our stay among them was so short, and
								their language so little understood by us: we shall nevertheless
								endeavour to give some faint outlines of their manners.</p><p n="437">The general external appearance of these nations, is, no doubt, very
								strongly contrasted to ours, and we have already mentioned something
								upon that subject in the section, treating of the colour, size,
								habit of body, &amp;c. &amp;c. of these nations, which renders it
								unnecessary to repeat the same argument again.</p><p n="438">Dress characterizes people most remarkably, nor is this uniform in
								the South-Sea-Islands. The inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego, we found
								destitute of such parts of dress, which modesty would employ, and
								necessity enjoin; in the Western islands of the Pacific Ocean, where
								the climate makes dress not absolutely necessary, the nations
								covered only those parts of their body,*<ref target="#jf133"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf133">* It is therefore remarkable, that in the engraved figure of a Mallicolese, which is found in Capt. Cook's Narrative of the voyage, a drapery has been spread over the body of the figure, in direct opposition to the universal custom of that country.7</note></ref> which, by an almost general
								agreement, every nation on earth wishes to screen; but though their
								males, were, to all appearance, equally anxious in this respect with
								their females, this part of their dress served only to make that
								more conspicuous, which it intended to hide; and this device seems
								to be invented with as little delicacy and judgment as the famous
								cod-piece, which a few centuries ago made part of a man's dress in
								Europe; whether the care of preventing these parts from being
								wounded or hurt by branches of trees, briars, and insects, or real
								principles of propriety and modesty had first induced them to use so
								strange a method for covering their genitals, I cannot decide;
								however, among these same nations we observed, that only the age of
								maturity inspired them with these ideas of decency and modesty; for
								their little boys were stark naked, and little girls, below the age
								of eight years, had no other cover than a wisp of straw before, and
								another behind, fixed to a string tied round the waist. But though
								all these nations had no other parts of dress, to satisfy necessity
								in a cold climate, or modesty in a warmer; they found it
								nevertheless necessary to use various ornaments: in Tierra del
								Fuego, they painted their faces red, with a kind of ochre; in Tanna
								they somethimes laid on their faces black and white paint, in
								oblique alternating bands; the hair was sometimes divided into a
								great number of strings, not thicker than a crows-quill, and wrapt
								in strings of the bark of a bindweed, (convolvulus) which gave their
								heads a very odd appearance; the ears were generally pierced, and
								ornamented with rings of Tortoise-shell; nay, in New-Caledonia and
								Easter-Island, we found the hole enlarged to such a size, that four
								or five fingers might easily pass through, and the under part hung
								down almost to the shoulders. These preternatural apertures were
								commonly distended by scrolls of the elastic sugar-cane-leaves, or
								loaded with huge earrings, sometimes amounting to eighteen in
								number. The inhabitants of the Friendly-islands had the ear
								perforated by two holes, through which they thrust, horizontally, a
								piece of bamboo reed, or a cylinder of tortoise-shell, or other
								shell. In Mallicollo and Tanna, several men had the septum narium
								perforated, and the hole filled with a cylindrical stone; the heads
								of most of the men were bare; that of women often covered with a
								leaf of the arum esculentum, or the dracontium pertusum, or only
								surrounded by a fillet, or string. In New-Caledonia, many men had
								high cylindrical black caps, made of split bamboos, and
								coco-nut-core, which gave them a martial appearance; nor had several
								of these nations forgotten to ornament their bodies, by puncturing
								them in various figures, and filling the punctures with pounded
								coals or soot.8 But the more civilized inhabitants of Taheitee and
								the Society-isles, living in the same mild tropical climate, have
								adopted a convenient, elegant dress: the lower part of the body is
								generally wrapt in pieces of this cloth to the middle of the calf of
								their legs, and the upper part is covered with another piece, having
								a longitudinal hole cut in the middle of it, through which they
								thrust their heads, and thus they cover their shoulders, half of
								their arms, their backs and breasts: sometimes these parts hang
								loose, and at other times they are tied fast to the body by the
								lower wrapper. This lower wrapper is likewise adopted by the
								inhabitants of the Friendly-islands, with the entire omission of the
								upper-garment, which has the hole in the middle, and is called by
								the Taheiteans, tŠepoota. In the Marquesas and Easter-Island, the
								same kind of cloth is used by the natives, though the full dress
								seemed to be only a garment of ceremony, when their chiefs and women
								appeared in state; the rest of the nation being but indifferently
								covered with short wrappers about the loins. Thus may we see the
								progress in the dress which originated from a necessary shelter
								against the inclemencies of the climate, and from a sense of modesty
								was improved to a coveting equally fitted for convenience and
								elegance.</p><p n="439">The inhabitants of the Society-isles, are among all the nations of
								the South-Seas, the most cleanly; and the better sort of them carry
								cleanliness to a very great length; they bathe every morning and
								evening, in a rivulet, or the sea-water, and after they come out of
								the sea, they constantly undergo an immersion of their bodies in
								fresh water, for the ablution of the briny particles; before and
								after their meals they wash their hands; and were glad to obtain
								from us combs of all sizes and kinds, in order to adjust their hair,
								and likewise to free them from vermin, which, before the
								introduction of European combs, they frequently searched for,
								rendering this service to one another: they likewise anoint their
								hair, with perfumed coco-nut oil, both to cause a fine smell, and to
								hinder the increase of vermin, which are instantly killed, as soon
								as their spiracula are stopt up with the oil. The want of scarcity
								of fresh water, in all the Low and Friendly-Islands, makes the
								natives less careful of ablution, and causes among them, I believe,
								these cutaneous and leperous disorders, which we found so common
								among them. But the inhabitants of the New-Hebrides and
								New-Caledonia, we observed to be more cleanly, because fresh water
								is more common, and they were likewise careful in destroying the
								vermin.</p><p n="440">The inhabitants of the Friendly-Islands constantly clip the hair of
								their beards, by means of two sharp bivalve shells; and I do not
								remember to have seen, in all these isles, one single man, with a
								long beard.*<ref target="#jf134"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf134">* We are therefore sorry, that we cannot, in this instance, say of the young artist's picture, representing the landing at the Friendly-isles, which is engraved for Capt. Cook's voyage, omne tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci,9 as he made it a fine composition at the expence of truth, by giving all the men large bushy beards, contrary to the costume of the country, and by cloathing many figures from head to foot, with fine flowing draperies, in the finest Greek style, though the natives are constantly naked from the girdle upwards; the elegant form of their naked bodies would have produced as fine an effect, as the drapery: and in representations of this kind intended to accompany an history of a voyage, the chief requisite and merit is truth; which ought not to be sacrificed to whim and caprice.</note></ref> The hair of the head is commonly black, and flowing in
								beautiful natural ringlets; the natives, however, generally cut it
								short; and in a few individuals only, from Bolabola, we observed
								long hair.</p><p n="441">Besides these articles belonging to the external appearance of the
								nations in the South-Seas, there are many others, which are equally
								characteristic, and the language is none of the least striking,
								curious and interesting. We acquired only a very imperfect knowledge
								of the many languages spoken in the various isles of the South-Sea;
								we shall therefore not pretend to be very full upon this subject,
								nor can it be expected; we shall only offer on that head a few
								general remarks.</p><p n="442">The language of the Society-isles was better understood by us than
								any other, because we had made so considerable a stay among them,
								and had an opportunity of making use of the vocabularies collected
								in former voyages, and of conversing with the natives whom we had on
								board; the other dialects were only imperfectly understood. We
								found, however, that the language spoken at Easter island, the
								Marquesas, the Low, the Society, and Friendly-islands, and in
								New-Zeeland, is the same, and that the differences are hardly
								sufficient to constitute dialects. The languages spoken at the
								New-Hebrides, New-Caledonia, and New-Holland, are absolutely
								distinct from the above general language, and likewise differ among
								themselves. From a comparison of the vocabularies, in Schouten and
								le Maire's voyage, with one collected at the Friendly-islands, it
								appears, that they speak entirely the same dialect, in the
								Friendly-islands, and in those of Hope, Coco's, and Traitor's, to
								the North of the above islands. If we may be allowed to make an
								inference from one single word, I should think that at Chicayana,**<ref target="#jf135"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf135">** Dalrymple's Collection, vol. i. p. 159.</note></ref>
								a low island, four days sail from Taumaco, the same dialect is
								spoken, since ti-curi or tee-ghooree is, in both places the name for
								a dog; nay, even at the New-Caroline-Islands, they call the
								plaintive songs of their women tonguer ifaifil;=<ref target="#jf136"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf136">= Des Brosses Hist. des Navigat. aux Terres Austral. vol. ii. p. 486.</note></ref> and in New-Zeeland,
								and the Friendly-islands, the same would be expressed by tanghee
								fefeine, which is not so very different, as to discourage our
								guessing at the similarity of both languages. The language of
								Chicayana, is likewise, in my opinion, nearly related to that of the
								Tagalas, on the island of Lu‡on, because, in this tongue, great
								signifies daquila, or taquila,*<ref target="#jf137"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf137">* P. Juan de Noceda y el P. Pedro de San Lucar Vocabulario de la Lingua Tagala, Manila, 1754, fol.</note></ref> and this is the name by which the
								natives of Chicayana distinguished the great cardia, or cockles from
								those which are smaller and more common.F<ref target="#jf138"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf138">F Dalrymple's Collection of Voyages, vol. i. p. 149.</note></ref> The language of the
								Tagalas having an undoubted relation to that of the Malays, as may
								be easily collected from the comparison of the words of both
								languages; it can be no wonder that Malayan words were found in the
								Taheitean language, and its various dialects. These general
								observations on the language are so far curious and interesting, as
								they afford a farther confirmation of the origin and migration of
								these islanders.</p><p n="443">But there are other observations, occurring on a more minute
								consideration of the language itself. The first is that at Taheitee,
								and the Society-isles, the natives have no sibilant in their
								language; and therefore having no use of their organs of speech in
								forming these sounds, they become at last utterly incapable of
								pronouncing any sibilant sound whatsoever. Their words, or even
								syllables, are never terminated by a consonant, for which reason the
								natives, in imitating the names of Europeans, always added a vowel
								at the end of such names as ended in a consonant; and this likewise
								has made their language soft and agreeable on account of the number
								of vowels; and wherever they met a sibilant, or consonant, which to
								their ear was not sufficiently euphonic, they immediately
								substituted another of more easy pronunciation: Cook was changed
								into Toote, and George into Teoree. The numerous vowels require a
								variation of dipthongs and accents, to produce a multiplicity of
								sounds, and a nicety of ear to observe all these little
								distinctions, which often occasioned a material alteration of the
								sense; as ai, to eat; e...i, to copulate; eya, fish; aya, to steal
								or rob; oyo, a noddy; e-w...i, water; and ...vai, the foot; a h•w,
								a dress or cloth; ... hoo, a wind from behind; and eoo, the breasts;
								a dog is called ooree; a nail or iron yuree; and the male genitals
								e-oure.</p><p n="444">The language is harmonious, and by no means harsh, when spoken in a
								manly manner, at Taheitee; at Huaheine, several people had the habit
								of pronouncing whatever they spoke, in a singing manner; and at the
								Friendly-islands, the singing tone of voice, in common conversation,
								was still more frequent, especially amongst women. The language of
								the Taheiteans, seems not destitute of some kind of culture, and
								shews a degree of civilization; for they have not only names for
								constellations, and single stars, for every plant or grass, but even
								for every insect, for every worm, every shell, fish, and bird,
								haunting their isle, and frequenting their shores; they have names
								also for all the parts of their body, and not only such as may be
								seen, but likewise for such as cannot be known but from dissection.
								Like the old Britons, and Northern nations, they reckon not by days,
								but number the nights, if they want to express the interval of
								several days. As their minds are most used to things that strike the
								senses, they have no proper words for expressing abstract ideas;
								thus for instance they call the thoughts the words of the belly,
								"parou no-te-oboo;" a covetous man is called tahata pirree-pirre, or
								piperriee; and it should seem they had in their minds the idea of
								narrowness, or glueing and sticking together, when they formed the
								word, for e-pirre has the above significations; a generous man is
								called t...hata-oowhoroa, or literally, the man of gifts or
								presents; the head of a human creature they call o•po; that of a
								quadruped or fish, •mee; and that of a bird p•a-araho-; the tail of
								a dog is called ...iro; of a bird, h•be; of a fish eetŠrre; this
								last name is very remarkable, because it is expressive of the use
								the fishes make of their tail; for ehoe-whateerra, signifies a
								paddle for steering a canoe, or great boat; and the eeterre of fish,
								serves likewise for the direction of its course in the water. The
								males of the human species, they express by the word t...ne; and the
								females, by that of vehene; but the males of fishes, birds, or any
								animal, are called •nee; and the females, •wha: so that from these
								few instances, we may form some idea of the characteristic points in
								their language.</p><p n="445">The common occupations of the people of Taheitee, and the
								Society-islands, as well as those in all the islands of the Pacific
								Ocean are so very little varied, that Europeans, used both to a
								variety of occupations, and a round of amusements, would think their
								way of living highly insipid and uniform; they commonly rise with
								the sun, and as they have not a variety of garments to put on, they
								wrap themselves in the same clothes which served them for a cover
								during night, then go to the river or sea, and bathe; after which
								ablution each follows some occupation, either to fish at low water
								on the reef surrounding the island, or to dig up some ground
								intended for the plantation of the cloth-tree, which is commonly
								manured with broken shells; or to collect some bread-fruit, for
								making a sour paste, to be laid up for the season when none is to be
								had on the trees; or he climbs up to the elevated vallies between
								the mountains, and fetches from thence some loads of the large
								horse-plantanes; or he is occupied in felling large trees for making
								canoes or building houses; or his time is taken up in excavating a
								canoe, or sewing the several pieces together with cords made of
								coco-nut core: at other times he plants a young plantane-shoot, and
								surrounds it with pegs and sticks, that dogs, swine, and children,
								may not hurt or destroy it: the making of fish-hooks and of lines,
								from the filaments of a grass, or of cordage of various size and
								use, from coco-nut core, is another employment, or the manufacturing
								of a lance, a war-club, a breast-plate, a scoop for the canoe, a
								paddle, or some other such instrument, used in war or peace, is
								either his occupation or amusement. About noon, having washed his
								hands, he begins his meal of bread-fruit or sour-paste baked by hot
								stones under ground, and has perhaps, his brother and son for
								companions, whilst his wife and the females of the family, retire
								with their portion to another part of the house, or wait till the
								males have finished their meal. Clear water is their common drink,
								and frequently even sea-water. Another ablution of the hands
								concludes the dinner, and if the occupations in which he is engaged
								are not pressing, he rests on the ground in his hut, or if he be
								weary from constant hard labour, whether from a long walk, or from
								hard paddling, he refuses not to refresh his exhausted spirits by a
								seasonable sleep during the heat of the day, and in the cool of the
								evening returns to his former occupations with renewed vigour, till
								the declining sun bids him rest from the toils of the day; when
								after another slight repast, and another ablution, he lays down on
								the ground on a mat, and covers himself with his garment, by the
								side of his wife; unless he finds it more necessary to go on the
								reef with lighted links, in quest of a provision of fish.</p><p n="446">The more barbarous, the less polished the manners of the nation are,
								the more marks of cruelty towards strangers are generally observed;
								and in this respect, I should think, the natives of the tropical
								islands shewed the most favourable symptoms of friendship and
								philanthropy; for as soon as our ships arrived, they were received
								in the most friendly, generous, and cordial manner: even the attack
								made upon Captain Wallis,10 I cannot suppose to have been concerted,
								unless some previous insult or offence, had been given, perhaps
								unknowingly, by our people, which roused their revenge, and as they
								were unacquainted with the effects of our fire-arms, they thought
								perhaps, they might venture an attack upon a set of men, who had
								offended or insulted them; and as the British people did not then
								understand their language, they possibly might have demanded redress
								and satisfaction for it, which, not being complied with, on account
								of the difference and ignorance of the language, they thought
								themselves in the right to retaliate the injury upon them; though
								this unlucky attempt, proved fatal to many of their brethren.
								Wherever we came, though the inhabitants had not the least idea of
								the execution our fire arms were capable of making, they behaved
								very friendly towards us: nay, after we had killed a man at the
								Marquesas, grievously wounded one at Easter-island, hooked a third
								with a boat-hook at Tonga-tabu, wounded one at Namocka, another at
								Mallicollo, and killed another at Tanna; the several inhabitants
								behaved in a civil and harmless manner to us, though they might have
								taken ample revenge, by cutting off our stragling parties; all
								which, in my opinion, sufficiently establish the friendly
								disposition of these several nations.11 </p><p n="447">We had no opportunities of seeing their method of punishing
								criminals, but we were told that thieves either hanged or drowned
								with a weight tied to their necks; in either kind of punishment are
								no vestiges of cruely. In their wars all is over after the first
								onset, and it does not appear that they take any prisoners of war,
								or if they do, that they treat them in an inhuman or barbarous
								manner. We found not even the vestiges of making slaves of them in
								the sense that Eastern nations do, or still less by employing them
								to hard and toilsome labour, as we were used to do with those whom
								we send by thousands to our colonies. All that can be said against
								their friendly dispositions, is contained in some relations we heard
								of the devastations the people of Tearraboo or the little Peninsula
								made on O-Parre, after the battle of the Isthmus: it was reported
								that they burnt houses and canoes, and carried off all their hogs:
								but even this is in my opinion, not sufficient to represent them
								more cruel than the civilized nations of Europe, who plunder, waste,
								and burn with so much eagerness, and so little concern, that if we
								judge from thence, the actions above mentioned, seem by no means to
								brand the inhabitants of the South Seas with cruelty and barbarism.
								The natives of Bora-bora had conquered O-Raiedea and O-Taha, and
								some of their chiefs and warriors had occupied the lands of such
								people as had fled the country, but except in this instance, the
								conquerors had left every thing in the old situation; even the kings
								or chiefs of these islands, were alive and free, had a district to
								govern, had honours shewn them, and if we except the supreme power,
								they had not much changed their situation for the worse. There is
								hardly an instance of such moderation to be found in Europe. They
								had however, it seems, some notions, that strangers might be treated
								with less friendship and honesty, than their countrymen, because no
								one of them hesitated a moment to steal or pilfer any thing,
								wherever he could lay his hands upon it, though they allowed it to
								be wrong, and though theft was punished in their country with
								hanging or drowning. They were, I believe, likewise in some measure
								excusable: for why came a set of strangers there, who had nothing to
								do on their shores? as they have no shipping or trade, or connexion
								with foreign nations, or any intercourse, or any wants making such
								an intercourse necessary,12 they could not foresee that they should
								ever want the protection or favour of any European, and might
								therefore think it superfluous to gain their favour by honesty: but
								the generality behaved in so friendly a manner, as must endear their
								tempers and manners to all true lovers and promoters of universal
								philanthropy. However, though we find the islanders in the South Sea
								not without hospitality, they nevertheless think the strangers not
								quite entitled to all the friendship and benevolence which they
								bestow upon their own brethren, and in this respect they perfectly
								resemble all islanders in a less civilized situation, who commonly
								have a shy, reserved, and inhospitable character. Nor are the
								inhabitants of the islands in the South Sea quite free from a
								coarseness of manners, even to indelicacy in many respects,
								especially among the lower class of people; which appears from the
								disputes of many of them, wherein they fall to beating one another
								with the fist, and pulling one another's hair: and the numerous
								opprobrious names of to-na, veheine wha-at-ree, ...iya,
								tahata-t...‹va, dooe-dooa‹, tah...ta-peepŠe ree and others,
								corroborate this assertion.</p><p n="448">The more fertile the isle of Taheitee is, and the more richly it
								affords all the necessaries of life, and even those things which
								contribute to make life easy and comfortable, the more does it
								contribute to the opulence of the greater part of the inhabitants;
								and really but very few are in such a situation, as to be called
								poor. Whenever we came to this happy island, we could evidently
								perceive the opulence and happiness of its inhabitants; and those
								people of other South Sea islands, who accidentally came to
								O-Taheitee always allowed it to be the richest land, which they had
								seen. Opulence never fails to excite the appetite for sensual
								pleasure, and if no restraint is laid on its gratification, it grows
								stronger and stronger, so as at last to extinguish all the notions
								of propriety or decency. This has been the case in all nations from
								all times. As long as the chiefs of these islanders were few, the
								rest of the nation, preserved a kind of respect for these leaders,
								who then it seems, were the heroes and best warriors of the nation.
								But opulence, the fertility of soil and climate, and idleness at
								last increased the race of chiefs to such a degree, that the wise
								men of the nation, the great chiefs of the provinces and the whole
								nation itself, could not but be alarmed at their too great number,
								and the disturbances which were doubtless too often made by an idle,
								athletic, and numerous set of men. The respect which the rest of the
								nation still had for their chiefs, and the great bodily strength of
								these drones, whose force was unimpaired by labour, and daily
								inflamed by a preternatural indulgence in the choicest fruit, and
								the fat of the land, made it more and more difficult to quell the
								riots of these turbulent men. The married women have in all these
								isles a great respect shewn to them, and their influence is great in
								all public and private affairs; and as soon as the heir of a family
								is born, the father in a certain manner loses his importance. These
								two circumstances made young men of rank and property averse to
								marriage; and as they felt the strong calls of nature under the
								influence of a powerful sun, they endeavoured to gratify their
								sensuality in such a manner as was easy and most obvious; and as the
								other sex was excited by the same causes to indulge themselves in
								sensual pleasure, the consequence was natural, that every kind of
								debauchery was introduced. These scenes of lewdness nevertheless,
								could not be at first very common; but the children who were born in
								consequence of this practice, became the object of serious public
								consideration: they had not been born in regular marriage, nor was
								it always possible to point out the true father; they were therefore
								deprived of the right of inheritance, on account of the uncertainty
								of their offspring; but continued to be stiled Arees, and were
								allowed to belong to the family of chiefs, already grown too
								numerous, turbulent, and powerful. As these chiefs, according to a
								former observation, were the best warriors of the nations, the great
								chiefs and sage men thought it prudent to institute an order of men,
								who should have great prerogatives, and great honours paid to them,
								and who were to be the chief warriors; and that they might not be
								too much attached to their wives and children, they were forbid
								marriage; and in the beginning of the institution, they were
								directed to abstain from all kinds of venery, as a practice that
								checked the boldness of spirit, and deprived men of that bodily
								strength so much required in their warriors. This society is called
								Arreeoy, and is still subsisting; though somewhat altered from its
								primitive institution.13 There is no prerogative which a man likes
								more to boast of at the Society-islands, than that of an Arreeoy;*<ref target="#jf139"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf139">* See George Forster's Voyage round the World, vol. ii. p. 130.</note></ref>
								they all belong to the class of warriors: as soon as an Arreeoy from
								another country appears, he is kindly received by the first Arreeoy,
								whom he meets; they exchange presents in cloth and garments, and he
								is entertained by his new host, with all the demonstration of
								friendship, and with the most unbounded hospitality. At certain
								stated times of the year the Arreeoys of one island remove to
								another, and there the days are spent in great feasts, wherein a
								profusion of the dainties of the country are consumed, and the
								nights are spent in music and dances, which are said to be
								remarkably lascivious, and likewise in the embraces of some girls,
								who officiate on these occasions like the priestesses and nymphs of
								the Paphian and Amathusian Goddess among the Greeks. We saw above
								seventy canoes sailing in one day from Huaheine to Raietea, with
								more than seven hundred people of both sexes on board, in order to
								assist at one of these feasts; when we arrived at Raietea, we found
								these Arreeoys removed from the Eastern side of the island, where
								they first had landed to its Western shore, and there we saw every
								house and shed crowded with people, and in every large house we
								observed heaps of provisions piled up, which were preparing by their
								women; and fishes, fowls, hogs, and dogs, were likewise dressed on
								this solemn occasion. During the night we could see these houses
								illuminated, and frequently heard the sound of their drums, which
								are used at their dramatic dances. And in a few days afterwards they
								removed to O-Tah..., and we were told, that they would even go as
								far as Bora-bora, before they would think of returning. So that
								several weeks must be spent in these feasts of Arreeoys. It is
								impossible that the frequent cohabitation with women, should not now
								and then be productive of an offspring; nay some of the modern
								Arreeoys, are so far degenerated, that they regularly keep a
								mistress, which, to all intents and purposes, is similar to a
								temporary wife, such as Muhammedans are used to marry for a certain
								time only.*<ref target="#jf140"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf140">* Chardin Voyage, vol. ii. p. 261, 263, de l'edit. in 12 mo. de 1711. Amster.</note></ref> But as this custom was contrary to the spirit of the
								original institution of Arreeoys, the Sages of the nation made
								another law, according to which, all infants, the offspring of the
								connexion of the Arreeoys with women, should be instantly killed
								after their birth; because, the increase of the Arees was thought to
								be detrimental to the state, and the original engagements of the
								Arreeoys, never to cohabit with women, would else have been entirely
								defeated. Boba, the chief of O-Taha, was an Arreeoy, and
								nevertheless kept Teinamai, as a mistress, who was with child by
								him, at our second return to the Society-islands, and told us the
								child would be stifled the moment it was brought forth. Regulation
								and custom have established this inhuman practice; and nations which
								are not yet acquainted with those refined and sublime principles of
								virtue, which are established by the introduction of christianity
								into Europe, have frequently sacrificed the observation of a moral
								or social virtue to the greater security of the state, and even to a
								device for preventing imaginary evils; nay, which is worse, to a
								method of promoting either a martial spirit, or for teaching the
								stratagems of war. Thus for instance, the Spartans now and then sent
								their youths out upon the business of killing their Helotes; or
								ordered them to steal. However, we found these inhuman practices to
								be the effects of opulence, luxury and sensuality in a nation, which
								upon the whole, is not destitute of humanity, but rather inclined to
								practice kindness and goodnature, in a manner which would do honour
								to a more enlightened and civilized race of men.</p><p n="449">The great profusion, and variety of choice fruit, delicious fish, and
								fine pork and dogs flesh, has likewise occasioned in the idle men
								belonging to the race of arees, a propensity to indulge themselves
								in the pleasures of the table beyond what is usual. To excite their
								gluttony and voraciousness, they have invented the art of dressing
								these simple gifts of providence in a variety of dishes, nay, some
								sauces have been found out for stimulating appetite, and making some
								of the insipid victuals more palatable, and the quantities of the
								various kinds of fruit and meat which these drones can habitually
								swallow are hardly credible. Nor have they omitted to devise a
								method for procuring intoxication by the juice and infusion, of a
								kind of pepper-root. This same opulence has likewise been productive
								of distinctions in dress and ornaments. Their better people wear a
								variety of cloth distinct in colour and quality, and use it perhaps
								during a few days only, when they immediately change it. The fine
								white, and very soft cloth is the dress of their chiefs, and their
								women have a kind of wrapper or petticoat of a thin dark brown
								cloth, which is perfumed with their odoriferous coco-nut-oil. Red
								and yellow cloth of a very soft texture, is likewise part of the
								dress of the people of quality. Besides the distinction in dress,
								the chiefs are always served and attended by some of the lowest
								class of people, who dress and prepare their victuals, fetch water,
								and even cram them like animals that are to be fattened, and do all
								kind of service for them; while they indulge themselves in sloth and
								idleness, bathe twice a day, repose on a matt, with a wooden small
								chair under the head instead of a pillow; and do no kind of work
								unless they walk to see a friend or relation, nor are they unlike
								our grandees, who, from mere opulence, plunge into luxury and
								sensuality, and pursue the gratification of their brutish appetites,
								with the greatest eagerness, making it a kind of occupation
								necessary for their existence; they like them roam over the fertile
								plains of their isle, in quest of youth and beauty, and employ all
								the arts and guiles known in civilized countries, in order to
								debauch the unwary young females. When we sailed from O-Taheitee to
								Huaheine and Raietea in the year 1774, a female of the last
								mentioned island embarked with us at Taheitee in order to return to
								her native island. When we approached Raietea, she became very
								apprehensive, and told me she expected to be beaten by her father
								and mother, having been very naughty, and run away from them about a
								year and a half before, with a young Arreeoy of the family of the
								chiefs, who afterwards neglected her:*<ref target="#jf141"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf141">* Capt. Cook seems to have expressed himself in such a manner, that his readers must understand that this girl was a native of O-Taheitee, and had run away from her parents in our ship; which could not be the case, since both her parents lived at Raietea; and though the circumstance happened as I related, it is equally probable, that her countrymen aimed a stroke of satire at her for running away with an arreeoy. See Cook's Voyage, p. 356.</note></ref> she was at Taheitee in the
								family of Tootaha's mother, and got her livelihood by working at the
								manufactory of the Taheitean cloth, and at the same time served for
								the gratification of the young men; in which profession she likewise
								attended our ship; and having on her return made her peace with her
								parents, she took a trip to O-Taha, when the Arreoys removed to that
								island; but returned again in a few days to Raietea: which instance,
								in my opinion, clearly proves that luxury and sensuality naturally
								lead men to the most irregular and violent desires of gratifying
								their sensual appetites, ruining innocent young women, and of
								destroying the peace and happiness of families.</p><p n="450">Among the innocent and harmless indulgences may be reckoned, the
								common practice of these islanders to rub and chase the wearied
								limbs of persons who have walked much, or used some violent
								exercise. This gentle chasing and pressing hinders the heated limbs
								from growing suddenly cold, and becoming stiff from a too sudden
								transition from one extreme to the other; and, as in these
								exertions, commonly a few muscles have been too much employed, and
								others less, it cannot but happen, that the equilibrium must be lost
								between the parts too much strained, and those which are so very
								little employed, which might cause dangerous effects, by cramps,
								convulsions, and other symptoms. The operation likewise invigorates
								the whole frame, and refreshes so much, that in the beginning I
								could not persuade myself, that this gentle squeezing of the tired
								limbs should produce so salutary an effect, had I not frequently had
								the experience.*<ref target="#jf142"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf142">* The Chinese are equally fond of the same operation. See Osbeck's Voyage, vol. I. p. 231. Nor is it unknown, that the oriental nations use this rubbing or chafing in their public baths; which is said sometimes to cause so exquisitely agreeable a sensation, that the operated person is very nearly intranced. Mr. Lockyer, purser of the Ceres East-Indiaman, communicated this circumstance to me.</note></ref> When we had walked a great deal in our excursions,
								and sat down in order to take some refreshments, the natives of
								Taheitee and the Society Islands never omitted to rub our feet and
								arms, and to add this to the many little acts of kindness and
								hospitality, which they bestowed upon us with the greatest readiness
								and chearfulness; as they themselves never failed to perform this
								service to one another, on similar occasions.</p><p n="451">The rank assigned to women in domestic society, among the various
								nations, has so great an influence upon their civilization and
								morality, that I cannot leave this subject, without adding a few
								remarks. The more debased the situation of a nation is, and of
								course the more remote from civilization, the more harshly we found
								the women treated.14 In Tierra del Fuego women pick the muscles from
								the rocks, which constitute their chief food. In New-Zeeland, they
								collect the eatable fern-roots (Pteris esculenta, Polypodium
								medullare), they dress the victuals, prepare the flax-plant, and
								manufacture it into garments, knit the nets for their fishing, and
								are never without labour and employment; whilst the surly men pass
								the greater part of their time in sloth and indolence: however,
								these are the least hardships of these unhappy females; for they are
								not only the drudges of the men, but are not even permitted to
								punish their unruly and wanton boys, who often throw stones at their
								mothers, or beat them with impunity, under the eyes and sanction of
								their fathers; and they are looked upon as beings calculated for the
								mere satisfaction of brutal appetites, nor treated better than
								beasts of burden, without being allowed to have the least will of
								their own: which incontestibly proves, how much men, in a
								degenerated and savage state, are inclined to oppress the weaker
								party.</p><p n="452"><q><emph>Et Venus in sylvis jungebat corpora amantum, Conciliabat
										enim vel mutua quemque cupido, Vel violenta viri vis, atque
										impensa libido. Lucret. lib. v.15</emph></q></p><p n="453">The females at Tanna, Mallicollo, and New-Caledonia, were not in a
								much happier condition; for, though we never knew them to be beaten
								and abused by their own offspring, they were however obliged to
								carry burdens, and to take upon themselves every laborious and
								toilsome part of domestic business. This unhappy situation of the
								females among the savage and barbarous tribes of the South-Sea, has
								nevertheless been productive of an advantage, which, in our opinion,
								should rate them above their surly lords or oppressors; for, though
								the constant acts of indelicacy, oppression, and inhumanity, are so
								far from contributing towards the real contentment of the females,
								that they on the contrary reduce them to the most wretched beings;
								yet this very oppression, and the more delicate frame of their
								bodies, together with the finer and more irritable texture of their
								nerves, have contributed more towards the improvement and perfection
								of their intellectual faculties, than of those of the males. The
								various objects surrounding them make quicker and more vivid
								impressions on the senses of the females, because their nerves are
								finer and more irritable; this makes them more inclined to
								imitation, and more quick in observing the properties and relations
								of things; their memory is more faithful in retaining them; and
								their faculties thereby become more capable of comparing them, and
								of abstracting general ideas from their perceptions. This
								facilitates to them the various operations of their toilsome,
								laborious life, and often leads them towards new improvements. Used
								implicitly to submit to the will of their males, they have been
								early taught to suppress the flights of passion; cooler reflexion,
								gentleness, and every method for obtaining the approbation, and for
								winning the good-will of others have taken their place, and must in
								time naturally contribute to soften that harshness of manners, which
								is become habitual in the barbarous races of men; and all this may
								perhaps prepare them for the first dawnings of civilization. The
								males in barbarous nations look upon the women as their property,
								and this went so far, that in New-Zeeland the fathers and nearest
								relations were used to sell the favours of their females to those of
								our ship's company, who were irresistibly attracted by their charms;
								and often were these victims of brutality dragged by the fathers
								into the dark recesses of the ship, and there left to the beastly
								appetite of their paramours, who did not disdain them, though the
								poor victim stood trembling before them, and was dissolved in a
								flood of tears.16 The barbarian knows hardly any law; the
								superiority of power decides every thing; it is therefore no wonder
								that he should extend his tyrannical sway over the weaker sex, and
								being himself a stranger to the more tender feelings of love, he is
								of course equally ignorant of the ideas of modesty, bashfulness, or
								delicacy; and if he forbids to his wife the connexions with others,
								and punishes the transgression of his commands on that head with
								great severity; it is not from the above principles, but in order to
								assert his right of property and dominion over her; for he would
								freely admit any stranger to his wife's embraces, if the equivalent
								for it were to his liking, or if prompted by some other
								consideration, which could satisfy his caprice or whim.</p><p n="454">In O-Taheitee, the Society, the Friendly Isles, and the Marquesas,
								the fair sex is already raised to a greater equality with the men;
								and if, from no other reason, from this alone we might be allowed to
								pronounce, that these islanders have emerged from the state of
								savages, and ought to be ranked one remove above barbarians. For the
								more the women are esteemed in a nation, and enjoy an equality of
								rights with the men, the more it appears that the original harshness
								of manners is softened, the more the people are capable of tender
								feelings, mutual attachment, and social virtues, which naturally
								lead them towards the blessings of civilization. In O-Taheitee, and
								its neighbourhood, the women are possessed of a delicate
								organization, a sprightly turn of mind, a lively, fanciful
								imagination, a wonderful quickness of parts and sensibility, a
								sweetness of temper, and a desire to please; all which, when found
								connected with primitive simplicity of manners, when accompanied
								with a charming frankness, a beautifully proportioned shape, an
								irresistible smile, and eyes full of sweetness and sparkling with
								fire, contribute to captivate the hearts of their men, and to secure
								to them a just and moderate influence in domestic and even public
								affairs. We find the women esteemed at O-Taheitee, and its
								neighbourhood; they mix in all societies, and are allowed to
								converse freely with every body without restriction, which enables
								them to cultivate their minds, and to acquire that polish, which
								afterwards contributes to improve the manners of their young men;
								for, as it is one of the chief points of female education, in these
								happy isles, to learn the great art to please, they are instructed
								in all the means of gaining the affection of the males, of studying
								every winning art, and of habituating themselves to that sweetness
								of temper which never fails to merit the return of attachment, of
								friendship and love. Their frequent songs, their dances, their
								innocent laughter, and humorous mirth, all conspire to make the most
								lasting impressions upon the youths of the other sex, and to cement
								an union which is dissolved only by death.</p><p n="455"><q><emph>- - - - - - Fuit haec sapientia quondam - - - - - - - - - -

								softened the manners of their countrymen, there still remain some
								strokes in their customs, which seem to prove, that the fair sex did
								not always enjoy that esteem and equality, which is now allotted to
								them. Wherever women in a nation are considered as the drudges of
								the family, there they must be contented to take their victuals
								separately from their surly lords and husbands.*<ref target="#jf143"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf143">* Labat observed, that a negro-slave did not eat with his wife and children; but after he was satisfied, he gave them leave to eat likewise; and Valentyn found the women in Amboyna serving their husbands at table, and eating afterwards in private. The Guiana-men exclude their women from their meals, and in the Caribbee Islands women are not even permitted to eat in presence of their husbands. Labat Voyage en Amerique.</note></ref> This inequitable
								custom, however, is universally received at Taheitee and its
								neighbourhood, and I was utterly unable to learn from them the true
								origin or cause of it; and in my opinion it is no more than a
								remainder of that subjection in which women formerly were held in
								the Society-Isles, before they came to their present improved
								condition.18</p><p n="457">The state of marriage ought likewise to engage our attention, as we
								are here treating of women. As far as we could observe, monogamy was
								most universally introduced among the various nations of the
								South-Sea. There were, I believe, instances, especially among the
								people of quality, that a man endeavoured to have a love-affair with
								some of the many females, who were always ready to gratify such
								votaries on the first application; but I never heard, that a married
								woman ever yielded to the embraces of any lover.</p><p n="458">As polygamy is so very common in all hot climates, and likewise among
								all barbarous nations, where women are looked upon as private
								property; it might appear very remarkable, that in the isles of the
								South-Sea, lying in a hot climate, where luxury had made a
								considerable progress,19 and where the inhabitants were remarkably
								addicted to venery;20 or at New-Zeeland, and in the more Western
								isles, where women were less esteemed, polygamy should not have been
								introduced. The reasons of this extraordinary phaenomenon are in my
								opinion to be looked for, first, in the more gentle and sweet
								manners of their females; secondly, in the equal proportion of
								females to males existing in these isles; and lastly, in the great
								facility of parting with a wife, and taking another in her stead, of
								which we had several examples. O-Amo, the husband of O-Poorea, had
								another wife when we came to O-Taheitee; nor was she without a
								person who acted the part of a husband. Potatou had taken Wainee•u,
								and parted with his wife Polatehera, who lived with Maheine a young
								Oraiedea Chief. But I find myself obliged here to confess, that I am
								not as yet persuaded of the great and universal argument for
								monogamy, viz. the equal proportion of women to men; as, in my
								opinion, it is not clearly proved, that this just proportion takes
								place in all countries and climates. On the contrary, I am of
								opinion, that in Africa the constitution of food and climate, and
								the prevailing custom of marrying many wives, have, by length of
								time, produced a considerable disparity between the numbers of men
								and women, so that now to one man several women are born. In all
								kinds of animals, it has been observed, that in the two sexes when
								coupled, the most vigorous and hottest constitution always prevails;
								so that if, for instance, the stallion be more hot and vigorous than
								the mares, and not impaired by age and too often repeated
								covering,21 the male foals in general will be more numerous; but if,
								on the contrary, the mares are more vigorous, the stallion old and
								exhausted by many copulations, their offspring will chiefly consist
								of females. If this be applied to the inhabitants of Africa, it is
								evident, that the men there, accustomed to polygamy, are enervated
								by the use of so many women, and therefore less vigorous; the women,
								on the contrary, are of a hotter constitution, not only on account
								of their more irritable nerves, more sensible organization, and more
								lively fancy; but likewise because they are deprived in their
								matrimony of that share of physical love, which in a monogamous
								condition would all be theirs; and thus, for the above reasons, the
								generality of children are born females. This observation is really
								confirmed by fact; for all the voyagers unanimously agree, that
								among all the African nations polygyny is customary;*<ref target="#jf144"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf144">* Oldendorp, (in his History of the Mission of the Moravian Brethren in the Caribbee Isles, St. Thomas, St. Croix, and St. John.

I. p. 197, says, &amp;quot;Among the Christians of Congo, polygamy is in use as formerly when they were pagans. To be confined to one wife during life, is held by the most zealous Christians there, to be altogether irrational: rather than be so confined, they would renounce Christianity.&amp;quot;</note></ref> nor has anyone
								observed, that there are many men among these nations without
								wives,=<ref target="#jf145"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf145">= Bosman's Description of the Coast of Guinea, p. 180; who likewise p. 181, expressly declares, that &amp;quot;the number of women much exceeds that of the men.&amp;quot;</note></ref> for every one is matched to one or more females. When a
								polygamous nation lives in the neighbourhood of monogamous nations,
								there is always a probability, that the women necessary for so many
								men, who have more than one wife, are obtained by stealth, by force,
								or by commerce from the neighbouring nations: but in Africa all the
								nations are polygamous, every man is married, and has more than one
								wife; he cannot procure these numerous wives from the neighbouring
								tribes, where the same custom prevails; it is therefore, in my
								opinion, a clear and settled point, that the women born among these
								nations must be more numerous than the males.</p><p n="459">Though the colonists settled at the Cape of Good Hope are monogamous,
								I observed in the various families of the town and country the
								number of females to prevail. The climate and food might influence
								them in some measure; but the chief reason which may be assigned for
								this appearance, is the licentious conduct of the young people
								there. The numerous female slaves imported from Madagascar, Bengal,
								Java, the Moluccas, and the coast of Papuas, give their young men
								many opportunities, and so great a facility of forming early and
								irregular connexions with these lascivious females, by which the
								vigour, and strength of constitution is exhausted in their males
								before marriage; that it is no wonder that the young women of the
								colony, born under a genial sun, never stinted for food, nor spent
								by labour, are more hale, vigorous, and blessed with a warm
								constitution; and that they during marriage, bring forth more
								females than males. It has been observed that in Sweden more females
								than males have been born during the latter part of this century.
								And it is reported that in the kingdom of Bantam*<ref target="#jf146"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf146">* Lord Kaime's Sketches of the History of Man, vol. i. p. 176.</note></ref> even ten women are
								born for one man. I wish therefore, that what I have here observed,
								may not be considered as a decided fact, but rather as reasons for
								doubting and continuing the enquiry with greater accuracy; as such a
								hint may lead to more authenticated facts, and serve to illustrate
								this curious part of the history of mankind. In the greater part of
								Europe it has been proved by the most accurate lists of mortality,
								that the proportion of men to women is nearly equal, or if any
								difference takes place the males born are more numerous, in the
								proportion of 105 to 100; here no doubt, providence has enforced the
								necessity of monogamy: how far the argument holds in hot countries,
								in Asia and Africa, is still uncertain. Perhaps the vicious habit of
								polygamy, has in a long succession of time inverted or viciated the
								general rule of nature, by the gradual enervation and encreasing
								weakness of males. Thus we find polygyny in one part of the globe,
								monogamy in another, and we have reason to suspect that polyandry is
								actually established at Easter-Island. In remote ages the Median
								women are said to have had several husbands at a time, and those
								were though ill provided, who were wedded to no more than five.**<ref target="#jf147"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf147">** Strabo Geogr. lib. xi. p. m. 362.22</note></ref>

It is said, &amp;quot;The inhabitants of this island do not seem to exceed six or seven hundred souls, and above two thirds of those we saw, were males.&amp;quot; The disproportion between men and women is undoubtedly greater. Capt. Cook was sickly, and did not join the expedition over the island, being too weak. I am certain their houses contained no women concealed: and am equally sure that all the women I saw, did not exceed fifty; nor is it probable that they had restrained their females from appearing during our stay, as they were by no means of a jealous disposition.</note></ref> This
								gradual diminution of inhabitants is a singular appearance; but what
								is still more remarkable, is, that among these 900 there were but
								about 50 women in all: so that the number of men to that of women
								was as 17 to one in this isle.24 This strange proportion of men to
								women, could not have taken place long before our arrival there; for
								in a few years the number of men would by death come to a par, or
								nearly so, with that of the women. I suppose therefore, that as this
								isle has the strongest marks of having been once subject to a
								violent change from a subterraneous fire and earthquake, it is
								highly probably that in a great revolution of this kind, the
								numerous inhabitants of the isle were destroyed. Nor is this
								circumstance very improbable, for Capt. Davis in the year 1687, felt
								a violent shock of an earthquake in this ocean, and not very far
								from this island.25 In Otaheitee earthquakes are known and are
								thought to be under the regulation and conduct of Maoowe a peculiar
								divinity: but this is rendered more probable from the practice of
								the inhabitants of Easter-island, who to this very day, frequently
								form their habitations under ground, and support the whole fabric by
								walls of lose stones. Now if the disaster befel the nation in the
								day time, it is probable that a great many men being out of doors
								upon some business, might be preserved, whereas the women keeping
								more at home, were involved in instantaneous ruin, by the tumbling
								of the wretched habitations, and no more than a few only that
								happened to be out of doors were spared, to become the mothers of a
								future and unhappy generation. These women we found still living in
								these huts, and they were most probably enjoyed by many husbands,
								nor were they afraid of encountering the embraces of a multitude
								from our ship, being accustomed to these rites on account of the
								reduced numbers of their sex, who were scarcely able to satisfy the
								desires of so many. If the above mentioned theory were admissible,
								and could be confirmed by facts and experience, the far greater
								proportion of boys, should be born in this isle: but the too
								numerous embraces of many might perhaps serve to frustrate the
								procreation of children, as is commonly the case with those unhappy
								females, who prostitute themselves to a multitude.</p><p n="460">These few remarks are offered in hopes of conveying some ideas of the
								different manners and customs adopted among the various nations of
								the South Sea, in regard to their women in general, and during
								marriage in particular. They lead the thinking mind towards the
								investigation of truth, and the wise dispensations of providence
								relative to the generation of man; we observe, that though in a
								higher refined, more civilized, and more moral nation, monogamy
								seems to be the true and best means for perpetuating and encreasing
								mankind; yet when man is degenerated and debased by vicious habits,
								or involved in great misfortunes, we find polygyny and polyandry
								likewise employed, though I humbly presume they may be allowed, as
								matters now stand. But in case wise legislators had any authority,
								they could not better employ it, than by persuading these nations to
								return to monogamy the primitive method ordained by providence for
								the propagation of mankind; and every encouragement ought to be
								given to so laudable a purpose.</p><p n="461">The nations of the South Sea living all in monogamy, though descended
								from the nations on the Indian continent, who almost all are
								polygamous, prove indisputably, that perhaps neither wisdom nor
								virtue prompted them to adopt this measure, but that in all
								probability the first settlers in these isles brought an equal
								proportion of men and women with them, and that accident made it
								necessary to continue the measure, and to lay aside polygamy, the
								practice of which they had been accustomed to in the mother
								country.26 The moderate size of these isles made it likewise
								necessary to continue this method; because if in a small isle, one
								man should encroach upon the rights of several men, by taking those
								females to himself, which originally were designed to be the wives
								of several, he could not remain unnoticed, and the injury done could
								not but be felt very grievously, and at length be in some measure
								repaired by restoring to every individual, what should have been his

								scrupulous in admitting some lovers to their embraces before

								think of such favours in a different light. If the birth of a child
								should happen to be the consequence, the youth is reputed the
								father, and the parents are entitled to all the privileges of
								regular marriages; if they have no issue, the female is not stamped
								with ignominy for such a trespass, but is always reputed capable of
								joining in matrimony with the best men of the nation.</p><p n="463"><q><emph>- - - - - - - - - Jam proterva Fronte petet Lalage maritum

								she had done this two or three times, she refused to go through the
								same ceremony again. I then enquired more carefully into the meaning
								of this transaction, and learnt, that in these isles, it is a kind
								of reproach, or want of dignity not to be of age, and to be
								destitute of the marks of puberty. As soon as they appear, the young
								women are obliged to undergo a very painful operation, viz. to have
								large arched stripes punctured on their buttocks: these curious

								new improvements, and to add to it new discoveries. Our art of
								writing and printing, is the most efficacious means of preventing
								the entire oblivion of many useful observations, experiments, and
								discoveries, in each branch of human knowledge. But had mankind
								lived dispersed in the woods like savages or hunters, or had they
								continually rambled over great spaces with their herds, it would
								have been equally impossible to lay up so valuable and so immense a
								transfer, to increase it so constantly, and to make the advantages
								arising from their use so easy, and so common to every individual.
								The cultivation of such vegetables as serve for food to mankind,
								enables us in an especial manner, to form numerous societies. Many
								trades and mechanical arts, want the joint efforts of many arms, to
								give them that perfection, of which they are capable; and the more
								each art and trade is subdivided into smaller branches, the greater
								is the probability of bringing it to perfection and maturity. It is
								therefore evident that no other than numerous societies, in
								countries rich in such productions as are necessary for food and
								raiment, are best calculated for the greatest improvements, and most
								likely to promote the progress of acts and sciences, and their
								various branches. Egypt, on account of its happy constitution,
								caused by the Nile's overflowing every year the flat country, became
								very early the seat of agriculture, and cultivation of all kinds of
								vegetables, and for that reason pastoral life was laid aside, and
								even abhorred; population increased prodigiously, and the mechanical
								arts, the various branches of trade, and science began to be
								cultivated, received daily improvements, and the whole circle of
								human knowledge was more and more enlarged. The countries situated
								near the mouth of the rivers Tigris and Euphrates, were much of the
								same nature with Egypt; and it was there likewise, that agriculture,
								and the cultivation of trades, arts and sciences were known at a
								time when the rest of the world was still buried in barbarism. We
								find the same climate, the same constitution of the country, the
								same early use of agriculture, and the same progress in trade, arts
								and sciences, on the banks of the Sind and Ganges in India, and of
								the Hoan-ho and Yan-tse-kian in China. After these instances, the
								fact may be supposed so well established, that no doubt can remain
								about the truth of it. And in a certain degree may we likewise
								account for the progress which the arts had made in the Friendly and
								the Society-isles: these have a considerable population, which I
								suppose, at first obliged the inhabitants to increase the native
								productions of their lands, by a careful cultivation; the mildness
								of the climate, the great fertility of their soil, the progress they
								made in agriculture, enabled them to enjoy the advantages of mutual
								assistance, and to relish the charms of society; all these
								concurring circumstances gave rise to the first notion of
								perpetuating among their progeny, those arts, ideas, and principles,
								which form their system of education.</p><p n="468">Though the more Western isles have the same advantage of a happy
								climate, are far from being barren, and the numbers of the people by
								no means inconsiderable; yet are they less improved, have fewer arts
								and improvements, and very imperfect ideas of science and useful
								knowledge; which remarkable difference seems strongly to prove, that
								there is still another great cause of the advancement of human
								knowledge in the Friendly and Society isles, but particularly in the
								latter; we have already pointed out the source of this difference,
								(chap. iv. page 315-320) viz. that the tribes from whom the two
								races of men in the South Seas descend, had unequally preserved by
								education and instruction, the systems of knowledge, which they had
								obtained from their more remote progenitors: it is therefore only
								necessary to give a more detailed idea of the education of these
								nations.</p><p n="469">The first notions necessary for the way of life now in use in these
								islands, are instilled into the tender minds of the children by
								their parents: these notions may be divided into various branches,
								as varied as the objects are to which they relate; the more
								universally necessary objects of all nations, are food, raiment, and
								shelter against the inclemencies of the weather; the operations
								therefore relative to food, dress, and habitation are the first,
								which are taught the children by their parents. As these nations
								have not yet a multiplicity of artificial wants, and as their time
								is not yet taken up with any business more material than the three
								enumerated articles, their manufactures are in consequence very
								simple, and undivided in many branches; nay, they are all thought
								necessary for every individual in these isles, and for that reason
								every child is instructed in the best methods of cultivating the
								bread-fruit tree, the plantane-stalks, the roots of yams, and other
								eatable roots; the most expeditious ways for catching fish, the
								proper season and bait for each kind, and the places which they
								haunt and resort to, are told to their children; nay, all the
								fishes, shells, and blubbers, which in any ways may with safety be
								eaten, are named and shewed to them, together with their nature,
								food, haunts, and qualities; the devices for catching birds, for
								rearing dogs, swine, and fowls, and all the names of spontaneous
								eatable plants are communicated to their youths, together with their
								seasons and qualities; so that there is hardly a boy of 10 or 12
								years old, who is not perfectly well acquainted with these articles.
								But as the bark of the mulberry tree, requisite for raiment, must be
								cultivated with a great deal of care and application, their youths
								are well instructed in the methods necessary for that purpose: and
								every young woman is early instructed in all the operations
								requisite for manufacturing and dying their cloth, and likewise in
								those of making mats, and other parts of their dress. The wood which
								is best calculated for building a house, a canoe, or other utensils,
								together with every operation for erecting a habitation, for making
								the various parts of a boat, and for navigating it by paddles or
								sails, are understood by every person, from the last toutou to the
								first chief of the land. In short, there is not one mechanical
								operation, which they do not teach to every youth, and which, after
								some time, he is not capable of executing with as much adroitness
								and skill as the best and oldest man in the nation.</p><p n="470">It might seem that after all, these are but trifles in a system of
								education; but the very existence of these islanders depends upon
								the knowledge they have of the various vegetables, their cultivation
								and preparation into food, &amp;c. &amp;c. and also of the birds,
								fishes, shells, &amp;c. which make part of their food. I had
								occasion to write down the names of 48 fishes, which they all
								reckoned eatable; and Captain Cook declared, those he had seen in
								his first voyage, and of which they heard the names from the natives
								were about 150. The very bread-fruit (artocarpus communis) called by
								the natives ooroo, has three varieties distinguished by peculiar
								names: thus for instance, the variety with more narrow pinnatifid
								leaves and oblong fruit, is called maira; another variety with
								oblong fruit, but a more rough, and as it were, scaly outside, they
								name epatŠa; and still another oblong variety, whose rind has small
								mammillary prickles or warts, bears the denomination of tatt...ra.
								Of the banana (musa paradisiaca) they enumerate at least 13
								different sorts, distinguished by different names, besides the large
								horse-plantanes: they cultivate at least two sorts of arum, viz. the
								common eddoes, with a blueish velvet leaf (arum esculentum) called
								tarro, and the large kind, with green glossy leaves, which they name
								...pe, (arum macrorhizum). Besides these varieties of plants, they
								have also a kind of excellent apples, called evŠe, nearly related to
								the Brasilian plumb (spondias). A large tree bears a kind of fruit
								involved in a stringy shell, in taste not greatly different from the
								chestnut, which they name r...tta, and we gave it the name of
								inocarpus edulis. Another large tree likewise growing in the East
								Indies, and known by the botanical name of eugenia malaccensis, is
								not uncommon in these isles; its juicy refreshing fruit is eaten in
								great quantities, and bears the name of e-h...ya: there is another
								large plant, which these isles have in common with the East-Indies,
								known in the Molucca islands by the name of pandang, in Taheitee, by
								that of e-wh ra, and to which we gave the botanical name of
								athrodactylis spinosa. (See Forster's Characteres Gen. Plant. p.
								149, tab. 75.) Its fruit grows in large clusters, and when ripe, it
								has an agreeable smell, but the taste was to me very disagreeable
								and astringent; the natives find it more palatable: the same plant
								yields to them its large leaves, which dried, are employed for
								covering, with a good thatch, the roofs of their houses: the
								male-flowers of this plant are strewed on the head in the same
								manner as powder is used by us, and its agreeable smell is reckoned
								a fine perfume for the better sort of people, and called heen...nno:
								the Banians have imported this plant into Arabia or Yemen, on
								account of its odoriferous male-flowers. Forskal believes they have
								only the male plant in Yemen, where it is called keura; one single
								spike of its flowers is sold for about eight-pence.*<ref target="#jf154"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf154">* Forskal Flora Aegyptiaco-Arabica. Havniae, 1775, 4to. page 172.</note></ref> The morinda
								citrifolia, has, in Taheitee, the name of e-n•no, and its fruit is
								sometimes eaten by the lower class of people, when they can procure
								nothing better: the roots of the tacca pinnatifida, or, as the
								natives call it, peea; those of the dracontium polyphyllum, or
								tevŠh, and of the pteris grandifolia? or e-narŠ, are frequently
								eaten; the second and last only in cases of necessity; when the
								leaves, of a kind of purslane (portulaca lutea) called e-ato•ree;
								those of a solanum or poorahŠitee, together with the stalks of the
								boerhavia procumbens, or enoona-noona are also eaten, after having
								been baked: the roots of the sweet potatoe, (convolvulus batatas) or
								e-oom...rro, and of the true yam (dioscorea alata &amp;
								oppositifolia) or e-o•whe, are regularly planted, and used as the
								best eatable during the season, when the bread-fruit is not to be
								had: the kernel covering the inside of coco-nuts, is likewise
								frequently eaten by the natives. The knowledge only of vegetables
								fit for food, forms a considerable list of names, and of ideas
								connected with them; nor have we enumerated all those which are
								occasionally eaten. In the Friendly-isles, the shaddock (citrus
								decumanus) is common, and called m•reea, or m•leea: in Mallicollo
								they have oranges: in the isle of Tanna, the eugenia iambos, and an
								other eugenia are used for food: the natives likewise eat several
								sorts of figs, and of one species the leaves are dressed in a kind
								of pie, made of yams and plantanes; the kernels of the (terminalia
								catappa) and of the sterculia balanghas, are likewise eaten: at
								New-Caledonia, the bark of the hibiscus tiliaceus, which they
								cultivate, is used for food, but is, in my opinion, a wretched kind
								of aliment.</p><p n="471">The next necessary care, after food, is raiment; and in this respect
								the natives of Taheitee, and the neighbouring isles, are certainly
								well provided; it is therefore no small trouble to teach the young
								people all the various branches of manufactures relative to
								clothing. Their dress consists chiefly of three different sorts; the
								one is a kind of cloth manufactured from the bark of trees, the
								second consists of various species of matting, serving for various
								purposes; and the last article comprehends all the different
								ornaments and dresses appropriated for certain ranks, or used only
								on certain occasions, or for performing certain ceremonies or
								religious rites.</p><p n="472">The art of making their cloth is comprehended under many
								branches.2</p><p n="473">The materials of which they are manufactured are different: in
								general the cloths are made from the bark of trees; the best sort of
								cloth is from the bark of the ao-ta, or morus papyrifera. This plant
								is very carefully cultivated, in a good and rich soil, which the
								natives take care to manure and prepare for the better growth of
								these plants, by mixing with it all kinds of shells; the ground
								which they destine for the nursery of ao-ta, is commonly enclosed by
								deep trenches, in order to prevent men and animals from hurting the
								young trees; in this soil they plant the young shoots of the ao-ta,
								in regular rows, at the distance of about 18 inches, or two feet;
								they lop off the leaves and branches that are sprouting out, which
								operation increases the main shoot, and invigorates its strait
								growth; as soon as the saplings have attained the size of an inch
								diameter, and the heighth of about six or eight feet, they are drawn
								up; the roots and tops are then cut off, and such parts of the root
								as have young shoots, are carefully preserved and planted again: of
								the strait main shoot, the bark is slit up longitudinally, and put
								into a running stream, under a board loaded with stones; when the
								water has rendered the filamentous part of the bark more flexible,
								dissolved the gummous substance which joins them, and softened the
								pulpy intermediate substance, then the women scrape the bark, in or
								near the water, on a smooth board, set in a oblique direction. A
								thin bivalve shell (tellina gargadia) is the instrument they make
								use of for this purpose, and they frequently dip the bark in the
								water during the operation; the small narrow slips thus prepared are
								carefully spread on plantane-leaves, to the breadth and length which
								the piece of cloth is intended to have, or which the quantity of
								bark will admit; and in this condition they remain a whole night,
								and from the residuous gummosity of the bark, the fine filaments are
								so closely joined, that the whole makes next day but one piece,
								after the water is drained or evaporated. Great judgment is to be
								observed in spreading the slips of bark, for as they are not of
								equal thickness, they are often obliged to mend those places where
								the bark was too thin. These large pieces are carried to sheds,
								somewhat remote from their habitations, where the women join in
								working: one or more sit at a long, smooth, square piece of timber,
								on which they beat the cloth with a square instrument of heavy wood,
								called toa; each of the sides of this instrument is furrowed
								longitudinally by close grooves, of different dimensions, and the
								side which has the coarsest grooves is applied first in beating, and
								gradually the finer ones are used, till at the last operation the
								cloth is reckoned fit for use. This beating joins the fibres so
								close together, that the whole being dry, is really of a good
								consistence, though the least moisture seems to dissolve the whole
								texture; some pieces of the best sort of bark are beaten more than
								the common, which makes the cloth fine and extremely soft, not much
								unlike our muslin. During the beating they constantly sprinkle the
								stuff with water, which stands near them in cups of coco-nut-shells;
								after this operation the cloth is bleached, and washed, to make it
								whiter and softer; sometimes they make of such soft and fine cloth,
								(called in Taheitee hoboo) several large layers, which they join by
								a kind of glue, prepared from the root of the tacca pinnatifida;
								these layers are again consolidated by beating, again rubbed, washed
								and softened, which operation makes it downy, smooth, and warm. The
								bread-fruit tree yields likewise a material for cloth; the natives
								plant the young shoots as the mulberry tree, the bark is stripped
								off, soaked, scraped, laid out, and beaten in the same manner, and
								the cloth it affords is somewhat coarser, and called too-erroo. A
								fig tree, called eao-wa, nearly related to the ficus indica, and
								another kind, called by us ficus aspera, is likewise employed, for
								making a species of cloth from its bark, which is always of brown or
								cinnamon colour; this cloth they call •ra, and the way of
								manufacturing it is not different from the method described before;
								as this cloth resists the water more than any of the other two
								sorts, it is in high request, and chiefly worn by the people of
								quality, after being previously perfumed.</p><p n="474">Not only the different of materials, but also the destination and
								colour causes various differences in the cloth: in general, every
								kind of cloth is called aho-; but a garment, chiefly of the sort
								called hoboo, intended for the women, is named paroov...i: if in the
								middle of a piece of about six feet in length, a longitudinal hole
								is cut, the natives call this dress teŠpoota; it is a very common
								garment for both sexes, who put the head through the hole, and
								suffer it either to hang lose on both sides below the knees, or they
								inclose it by another piece of cloth, coming up almost to the
								breast, and serving instead of a wrapper. Pieces of cloth are used
								by both sexes as a sash, which covers their nudities; that which is
								worn by men, they call m...ro; that by women parŠoo: red cloth is
								called ewha-...‹o; the yellow kind is named heap...; there is a
								yellow cloth on which they make red figures, by dipping a bamboo
								reed in the red die, and stamping it on the cloth, this is known by
								the name ap...; the sort which is not only brown, but covered with a
								kind of varnish or gummosity, they call poowhrree. Their dies are
								very fine and bright, and would deserve more attention if they were
								lasting: the red die requires a good deal of labour and care in
								preparing it; the fruit of a small fig called mattŠe (ficus
								tinctoria) affords a drop or two of a milky juice, when it is broken
								off from the tree; this juice is carefully gathered in a clean cup
								of coco-nut shell, and after having a sufficiency of it, they soak
								it in the leaves of the eto-, or cordia sebestena, which imbibe the
								milky juice, and soon tinge it of the finest crimson imaginable; the
								whole is gently squeezed out, and strained through the filaments of
								coco-nuts, and used to die cloth with: instead of the e-to-,
								sometimes the leaves of the tahnnoo, or tournefortia sericea, are
								employed; or those of the poho•a or convolvulus brasiliensis, or
								even those of the e-po•a or solanum repandum: the sole juice of the
								matteŠ, affords a yellow colour; but the best yellow die is made of
								the juice dripping from the peduncles of the hibiscus punctatus s.
								populneus, or e-mŠero: the watery infusion of the root of the
								e-n•no, or morinda citrifolia, dies a fine yellow; another kind is
								extracted from the tam...nnoo, or the calophyllum inophyllum: one of
								the spurges called eprree-prree, affords a hay brown colour; and
								the soaked bark of the tooto•e, or aleurites triloba, yields a gum
								or refinous substance, used by these people for varnishing their
								brown cloth (poowhirree).</p><p n="475">Mats are employed for various purposes, and are either articles of
								dress, or are used for carpeting and bedding, or form their sails;
								those for dress are chiefly worn when they go a fishing, and in
								rainy weather. The bark of the pooro-, or hibiscus tiliaceus, is
								manufactured into mats, named e-poorh•a, which are very strong, and
								look as if they were made of a coarse flax or hemp; some of them are
								very fine, but have always a kind of harshness: the mat called
								e-whar•u is made from the leaves of a species of athrodactylis: the
								finest glossy white and shining mats, called e-vanne, are made of
								the membranaceous and best prepared part of the same leaves of
								ewh...ra or athrodactylis, and sometimes of a kind of grass: another
								and very strong sort, manufactured of rush, is used to sleep on,
								which even the name of MoŠya seems to imply: very nearly related to
								it is the sort, which is often striped or checked with black, and
								used occasionally for carpeting, or to dance on, in their dramatic
								pieces; these last mats are 20 or 30 yards in length; the bark of a
								tree, which I could never discover, forms their largest and very
								strong mats, called hoh•ra, one of which, when expanded upon a
								semi-oval frame, is an eya or sail for their canoes.</p><p n="476">The Taheiteans have various ornamental and ceremonious dresses, which
								they manufacture in a most ingenious manner. After the death of a
								person of some note, one of the next relations puts on a kind of
								masquerade dress, called by them HŠva, which is very remarkable, as
								well on account of its curious workmanship, as the strange
								assemblage of its parts and extraordinary appearance.3 The
								enumeration of all the pieces belonging to it, with a short
								description of them, will not perhaps be thought superfluous, as it
								may set the arts of this people and their curious contrivances in no
								improper light. The first part of this dress they call Ta-o•po or
								head-piece; it is formed of a piece of mat tied together into the
								form of a cone or a cap, to which they paste a piece of cloth
								reaching to the neck and shoulders, and covering the ears; they
								paste alternately red, brown and white transversal slips, in order
								to make this cap, and on its top they place a thick garland of
								glossy dark green pigeon feathers, to which sometimes red or yellow
								feathers are joined in small bunches, made of coco-nut filaments,
								the whole is encompassed by a kind of rope, formed of two kinds of
								Taheitee cloth, and other strings, tied together by the bark of
								various kinds of convulvuli, died black and red; this is called
								Moyh•. The next piece consists of several parts, the first of which
								is named pa-tŠea to which they fasten the pa-raŠ, or frontlet; the
								pa-o•to, or mask before the mouth; and lastly, the hoop..., or
								stomacher, which form the most curious part of the whole dress. The
								pa-teŠa is a large shell, of the oyster kind; they polish away its
								rough outside, and leave only a brown coating, which gives it much
								the appearance of turtle-shell; this shell is perforated on its
								margin by many small holes, which serve to fasten to it a border of
								shining dark green pigeons feathers, fixed on a plaited list of
								coco-nut filaments, and into this margin they fix a great quantity
								of tail-feathers from the tropic bird in a diverging manner; so as
								to appear like the rays of a luminous body: the pa-r...e is commonly
								joined to the pa-teŠa by strings; this is again a shell of the same
								kind as the former, and has a very narrow hole, through which the
								person looks who wears the mask: below this is the pa-ootoo, or a
								thin black board, of the form of a segment of a circle, about a yard
								across, and about six or seven inches wide, to which they fix five
								mother of pearl shells, polished on both sides, on the extremities
								the two shells are again fringed, with pigeons feathers, as in the
								pa-teŠa, and from them they suspend two tassels, of about 18 inches
								long, made of pigeons feathers, called •rro-•rro: the hoopa is made
								of small pieces of mother of pearl, of about an inch and a half, or
								two inches long, and one or two tenths of an inch wide, with a hole
								on each end, by which these small pieces are fixed in rows, so as to
								form a kind of apron or stomacher, there are sometimes 15 or 20 rows
								of these small pieces, in one hoopa. If we consider, that these
								holes are all bored by other sharp shells or bones, that the pieces
								must be ground of equal length and width, and then fastened in such
								a manner as to lie flat, it must be obvious, that the making of more
								than 2000 small pieces of mother of pearl, and the joining them
								together, is a work of immense labour, requiring much time and an
								unwearied patience, and what is still more, a nicety and accuracy in
								executing them, all of equal length and width: the par...e
								therefore, or the compound of these four pieces, is reckoned among
								the natives one of their most curious ornamental dresses; and which
								they seldom part with, unless for a very valuable consideration.
								Next to this follow the ahou-aiboo, which is a strong teŠpoota,
								covered on its foreside with circular pieces of coco-nut shell, of
								about an inch and a half diameter, and disposed in rows; the
								ahou-aiboo is put over two other teŠpootas, the lowermost of which
								is white or red in the widest, the next is brown and narrower, and
								the ahou-aiboo is the narrowest of all: these ahous they gather by a
								belt of two kinds of cloth, twisted together into a rope, and called
								nao--nao-: over all this they spread on the back of the chief
								mourner a kind of mantle, made of netting of strings, and covered on
								the outside with glossy pigeons feathers; this cloak they call
								ahou-ro•pe; in one hand the masked man, performing the ceremony,
								wears two strong mother of pearl oyster-shells, which he knocks
								against one another, and causes a loud noise, announcing his
								approach; these clappers are called tettŠ; the p...yho is held in
								the other hand, and consists of a stick, into which a row of sharp
								shark's teeth is fastened, with which they cut the people, who may
								happen to be dilatory in retiring at the approach of the solemn
								procession.*<ref target="#jf155"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf155">* In Hawkesworth's Compilation, vol. ii. p. 234, plate No. 5, and in Captain Cook's Voyage, vol. i. p. 185, plate 44, is a representation of a man dressed in the hŠva or mourning dress: but it must be observed, that the tropic bird's feathers go not beyond the ta-oopo, and are never fixed to the pa-teea, as has been improperly represented in the plate, drawn by Mr. W. Hodges.</note></ref> All the parts of this one dress are the most ingenious
								and most compound work they have on their isles, and must of
								consequence require a peculiar handiness and skill in executing with
								so much neatness and elegance.</p><p n="477">The chief warriors who fight on the stages of their war-canoes, have
								likewise a dress peculiar to themselves, whose fabric requires some
								labour and ingenuity. The awho- is a helmet of more than five or six
								feet high, formed of wicker work into the shape of a long cylinder;
								to this they add a frontlet, which is between three and four feet in
								length, it covers the front of the helmet or the half of the
								cylinder; towards the top however it does not lie close to the
								cylindric basket, but projects somewhat forward in a hollow shape;
								all this frontlet is covered with green glossy pigeons-feathers;
								sometimes they form of white feathers one or more borders round the
								whole frontlet, and to its outer edge they fix a great number of
								tail-feathers of the tropic-bird in a diverging manner, which gives
								the warrior a very grand appearance. These machines can by no means
								be worn, because they are so unwieldy, and at the same time so
								light, that the least breath of wind must almost overset the man,
								who should presume to wear one of them; so that I am of opinion
								these helmets are more for shew than real use, in defending the head
								against stones, or blows of clubs, and lances; it may possibly serve
								as a standard, to rally the troops about their leaders, which is not
								quite improbable, as we saw only single helmets in one or two war
								canoes, in a fleet of 169.**<ref target="#jf156"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf156">** In Sydney Parkinson's Journal, of a Voyage to the South-Seas, plate xi. page 71; and in Capt. Cook's Voyage, vol. l. plate No. 61, p. 342: representation of this helmet may be seen; that in Parkinson gives by far the best idea of it.</note></ref> The warriors on the fighting-stage wear
								almost universally the gorget or breast-plate, called ta-•mee,
								likewise made of wicker-work, covered with semi-circular lifts of
								coco-nut fibres, which again are bedecked with shining glossy
								pigeons feathers, set off with two or three semi-circular rows of
								sharks-teeth, all which are bored and fastened to the breast-plate
								by strings; the whole gorget is fringed with long white dogs hair,
								imported from the Low-isles to O-Taheitee, and the Society-isles; on
								the top there are likewise mother of pearl shells, fringed with
								pigeons feathers; this breast-plate is hung on the neck by a string,
								and defends the breast against the thrust of one of their lances,
								headed with spines of the sting-ray.Q<ref target="#jf157"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf157">Q A good and faithful representation of one of these breast-plates may be seen in Hawkesworth's Compilation, vol. ii. p. 184, plate No. 8, drawn and engraved by Mr. James Roberts.</note></ref> The making these war-dresses
								requires very curious and dextrous workmanship, and likewise a good
								deal of time and patience.</p><p n="478">The manufacturing various baskets, stools, cloth-beaters, and other
								utensils, tools, and instruments, in use among these nations, is so
								multifarious, that a minute description of them would require too
								much time; we must not therefore enter upon the detail, but will
								confine ourselves to a brief description of the third great branch
								of mechanical arts, exercised by these people, and relating to the
								building of their houses. The materials, size, and destination of
								their houses and buildings, constitute their difference. The wood of
								the a-ho•doo, or barringtonia speciosa, of the inocarpus edulis, or
								r...tta, of the evee, or spondias pomifera, of the tam...noo or
								calophyllum inophyllum, and of the o•roo or artocarpus communis, are
								the various materials used in building their houses. The natives
								call in general a house te-wh...rre; some are small and round, and
								are called te-wh...rre-potto; those which are very large and long,
								are named tewh...rre t...rra; and besides these, they have houses or
								sheds to shelter their large double war-canoes. The common houses
								are from 15 to 20 feet long, and 10 or 15 wide, the roof eight or
								nine feet high in the middle, and about five or six feet on the
								sides, though the eves project a good way beyond the sides, or
								posts.</p><p n="479">The houses are all built with three rows of posts, supporting the
								roof (er...-woro): the middle row of posts, (ep•-oo) is about 16 or
								20 feet high in the large houses, and from eight to ten in the
								common or smaller ones; they support a beam, forming the ridge of
								the roof, (tocore-yore) on which they fix the timbers, or spars of
								the roof, (ahŠo) which are again borne by a long beam, called
								ep...i, under which a row of side-posts (tooto-•roo) is placed,
								standing on another beam (too-...rroo) that rests on the ground:
								some times they fill these spaces between the beams and posts on the
								sides of the house with bamboos, and this method of building they
								call parooroo, but commonly all the underside is open. The roof
								itself is formed of the leaves of the athrodactylis indica. Now and
								then I observed the house open, but furnished below at the height of
								about one foot, with a fence of bamboos. Some small houses are
								likewise included in a kind of partition made of small sticks in the
								manner of hurdles. The natives commonly keep their hogs during the
								night, in the house, and have in one corner of it contrived an
								inclosure (pa bo•a) covered on the top with boards, on which they
								sleep.</p><p n="480">The large war-canoes cost the natives infinite labour, and afford the
								best specimens of their genius, industry, and mechanical arts; it is
								therefore no wonder that they should be very careful in the
								preservation of these large boats, which are the very means of their
								preservation and liberty, against the invasion of their enemies.
								Huaheine has in its neighbourhood the isles of O-Raietea, Taha,
								Borabora, and Mourooa, all under the dominion of O-Po•nee a powerful
								chief, who conquered Raietea and O-Taha, and would likewise have
								extended his dominion over Huaheine; but the inhabitants of this
								island, with their chief Oree, were attentive to their true
								interest, and for that purpose kept constantly a large fleet in
								readiness under the above mentioned sheds. It was here likewise that
								I observed a double war-canoe, which required 144 paddles, and eight
								or ten steersmen to move it forward; the stage for fighting was
								roomy, and could contain about 30 men. These boat-houses are
								sometimes 40 or 50 or more yards long, about ten yards wide, and the
								eves of the roof are brought down within two or three feet of the
								ground. Sometimes the sides of the roof are in the shape of segments
								of a circle meeting at the top.</p><p n="481">As I have here mentioned the large war-canoes of these nations, I
								will give a few hints relative to the structure of their boats. The
								inhabitants of the Society-isles distinguish their smaller canoes
								(E-w...ha)*<ref target="#jf158"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf158">* The name E-w ha is certainly pronounced by the natives of the Friendly-isles and in New-Zeeland with a stronger founding of the aspirate h, by saying Te-wagga. In like manner the word TeŠhee is changed into Te‚ghee, the word Tahata into Tangata, E-hoe or Ehohe is in New-Zeeland Hogghee, Tohee is Togghee, Tareha is Taringa, Toohana is Tooghana, &amp;amp;c. &amp;amp;c.</note></ref> from the larger ones, (pahŠe) and these are again
								different as their uses, for fishing, for long voyages from isle to
								isle, and for war. The latter have high sterns, and two of these
								boats being always tied together, towards the head of them stands a
								stage or platform (Eto•tee) raised on six or eight pillars about
								four or five feet high, and proportioned to the size of the boat.
								The warriors stand on these stages and fight the enemies who defend
								the shore. The boats are commonly built of the timber of the E-avŠe
								or Spondias pomifera or the E-m rra or Nauclea orientalis. The keel
								is one piece of timber hollowed out, in the shape of a trough; in
								very large boats they employ more than one piece for the keel, but
								never exceed three. The next board is set on the keel in a diverging
								direction; the third board has a convex shape on its outside, but on
								the inside is concave, and the last board is set on this bilging
								board: these four boards are fitted amazingly tight and close, and
								afterwards fastened by cordageQ<ref target="#jf159"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf159">Q The most antient and most simple manner of constructing embarkations, before the use of nails and iron to fix the planks to the knees and timbers, seems to have been that of sewing them together with strings. Plin. Hist. Nat. lib. xxiv. v. 40. Cum sutiles sierent naves, lino tamen, non sparto unquam sutas.4 In the ninth and tenth century of the Christian Aera, when all the vessels in the Mediterranean Sea were nailed together, a vessel was stranded on some part of the Syrian Coast, whose planks were all sewed together: this the author of the voyages to China of some Mahammedan travellers, published by Renaudot, p. 53, declared to be an Arabian vessel from Shiras, whose construction is such that the planks are not nailed, but joined together in a peculiar manner, as if they had been sewed, &amp;amp;c. &amp;amp;c. When the more civilized nations had better contrivances for the construction of their ships, by means of iron nails and bolts, the custom of sewing the planks of vessels together, was left to those that were less acquainted with the arts. The whole East has now the use of iron, and the custom of sewing the planks of embarkations is only found in the isles of the South Sea.</note></ref> made of the filaments surrounding
								the coco-nuts; and drawn together, that these vessels are
								sufficiently water-tight, without any caulking; and though in the
								larger boats one person is constantly employed in baleing out the
								water, it never gains upon them. The head and stern are carved and
								commonly represent a rude figure of a man, called by them E-teŠhee;
								which might be compared with the tutelar genius of the antient
								Romans and Greeks. Boats used for long voyages have on their
								foreparts small huts covered with thatch, and defended on one or two
								sides either with boards, or a partition of bamboos, and lined
								besides with mats, here the chief people sit by days, and sleep at
								night. The rest of these boats are nearly of the same structure with
								the war-boats; they have a mast, (E-teŠra) a sail of mats in a frame
								(Eiya); at the top of the mast they carry a bush of young branches
								of a tree, this bunch of rods is named E-whatev..., and from the top
								of the mast, or the uppermost part of the frame of the sail, one or
								two long garlands of feathers are hanging down called Matttee. When
								they do not join two boats together, but have only one, across the
								middle of it a long beam is fixed, (Pat•a) to which they fasten on
								one side small pieces of wood pointing downwards and joined to a
								piece of spar, shaped like a keel, i.e. triquetrous, which is nearly
								of the same length with the boat. This out-rigger they call E-o...,
								and it is fastened besides to the canoe by one or more cross beams.
								Such an apparatus must hinder the boat from oversetting, and hardly
								retards the motion of the boat. The swift proas at the
								Ladrone-islands described in Lord Anson's voyage round the world,
								give the best idea of the utility of this apparatus.5 To the
								projecting cross beams about the mast, the shrowds are fastened, and
								on the side opposite to the out-rigger, they fasten sometimes a
								large stone in order to trim the boat by it.</p><p n="482">The fishing boats are not unlike those intended for voyages, only the
								whole appartus is meaner, and the hut is less elegant, if any should
								happen to be fixed on the boat. This account will convince us that
								the natives of these isles are not deficient in the knowledge and
								practice of mechanical arts, and that they carefully preserve this
								knowledge, by early instructing their young people in all that
								belongs to their food, raiment, and habitations. If we consider that
								a stone adze, a chissel of the same materials, or of bone, and a
								piece of rough coral rock, together with a saw made from a part of
								the sting-ray's skin fastened round a piece of wood, are all the
								instruments to assist them in the structure of their houses and
								boats, we must certainly give ample testimony to their ingenuity.
								Their mechanical genius I particularly admired, having an
								opportunity of seeing one day a man busy in sewing a large canoe
								together: he employed a stick with a forked branch for the purpose
								of drawing the string more powerfully together; one of these
								branches he fixed against the lowermost plank; and to the other he
								had fastened the string or rope, which gave him an amazing purchase,
								and as soon as the string or rope was stretched to its utmost, an
								assistant struck a peg into the hole through which the string
								passed, to prevent its given way again. Their methods of fishing and
								the several implements used for that purpose, afford many instances
								of their genius and spirit of observation. They make harpoons of
								reed (E-t...o-werro-eiya) pointed with a hard wood shaped in the
								manner of the bearded head of an arrow. Their large seines (oopŠa)
								are employed in shoal water only, and are of great extent and made
								of a kind of phaseolus and of a convolvulus. Their hooks (Matto-)
								are formed of pieces of shells; those for catching of small fish are
								very neat, small, and of one piece; those for fish of a middle size,
								are made of mother of pearl-shell, and composed of two pieces, the
								shank is formed of the most bright and glossy part of the shell, and
								the hook is fastened to it by strings passing through some holes
								bored through both pieces, and for the better decoying the fish,
								they add some hair, feathers, or tufts of thread to represent the
								fins of small fish; this kind of hook they call vttee-vttee: the
								largest of all have a shank made of wood or bone covered with a
								brown mother of pearl-shell, and have a hook of tortoise-shell,
								which often is made of two pieces tied together. The strings for
								these hooks are made of a kind of nettle (urtica argentea) Ero•a
								which holds the strongest fish, (viz.) the Bonito or Peer...ra
								(Scomber pelamys), the Albecore or E...hai (Scomber Thynnus), and
								the Dolphin or E-o•ma (Coryphaena Hippurus): for all other purposes
								they use strings and ropes made of the Em•hoo or Cyperus alatus, the
								bark of Poor•u or Hibiscus tiliaceus, the bark of M...ttee or ficus
								tinctoria and the EpeŠpee or phaseolus amoenus. They make use of
								several plants and fruits, which when bruised and mixed with some
								minced meat of shell or cray-fish, and thrown into the sea inebriate
								fish to such a degree, that they may be caught by the hands, the
								chief fruit thus employed is that of the Barringtonia speciosa or
								E-Ho•doo, and the leaves are those of the Daphne foetida or O...o,
								the Galega piscidia or Eh•ra, and Lepidium Piscidium or En•u. When
								they discover out at sea a quantity of birds hovering over a certain
								spot, they are sure that a number of fish is assembled there, and
								they hasten there with their sailing canoes and several
								vittee-vittees hung out on each side by a bamboo projecting from the
								canoe at a good distance, and they never fail to catch a great
								number of these fish. Thus we find that the attention which they
								bestowed on the various kinds of fish and their nature, gave them
								opportunities of making proper use of these observations for better
								and easier catching these animals, which make so material a part of
								their animal food.*<ref target="#jf160"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf160">* The inhabitants of the Maledives are likewise very expert in catching all kinds of fish, with which their sea swarms; and as animal food of quadrupeds is not very common with them, fish are their most material food. See Fran‡ois Pyrard's Voyage, 4to. Paris, 1679, Part i. p. 88, 136, and 166.</note></ref></p><p n="483">The most necessary ideas relative to food, garment, and habitation,
								form the first part of the education thought to be necessary among
								these islanders. The fertility of these isles, the mildness of their
								climate, together with the happy and joyful temper of their
								inhabitants, give them a general turn for sensual pleasures: the
								least happy occurrence in life is sufficient to inspire them with a
								high degree of glee, which sets their whole body in motion: they
								begin to frisk and dance, this makes a cadenced or measured
								breathing necessary; if in this situation man wishes to communicate
								his ideas to the by-standers, he will naturally give his words that
								kind of measure or cadence, which he has adopted with his breathing,
								this, together with the voice of exultation may be considered as the
								first origin of singing and music: if the ideas he wants to express
								by words, are the true feelings of the man, they will of course be
								more animated; the images rush forth with uncommon rapidity, he has
								not time to express the idea itself, he substitutes therefore any
								thing nearly related or similar to it, he pursues every lively
								quality of the thing or person he speaks of, and thus gives rise to
								poetry, its imagery, metaphors, similes, and the frequency of
								epithets. When these arts have subsisted in a country for some time,
								the inhabitants find likewise a pleasure in representing by mimic
								actions and words certain well known scenes of life, interspersed
								with some coarse jokes, and some strokes of unpolished wit. The
								better they are able to imitate the true characters, the stronger
								they express the disharmony or disproportion of these actions or
								characters, and the greater is the pleasure they procure to their
								audience; and thus do they give life and existence to the drama, a
								new kind of diversion. After these arts have once been applauded and
								become fashionable in a nation, it is very natural that either
								parents or some other persons, who have attained to some degree of
								perfection in these arts, should communicate to the rising
								generation the principles upon which they acted in order to obtain
								some eminence in their profession: and thus the second part of
								education is carried on among the more polished nations of the South
								Sea. Their dances, poetry, music, and dramas, are however by no
								means to be considered as performances which have any degree of
								perfection or excellence; they are the first rude beginnings of
								arts, and for that very reason they are in more general use, than
								the same arts are among us: females commonly dance at Taheitee and
								the Society-isles and men but seldom; however they are all
								acquainted with the steps and motions usual in this diversion. Every
								individual can compose verses extempore, and sing them at the same
								time; and their dramatic performances are commonly extemporaneous
								pieces, and a mixture of music, poetry, and dancing, so that the
								Improvisadores might here find in the opposite hemisphere people
								possessed of this admired qualification.6</p><p n="484">The measured steps of their women, keep excellent time with their
								drums, which are beaten by fingers briskly and loud, and commonly
								accompanied by songs. The dress of the women in the greater dramatic
								dances has already been described,*<ref target="#jf161"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf161">* See Hawkesworth, vol. ii. p. 264, and George Forster's Voyage, vol. i. p. 399, and following.</note></ref> and is not peculiarly connected
								with that art; however so much appears from their clothes collected
								into long petticoats, that they by no means think the excellence of
								the performance to consist in the graceful motion of the feet, as
								they carefully cover them; but in the motion of their hands and
								fingers, they shew in my opinion, the greatest dexterity and
								elegance. They have generally long well shaped fingers, which are
								wonderfully pliant, so that they can with ease bend them so far back
								as to form with the rest of the hand a segment of a circle, and in
								this attitude they move them with a astonishing agility. This dance
								is called HeŠva-he-o•ra, and the motion of the fingers E•ree. But
								besides this, they shake their hips in a rotatory motion, both when
								they are standing and when they are leaning prostrate on their knees
								and elbows, with a velocity which excited our astonishment, and this
								is named •ne-•ne. There are other dances wherein they use measured
								steps, hold another by the hands and clap with them; which is called
								pa-...ta. During the various kinds of dances, they never fail to
								make wry mouths, which, in our opinion, were the most extravagant
								and disgracing distortions, instead of being capable of giving the
								spectator ideas of gracefulness and harmony: habit has taught them
								to screw the mouth into an obliquely slanting direction by a kind of
								sudden convulsive motion of the lips, and custom only has made the
								sight of so unnatural and offensive a grimace a performance which
								pleases and merits applause. This distortion is called ootoo-r•a
								(large lips). There are other dances usual in their nocturnal
								festivals with the Arreeoys, which, none of our ships company had an
								opportunity of seeing, and are according to the accounts of the
								natives extremely indecent and lascivious; these are called
								t'e...i-morodŠe, and the women exhibiting them, Too-...ha. The
								exercise of the common dramatic dances is very violent, the motion
								of the hands elegant, that of the feet not to be seen, that of the
								hips somewhat strange, and according to our notions indelicate; and
								lastly, that of the mouth horrid and disagreeable. The women when
								performing were always attended by a man, who accompanied the drums
								with a kind of song; and by some loud spoken words or the clapping
								of hands, directed their motions; which, in my opinion seems to
								intimate that they have a kind of plan in their dances, and that the
								transitions from the oblique steps, to the motion of the fingers and
								agitation of the hips, is in some measure connected with the words
								spoken by the master of the ballet.</p><p n="485">Their music is by no means so perfect or harmonious as their dances
								or poetry: this branch of the polite arts having made but an
								indifferent progress among them. The flute in the hands of a
								Taheitean has no more than three holes, and is therefore incapable
								of a variety of notes, and the music they execute upon this
								instrument is but a poor humming: even their vocal music has no
								greater compass than three or four notes, however some of their
								songs were not quite disagreeable. The inhabitants of the Friendly
								Islands are better versed in music than the Taheiteans, and the
								tunes of their women had something pleasing to our ears when we
								first heard them at E-Aoowhe or Middleburgh. The inhabitants of
								Tanna*<ref target="#jf162"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf162">* When we were at Tanna, we heard every morning at day-break a solemn song, issuing as it were from the point lying to the East of the harbour, and this circumstance seems to prove that the natives of this island employ even their Music as part of their solemn worship of their Deity. We were still more confirmed in our suspicion, when we two or three times attempted to visit this Eastern point, and always found the natives ready to defend the sacred place by arms. See likewise George Forster's Voyage, vol. ii. p. 300, and 362.</note></ref> and New-Zeeland have in their songs greater variation and
								extent, which certainly intimate better and more improved talents
								for this branch of the polite arts.</p><p n="486">The verses of the Taheiteans are always delivered by singing, in the
								true antient Greek style, and what is still more remarkable, we
								found that many of these verses were the productions of the moment,
								for we observed that their poetry had some relation to the persons
								on board our ship, or to some transactions which happened during our
								stay: but they had likewise many couplets or songs which had no
								reference to the persons or transactions occasioned by the presence
								of our ship. Their verses seem to be regularly divided into feet,
								and they observe the quantity and express it in singing. As to the
								beauties of their poetic style, we were not able to judge of them;
								because we were not sufficiently acquainted with their language;
								thus much however we observed that many words occurred in their
								poems which were not used in common conversation. The women on board
								our ship, seeing in the night the moon shine, frequently sung the
								following couplet or pehai.</p><p n="487"><q><emph>T oo | wá no | t M lámá T oo | wá t h-- | n
								ro</emph></q></p><p n="488"><q><emph>The cloud within the moon That cloud I love!</emph></q></p><p n="489">We will transcribe one couplet from Hawkesworth which the natives
								composed when the Endeavour was at O-Taheitee.**<ref target="#jf163"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf163">** Hawkesworth, vol. ii. p. 205.</note></ref></p><p n="490"><q><emph>Epáh | t y | M lámá | t iy N Táb | n to n t | wá whánno | m

										Banks, while to his friends he flew.</emph></q></p><p n="492">From the purport of this couplet it appears, that it was made when
								the moon was shining; and it may likewise be observed, that the
								syllables at the end of each verse form rhymes, which cannot be
								thought to be the effect of accident, though all the other couplets
								in Hawkesworth, together with these two now before us, are without
								rhyme. From whence it seems to follow, that their poetry admits both
								of rhymes and of blank verse.</p><p n="493">Another such couplet was frequently sung on board the Resolution, in
								1774.</p><p n="494"><q><emph>Awá | h-- t páh-- | n Toot- T n-- | t T o | r e h ro á -

								quantities are perfectly true, but hearing the words, or reading
								those in Hawkesworth, we supposed that the quantities were such as
								we have marked over the words. In their prayers, and likewise in
								their dramas and on other solemn occasions,*<ref target="#jf164"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf164">* When we were in New Zeeland and the man in Dusky Bay was willing to come on board our ship, he pronounced a carmen or speech in a very cadenced and solemn manner, which lasted about two minutes, holding at the same time a green branch in his hand, as soon as he had finished this ceremonious formule, he struck the ship with the branch just as he had done before he began the ceremony, and then threw the branch into the ship. In Queen Charlotte's Sound, a party of Indians came on board our ship, whom we had not seen before, and one of them held a green flag in his hand, while another person delivered a long, solemn, and cadenced speech. The ceremony and solemn prayer of Tupaya on the first landing at Huaheine seems to have been of the same nature, and it was repeated by him on the first landing at O-Raiedea. See Hawkesworth, vol. ii. p. 251, and 256.
									At our first landing in New-Caledonia, the Chief Te-abooma, and another Chief pronounced some cadenced, solemn speeches, intermixed with some short responses from certain old men. See George Forster's Voyage, vol. ii. p. 382. All which not only proves that the first interview and making of peace is a solemn act observed by nations of very different origin, and living at a considerable distance from one another, but also that their solemn speeches on these occasions are a kind of poem or cadenced metrical performance.</note></ref> the language is
								different from what we used to hear in their common conversation,
								and might justly be stiled a cadenced metrical performance or a
								carmen in the acceptation of the word as it is used in the formule
								delivered by the Roman Feciales, Livii. Hist. lib. i. cap. 24.</p><p n="496">To the last branch of the liberal and polite arts exercised by the
								natives at Taheitee and its neighbourhood, belong their dramatic
								performances. These are blended with dances and songs, with this
								restriction, that men only are the acting persons, in the same
								manner as at Rome, where no females were permitted to act. The drama
								is a simple representation of the common occurrences of life. A man
								entrusts his servants with the care of his goods, they fall asleep,
								and though they are lying on their masters property, the thieves are
								subtle enough to steal them away from under the persons who were
								appointed to watch them; sometimes the thieves are detected and
								severely beaten, and sometimes they return the blows. In another
								farce, a man has a daughter, who has a lover; the father dislikes
								him and refuses his daughter, and being afraid of being deceived he
								watches her closely, but in the dead of the night, the lover meets
								the fair one and persuades her to run away with him; the consequence
								of this affair is the birth of a fine boy; the lady is in labour on
								the theatre and at last a large boy is exhibited, who immediately
								runs about the stage with the placenta and long funis umbilicalis;
								which is here not considered as indelicate, because every body is
								acquainted with the incident, the children of four or five years not
								excepted; and the oddity that the new-born child runs about and
								escapes the midwife, whose business it is to catch him, causes an
								universal and loud peal of laughter. The girls father upon seeing
								the cleverness of his grandson, is at last reconciled to his
								son-in-law.</p><p n="497">Of this turn (though not in every particular) was the little
								extempore farce seen by some of our friends at Huaheine, and which
								seemed to be levelled at a girl, a native of O-Raiedea, who came
								with us from Taheitee in order to return to her parents, from whom
								she had eloped some months before with a young Arreoy. Though the
								piece was but rudely performed, it however put the girl to shame,
								and drew tears from her eyes, which naturally must have a good
								tendency, especially with such persons of her sex as might be
								tempted to follow her example. Upon the whole, this circumstance
								gives us a very good idea of the nation in every respect: If we
								consider the poor girl, who was thus exposed, her bashful behaviour
								and her tears are certainly irrefragable7 proofs of her modesty and
								repentance. In a genial climate, with a warm consitution, a feeling
								heart, and an education which made her acquainted with all the
								mysterious parts of love, even though she should not chuse to put
								them in practice, it was no wonder she yielded to the tender
								solicitations of a youthful and vigorous lover, when her own age and
								the natural levity of the whole nation, contributed to lessen the
								crime of her inconsiderate step, and still more so, the possibility
								of obtaining a husband without hurting her character. On the other
								hand, there is something so generous in her behaviour that I cannot
								help taking notice of it. She became the object of indelicate, but
								sharp and salutary satire, and gave by her tears ample testimony of
								the immorality of her behaviour, and that she felt herself aggrieved
								under self-condemnation, and was not unwilling to become a fair
								warning to a whole croud of young persons of her own sex. If again
								we consider the actors who took the opportunity of exposing
								immorality for the instruction of the rising generation; they must
								be thought highly commendable for having dared to lay aside for so
								salutary a purpose, the respect due to a lady and a stranger. She
								was under the protection of a set of foreigners, whose fire-arms
								indeed commanded respect; but these censors were not to be
								brow-beaten by power, or awed to silence by wealth, as is too often
								the case in Europe; they failed not to point the shafts of their
								satire at an object deserving censure, without regarding the
								consequences which might accrue to themselves from thence, being
								fully convinced of the rectitude of their action, and the salutary
								effects that might be derived for the benefit of the rising
								generation. Lastly the whole audience deserved in my opinion,
								likewise to be commended; for when the witty sarcasms were falling
								from the lips of their theatrical heroes, they laughed at their
								jokes; but when they observed that these shafts of satire were not
								discharged at random, but made the person smart who was the object
								of their instructive irony, when they saw the marks of returning
								modesty of repentance and self-condemnation, in the attempts to hide
								her shame, and in the copious tears of the poor girl; many an eye
								was moistened, and many a heart sympathized with her; lastly, when
								the dramatic performance was over, every one was eager to give her
								the most unfeigned and unsolicited marks of his esteem and
								friendship, to comfort her in her distress and affliction, to
								countenance her modesty and return to her duty; and in a manner to
								thank her for having contributed to the innocent mirth,*<ref target="#jf165"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf165">* Thanks were returned to Lucius by the magistrates of a town in Thessalia, for having contributed to their mirth in his sham-tryal.

								to the instruction and the warning of her country women. If we
								reflect upon the want of feeling in the frequenters of our theatres,
								their indolence and inattention, and I may add their shameless
								effrontery, we must give the palm to the O-Taheiteans, who. like the
								true children of nature, have a sympathizing tear, and unrestrained
								feelings, the tribute and glory of humanity, in readiness on all
								proper occasions.</p><p n="498"><q><emph>- - - - - - - - Mollissima corda Humano generi dare se

								When the polite arts become the promoters of so great and so

								philosophers must allow them a place among the objects which ought
								to be communicated in a system of useful and moral education. In
								this light therefore, these nations consider these arts; every
								individual delights in the exercise of them, and endeavours to
								acquire excellence in them. The professors of these arts are so far
								from being degraded by them, that even the Princesses of the blood
								Royal think it not derogatory to their rank to exhibit their skill
								in dancing before a crouded audience of their father's or brother's
								subjects; and the actors were some of the Hoas or attendants upon
								the King. We hardly met with a single person, who was not able to
								sing a tune; and on all occasions the women subservient to the
								pleasures of our sailors, were singing their own extempore
								compositions. We had no opportunity of forming a judgment of the
								dances or drama of the other islands in the South Sea; as our stay
								among them was too short, and the knowledge of their respective
								languages too imperfect.</p><p n="500">I cannot leave this subject without mentioning that the
								New-Zeelanders used likewise to exhibit to us their war-song, which
								was begun by one of them, and accompanied with vilent stampings,
								motions, and gestures, and the brandishing of their battle-axes; at
								the end of every stanza of the song, was a kind of burden,10 which
								was sung by the whole band of warriors in chorus, with the loudest
								and most dreadful vociferations; which gradually worked them up to a
								kind of phrenzy, the only state of mind in which they fight. In
								O-Tah... I saw a funeral ceremony performed, wherein dancing was
								exhibited by three small girls, with occasional interludes by three
								men. Between the acts the friends and relations (Hea-bddee)
								appeared dressed, in pairs at the entrance of the house, but came
								not in; and afterwards the whole place, about thirty feet long and
								eight feet wide was spread with cloth, which, was afterwards given
								to the drummers. I could not learn any other particulars relative to
								the meaning or tendency of this ceremony, except that it is not
								uncommon to celebrate the funerals of people of some rank by the
								rounds*<ref target="#jf167"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf167">* Hawkesworth, vol. ii. p. 146.</note></ref> of the chief-mourner, dressed in the HŠva, (described before
								p. 450, &amp;c. &amp;c.) and likewise by a dramatic performance,
								accompanied as customary, by dances and songs.</p><p n="501">The knowledge of sciences, as far as they are cultivated at Taheitee
								and its neighbourhood, lies no doubt, in a very small compass, if
								compared with ours; but it is sufficient to give them a great
								pre-eminence above the inhabitants of the other isles, and
								contributes in some measure to their greater happiness, whether in
								procuring more enjoyment, or in averting those evils which are the
								consequences of ignorance and stupidity. Medicine, History,
								Geography, Astronomy, Navigation, and Divinity, are almost the only
								sciences of which the Taheiteans have some ideas.</p><p n="502">The nations of the South-Sea-Isles generally enjoy a perfect state of
								health, and we saw many of them, who had attained to old age, for we
								observed grey and even white hairs on their heads; and all the
								symptoms and attendants of old age; though I must confess, they
								could by no means determine with any degree of certainty, how many
								years they had lived: for they think it satisfaction enough to live
								long, without minutely keeping an account of their age, by months or
								years. When Capt. Cook came to O-Taheitee in the year 1769, he saw
								Tootaha and calls him a middle aged man;**<ref target="#jf168"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf168">** Hawkesworth, vol. ii. p. 84.</note></ref> he was no doubt the
								younger brother of O-Amo and Happai, who both were grey headed in
								1774, when we came to Taheitee; their mother was still alive, and in
								my opinion between 60 and 70, she had white hair, and was very
								corpulent, and seemed still to retain so much vigour and strength,
								as to render it probably that she might live several years.</p><p n="503">They have no doubt, in these isles diseases, but as far as I am able
								to judge, from what I saw, diseases are less numerous, and less
								common, than in our climates and societies. And many reasons may be
								assigned, which may induce us to believe the inhabitants more happy,
								and less subject to that croud of diseases, infesting our
								communities, and causing generally such a havock among our
								Europeans, as must shock even the feelings of the most-intrepid
								philosopher, or the most indolent beholder; for they are nothing
								less than scenes of death varied in many hundred shapes.</p><p n="504">They all live in a climate which must be esteemed excellent; for if
								you do not use immoderate exercise, and purposely expose yourself to
								the powerful rays of a vertical sun, you always find it sufficiently
								temperate. The mitigating alternate sea and land breezes assuage the
								heat of the climate; and in all parts of the South-Sea which we
								visited, we found the inhabitants careful to keep under shelter
								during night, in order to avoid the cool and moist nocturnal air;
								and we observed in general, that in all other islands beyond
								Taheitee and the Society-isles, the natives had houses better
								calculated to exclude cold and moisture than those open sheds: nay,
								as the rains often came on in squalls, attended with cold winds from
								the cloudy summits of their hills, they are equally solicitous to
								take shelter at the first appearance of them. Their garments made of
								the bark of the paper-mulberry (Morus papyrifera) are at the same
								time a warm and a cool dress; sufficient to screen them against the
								rays of the sun, and likewise to keep off the noxious effects of
								cooling winds.</p><p n="505">The fine tropical fruits, which afford a salubrious palatable and
								nourishing food, contribute likewise to preserve that healthy habit
								of body which the natives generally enjoy, for they are as yet
								strangers to the curse entailed on European societies, that a man
								comes into the world with a body, whose solids are infirm and
								relaxed, whose nerves are tortured by acute pains, whose fluids are
								poisoned with a virus which saps his vital from the very day of his
								birth, and who has this wretchedness settled on him, as it were by
								inheritance. Their gluttonous Chiefs and Arees it is true, stuff
								themselves with immoderate quantities of food, but it causes no
								other inconveniences than to make them fat and unwieldy. The finest
								fishes, and other marine productions, as cray-fish, shells,
								sea-eggs, cuttle-fish, and one kind of blubber, serve them instead
								of food; and though many of the latter are not eaten by us, they
								seem not however, to cause any diseases; especially as the common
								sort of people cannot have them in great abundance. As to animal
								food from hogs, dogs, and fowls, I am certain that their meat is but
								sparingly eaten; however, whenever they kill one of the two first
								animals, the chiefs indulge themselves in devouring the blood, the
								fat, the entrails, and so much of the meat, as few Europeans would
								be capable of eating at one meal; but as these indulgencies are not
								very frequent, and their stomachs prove strong and powerful
								digesters, they are seldom, if ever sick of a surfeit. Their common
								drink is fresh water, and in some few cases even sea-water, neither
								of which will prove hurtful. But the chiefs and principle people in
								these isles, use themselves to drink a liquor prepared by chewing
								the root of a kind of cultivated pepper, (Piper methysticum) which
								they put into a wooden bowl and infuse with common or
								coco-nut-water, and afterwards strain through coco-nut-core; which
								is then whitish, insipid, or partaking somewhat of the taste of a
								weak infusion of pepper.11 This potion when taken in quantities,
								makes them drowsy, stupid, and intoxicated,*<ref target="#jf169"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf169">* It is the general character of all uncivilized nations to be addicted to drunkenness and inebriation caused by various vegetables.

The Mohammedans use opium and smoak tobacco, which last custom among the Khalmyks is practised by women and children. The African Negroes are fond of brandy to excess, Romer's Description of the Coast of Guinea; and the same is observed of the Hottentots by Kolbe.

								consequences, which I will enumerate hereafter. In Taheitee this
								root is scarce and little used; in Huaheine and the other
								Society-isles they have great plantations of it; in the
								Friendly-isles it is still more liked and cultivated, and every
								where is presented as a sign of friendship. However upon the whole,
								but few persons use it; it cannot therefore influence the health of
								the nation at large.</p><p n="506">The frequent use of moderate exercise, in walking from one place to
								another in their shady cool groves, in felling trees, and slowly
								excavating, rasping, and piercing their embarkations, or making
								other utensils, together with the gentle exercise of leisurely
								paddling their canoes, when they go a fishing, contribute greatly to
								their salubrious habit of body. However, as the heat of a vertical
								sun might cause too violent, and too general a relaxation of the
								solids, they prevent this by frequently bathing in sea-water, after
								which, they commonly perform an ablution in fresh water. They
								generally bathe every evening and morning, or at either time
								according as they have used themselves to it. But as an insensible
								and strong perspiration generally weakens our bodies very much in
								hot climates, and by carrying off too many liquids, renders them
								more obnoxious to putrid diseases, the natives of these isles would
								be equally subject to this inconvenience, if they had not a custom,
								which really seems to be intended to obviate the too copious
								perspiration, for at certain times they anoint their hair and head
								and the whole body, with the oil extracted from coco-nuts, and made
								odoriferous by adding the wood, the fruit, the flowers, and the
								leaves of several scented plants.*<ref target="#jf170"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf170">* Fran‡ois Pyrard Voyage, b. i. p. 126, says the same of the people in the Maledive Islands.</note></ref> Upon the whole, their chearful
								temper, the absence of cares, their simplicity of manners, with the
								above enumerated causes, co-operate strongly to prevent the attacks
								of many varied diseases; and as the greater and more sensible part
								of these nations, adhere to an exemplary sobriety in every respect,
								this evidently contributes much to keep them in health, and in the
								enjoyment of real happiness.</p><p n="507">We found in the isles but few people who were disfigured or maimed,
								or had any bodily imperfections: however they were by no means
								entirely free from them. For I saw some that squinted, others that
								had a film over one eye, and several blind of one eye. In the isle
								of Tanna I observed many who had a kind of weakness in the eye-lids,
								so that they could not lift them up beyond a limited extent, but
								were obliged to raise the head in order to see things that were upon
								a level with their eye. I have reason to believe that it is not
								merely an accidental ailment; for I saw a man and his little son of
								about five or six years, both labouring under the same imperfection,
								so that it might perhaps be owing to the manner of living in that
								family, or be caused by the insalubrious spot their hut stood on, or
								perhaps it is peculiar to this, and some other families, and is
								propagated.*<ref target="#jf171"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf171">* There are instances that dumbness and deafness have been propagated from parents upon children; likewise blindness has been entailed upon children; and people who have either four or six fingers on their hands, have procreated children with the same imperfection: in the same manner it is possible, that this defect might be propagated; though I am rather induced to suppose that this paralysis of the eye-lids was caused by the marshy situation of the huts in which the families lived, and from the constant smoak with which their huts are filled during night, in order to free the inhabitants of the numerous mosquitoes swarming in these marshy woods; there are likewise some kinds of wood, whose smoak makes people either entirely blind, or at least nearly deprives them of their eye-sight. See Osbeck's voyage, vol. i.
									p. 320.</note></ref> I observed a few hump-backed, and also here and there a
								crooked person, some had distorted legs, and one man had a leg that
								was entirely withered and dried up. Among the robust New-Zeelanders,
								I saw a man of a fine figure with a lame hand. But as we were,
								especially in the beginning, very little acquainted with their
								language, and had a great deal of other business upon our hands, we
								could not minutely enquire into all the causes and particulars of
								these imperfections. I saw one man at Huaheine, who had a very great
								Hernia umbilicalis, and another in the same place with an immense
								expansion and schirrosity of the right testicle, which was grown to
								the size of a child's head, so that all the scrotum, and even the
								membrane over the penis was entirely filled up with it; and the
								aperture for making water, was driven to one side, and this man was
								nevertheless active, strong, and mounted the sides of our ship, with
								as great agility and unconcern, as if he were not in the least
								affected by this dreadful accident.</p><p n="508">Among the diseases which we had an opportunity of observing in these
								nations, I must first reckon the cough: several laboured under it,
								especially towards night and in the morning; owing, as is probable,
								to their being too long exposed to cold rains or the cool of the
								night on the reef, when they are fishing, or perhaps being too
								slightly covered during night in their own houses.</p><p n="509">Another disease was more common among the natives of these isles,
								which has various degrees and stadia, but in its utmost height and
								inveteracy seems to be a real kind of Leprosy: its slightest degree,
								is a kind of scaly exfoliation of the skin, of a whitish, or often a
								while colour.13 Sometimes the whole body was covered with it,
								sometimes only one leg, sometimes both or the back only were
								affected with it; or perhaps only a few detached blotches on the
								body had this appearance. However we must distinguish from this
								symptom, two other appearances; the one, when we saw the bodies of
								the natives white and covered with a disagreeable roughness; and
								this being new to us, we imagined it might be some disease, but they
								soon undeceived us, by saying it was only sea salt, for the moment
								before they had been swimming in the sea, which we did not know. The
								second phenomenon is caused by the too frequent use of the before
								mentioned inebriating liquor prepared from the pepper-root: in this
								case the skin looks as if it had been parched and dried by heat and
								winds, it has a blackish appearance, and scales are even now and
								then separated from it. The eyes of people who use this liquor too
								freely are commonly red, inflamed, and sore, the body grows
								gradually emaciated, and the inhabitants become stupid, infirm, and
								dwindle away. All these symptoms, as we were told, were the
								consequences of the too immoderate use of the infusion of the
								pepper-root. But the scales of the morbous exfoliation, are not so
								harsh to the touch as those caused by sea-water, and there is
								generally a kind of tumour or swelling under it. In a higher degree
								of the disease I observed some ulcers in the white blotches, which
								appeared as if they were extending under the skin, honey-combed, and
								were running with red orifices surrounded by a red fungous flesh,
								sometimes between the white spots a livid or reddish hue of the part
								affected might be observed.</p><p n="510">In the second kind or species of this terrible disorder, I saw
								several roundish or oblong people elevations on the skin, of the
								size of a crown piece. Some of them looked as if a part had been
								rotten, and fallen out and had turned into an ulcer filled with red
								fungosities. At E-Aoowe, or Middleburgh, in the Friendly-isles, a
								woman was afflicted with this kind, whose face swelled to an extreme
								degree, was one red, livid, and running sore, the nose was entirely
								rotten and had dropped off, the cheeks were of a red spungy
								substance. The eyes sunk deep in the head, red and sore: in a word,
								she was a most pitiable and miserable object.</p><p n="511">I saw still another kind of the same disease, in the same isles of
								E-Aoowe. The back and left shoulder of a man as far as his upper arm
								was covered with a kind of ulcer, which was a quarter of an inch
								higher than the rest of the body. The whole was of a deep livid red,
								and the elevated margins towards the extremities were of a nasty
								yellow colour: it was not a running sore, though it had much the
								appearance of it. The natives have no peculiar name for this or any
								other disorders that cause ulcers, pimples, or eruptions, all are
								promiscuously called e-p...e or sores. I observed at Tah...,
								O-Raiedea, Tonga-Tabbu, and at New-Caledonia men with one or both
								legs enlarged to a monstrous size; the limb was entirely livid and
								felt hard, and the tumour was confined chiefly to the interval
								between the knee and instep, though it extended somewhat up the
								thigh, and even to the toes; however the leg was more swelled in
								proportion than any other part. Notwithstanding this, I observed the
								men could walk stoutly, and did not hesitate to wade through the
								sea-water almost up to their waist, and felt no other inconvenience
								as far as we could observe, than that they had a difficulty of
								breathing. This seems to be a kind of elephantiasis, such as some
								people have in the East Indies on the coast of Malabar.*<ref target="#jf172"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf172">* On sait qu'il y a la maladie appelle‚ pedes strumosi parmi les Indiens qui se disont Chretiens de

								New-Caledonia, I saw two men each having an arm enlarged in the same
								manner.</p><p n="512">When we arrived at O-Taheitee in 1773, we learnt that a Spanish ship
								had been there a few months before us, which the natives called
								PaheŠ no PŠpe or PŠppe's ship. To whose commander they gave the name
								of t'Errire; and by this ship's crew a disease had been introduced
								among them, which they called e-pae-no-pŠppe, PŠppe's disease or
								sore. At the Cape of Good Hope, we heard from Mr. Crozet, Captain of
								a French East-India ship, and from the officers on board the Frigate
								Juno, in the Spanish service, under the command of Don Juan Arraos,
								that in the year 1773, Capt. Don Juan de Langara y Huarte had been
								with two Spanish ships upon discoveries in the South Seas, and had
								touched at Taheitee. The natives represented to us, that the disease
								of o-PŠppe caused ulcers, difficulty of breathing, a falling off of
								the hair, and lastly death; and that it had been communicated by
								co-habitation with women. We suspected this at first to be a
								venereal disease, but upon a further consideration, I am apt to
								believe, that as this Spanish ship came from Lima and Callao, where
								a great number of negro slaves are kept, who are frequently and
								chiefly subject to the various kinds of leprosis and elephantiasis,
								it might perhaps have happened that one or more of the crew might be
								infected with that kind of elephantiasis, which they communicated to
								the natives of these isles: for it is well known, that some species
								of leprosy may be communicated by cohabitation, that many lepers are
								very immoderate in venery, even a few moments before they expire,
								and that especially the elephantiasis described by Aretaeus and
								Paulus Aegineta, had some symptoms that are perfectly corresponding
								with those pointed out by the natives. We could see no person at the
								time of our arrival infected with that distemper, otherwise we
								should have inquired more accurately into its particular symptoms.
								And I do not intend to be positive that the disease was communicated
								to the natives by the people in the Spanish ship; for if an uncommon
								distemper should happen to break out at the time of the arrival, or
								stay of some strangers in a country, the strangers have often been
								accused of having given the infection, though they very little
								deserved such a charge.</p><p n="513">When Captain Cook came in the year 1769, in the Endeavour to
								O-Taheitee, he found that half his crew when he left the
								Society-isles, were infected with the venereal disease,*<ref target="#jf173"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf173">* See Hawkesworth, vol. ii. p. 233.</note></ref> and it was
								then suspected that Mr. Bougainville's ship's crew had communicated
								this disease. Mr. de Bougainville in his turn suspects the English
								in the Dolphin to have first introduced it:=<ref target="#jf174"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf174">= See Bougainville's Voyage. English translation, p. 274, and 286.</note></ref> and the gentlemen in
								the Dolphin assert they never had one man infected with the least
								venereal symptoms whilst they were at Taheitee or immediately
								afterwards.**<ref target="#jf175"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf175">** See Hawkesworth, vol. i p. 489, 490.</note></ref> When we came to Queen Charlotte's Sound, in
								New-Zeeland, in 1773, we had been out at sea for at least five
								months; none of our sailors had any symptom of this disease, which
								could hardly lie dormant for such a length of time; since from our
								leaving the Cape of Good Hope, they had been eating salt-meat and
								salt-pork plentifully, had no greens all that time, had indulged
								freely in the use of spirituous liquors, and were during the whole
								of the intermediate time, exposed to wet and cold, and all the
								rigours of the climate: circumstances that would soon have
								accelerated the breaking out of the distemper, and rendered it so
								virulent, that they must have had recourse to the assistance of the
								surgeon: yet, when we went out of Queen Charlotte's Sound, six
								months after leaving the Cape, a midshipman on board the Adventure
								discovered that he had been infected by one of the New-Zeeland
								females. In O-Taheitee, and the Society-isles, we found in 1773, the
								females communicated this disease to several of our people. From the
								Friendly-isles no infection was either received or communicated,
								because the people who laboured under it were not allowed to have
								any commerce with the females of those isles. The crew left the
								Marquesas and Easter-island without catching, or communicating the
								evil, because not a single person was infected with it, either
								before we visited those parts, or for some time after we had left
								them. At Taheitee and the Society-isles, the infection came in 1774
								again into our ship; and as we staid only a few days at Namocka, I
								believe none either received or communicated it there. In the more
								Western Isles of Mallicollo, Tanna, and New-Caledonia our sailors
								had no connection with the females; but in New-Zeeland the disorder
								was again communicated to our crew. So that there is great reason to
								believe that the venereal disease has not been lately introduced
								into these isles, but was known there for a long time; especially as
								Ohedeeddee or Mahaine, the young man of Borabora, who went with us
								in 1773 from O-Raiedea, told us that this evil was very common in
								Borabora, where however, no European ship had ever touched; nay, he
								informed us that his own mother died of this disease before the
								arrival of Europeans in these isles.14</p><p n="514">It seems to me therefore highly probable, that this infectious evil
								is of such a nature, that by a very libidinous life, and promiscuous
								cohabitation of males with females, it may very easily be caught;
								and we are now certain, that there is hardly a country to be found,
								where the young unmarried females are allowed such a latitude as at
								O-Taheitee and its neighbourhood in admitting a variety of young
								males, and abandoning themselves to various embraces without
								derogating from their character. Women of all ranks follow these
								practices from the earliest time, and after having passed through
								the embraces of hundreds, are married to the first people of the
								isle. It is therefore no wonder, that in a hot climate, in a
								libidinous nation, inclined to the leprosy and its various branches,
								a disease should pullulate, which may become contagious only by
								cohabitation. We had opportunities of observing the most miserable
								objects in the last stage of this horrid evil. At Huaheine
								especially, we saw in 1774, a youth with a cadaverous look and
								complexion, covered with ulcers, especially under the arms, on the
								groin, and about the genitals, and wherever a congeries of glands is
								found in the human body. His eyes were almost extinct, his whole
								frame greatly reduced and emaciated, he dragged after him his
								languid excruciated limbs, the sad victim of brutal appetite and
								libidinous desire.*<ref target="#jf176"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf176">* That the venereal disease is by no means to be considered as an evil imported into Europe from America, has been sufficiently proved by Mr. Sanchez, a very able and learned physician, (who has been for some time in Russia) in two little Treatises intitled: Dissertation sur l'origine de la maladie Venerienne, Paris, 1752, 12mo. Examen Historique sur l'apparition de la maladie Venerienne en Europe, Lisbonne, (Paris) 1774. It appears from his inquiries that the venereal disease appeared so early as in March, 1493, in Italy, and in Auvergne in France; at the very time when Christopher Columbus returned to Spain from America; for he landed at Seville, on the 15th of March, 1493, and in the middle of April in the same year he arrived at court, which then resided at Barcelona. From a book of Peter Pintor, a Spanish physician it appears, that the venereal disease raged at Rome, in March, 1493; and it is likewise to be collected from other writers, that about that time this evil spread all over Italy in the form of an epidemical distemper. Pacificus Maximus, a poet, whose book was printed at Florence, 1489, describes lib. iii. ad priapum, the venereal disease in such a manner, that no doubt can be entertained of its being known at that period of time. In the church of St. Maria del Popolo, at Rome, is a sepulcral monument, erected to the memory of Mario Alberti, qui annum agens xxx. peste inguinaria interiit, Anno. 1485, about eight years before Christopher Columbus returned from his first voyage. (See Viaggiana, or detached Remarks on the Buildings, Pictures, Statues, Inscriptions, &amp;amp;c. &amp;amp;c. of antient and modern Rome, London, 1776.) The Jews who were expelled from Spain, brought the disease into Africa, according to Leo Africanus. Descriptio Africae, lib. i. p. 86. edit. Elzevir. Lugd. Bat. 1632. 16o and it was there for that reason called malum Hispanicum, the Spanish evil. But Mariana, lib. xxxiv. cap.I. ad annum. 1492. says expressly, that the order for the expulsion of the Jews from Spain, was given in March, 1492, and only four months were allowed them, so that they were probably gone in June 1492, before Christopher Columbus sailed for the discovery of America. Nor are there testimonies wanting that in times still more remote, symptoms of the venereal disease were well known: Alfonsus I. King of Naples, died 1458, of the gonorrhoea, or as Tristano Carracciolo de Varietate fortunae, expresses it: morbo insuper immundo &amp;amp; pertinaci, involuntario scilicet insensibilique, spermatis fluxu.15 Ladislas King of Naples, likewise died 1414, of an infection in his genitals; communicated to him by a girl, whom he kept, l'Art de verifier les dates, page 903; and in Cardami Chronicle from 1410-1494. More instances that the venereal disease had been known among the antients, are to be found in Joh. Zach. Platneri Opusculis Tomo ii. Prolusione, ii. de morbo Campano, p. 21. Lipsiae, 1748, 4to Petrus Martyr de Angleria mentions lib. i. epist. 67. dated April the 5th, 1489, that Ario Barbosa, professor at Salamanca, was severely afflicted with the bubas or French disease. Lastly from Muratori's Collectio Scriptorum Historie Italicae, tom. xvi. p. 554, 555 it appears from the Chronicon Placentinum, that in the year 555, after Christ, there was an epidemical pestilential distemper in Italy, which among other symptoms had these peculiar ones, that the glands began to swell to the size of a nut, particularly at the parts which modesty bids to conceal, which swelling was followed by an intolerable heat, and that those, afflicted with that dreadful evil died in a day or two. All these arguments encourage me to suppose, that the venereal disease was not uncommon in antient times; that it however, broke out with new rage about the year 1493, and that fixing and attaching itself upon many other epidemical distempers, it became virulent, by being communicated by cohabiting with women. We need not wonder therefore that the disease should have made its appearance at Taheitee and its neighbourhood, long before the arrival of Europeans at their isle.</note></ref></p><p n="515">Besides the above-mentioned diseases, Towha, then commander of the
								fleet, and one of the chiefs of Atahooroo, had symptoms which every
								body took for the gout; he was of a strong constitution, a corpulent
								habit of body, and owed this disease no doubt to intemperance, which
								is common amongst the great and wealthy of all nations. I observed
								likewise that the natives had frequently a sty in the eye, and some
								symptoms that usually attend the dropsy; and there may be some more
								diseases known among them, which our short stay made it impossible
								for us to discover. This however is certain, that though these
								nations are not without disease, they are upon the whole less
								subject to them than the Europeans, and we must therefore
								acknowledge, that they are in that respect physically happier than
								more civilized nations, who are generally more subject to various
								diseases.</p><p n="516">Though there are among the islanders, especially those in the
								Society-Isles, men whom they call Tahouva-mai,*<ref target="#jf177"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf177">* The Taheiteans call their priests Tahouva; pain, a wound, soreness, or disease, is called by them mai or mamai, from these two words, the word signifying a physician or surgeon, Tahouva-mai is compounded; as if the people meant to intimate that their physicians are in their opinion a kind of priests. And I am inclined to believe that their physicians employ in some instances charms or incantations, prayers or ceremonies against the disease. See Hawkesworth, vol. ii. p. 231, 232.</note></ref> who are a kind of
								physician, yet I could never learn that their knowledge was so
								considerable, that they could cure the abovementioned diseases; for
								generally the natives ingenuously confess, that there is no irrep•u,
								or remedy against them. They have, however, some method of curing
								the venereal disease; because there is an instance of it mentioned
								in Hawkesworth's vol. ii. p. 233, and we were likewise told, that
								they used some irrep•u, or remedy: but either the people to whom we
								spoke, did not know this remedy, and could not therefore inform us
								of it, or they concealed it from us, as a great and important
								secret, not to be trusted with a set of inquisitive strangers. They
								certainly used a kind of Stachys, (EnŠea-rohittee); a Cotula
								(E-V...inoo) with another plant called Eto•hoo bruised as cataplasms
								upon their wounds, though I cannot determine how far those plants
								may be endued with healing qualities. The general sobriety of the
								natives, a sound constitution, and their happy and uniform climate,
								greatly contribute no doubt towards healing their wounds; so that
								the efficacy of their remedies cannot as yet be fairly decided, as a
								set of experiments must be tried in order to ascertain their virtue.
								I am however inclined to believe that they have among themselves
								some traditional knowledge of treating wounds by applying cataplasms
								of bruised plants; this knowledge is perhaps considerably inferior
								to that of the sons of Aesculapius, who, in the Trojan war, assisted
								the wounded Grecian horses with their remedies, and whose science
								was confined, it seems, to a few plaisters and chirurgical
								operations. The scars of wounds which we saw, were not all proofs of
								an equal success in their art. Some were really well healed, and
								others had large elevated seams. However, there were unquestionable
								instances of their skill and success in healing wounds. O-Rettee the
								chief, of O-Hiddea, and the friend of Mr. de Bougainville, had on
								the side of his forehead, an impression on the skull made by a large
								stone, of such a size, that a man's hand might be laid in it; and
								yet there were no visible scars of so dangerous a wound.</p><p n="517">In the friendly isles we observed, that the greater part of the
								nation, had on each cheek-bone a spot, which in some only appeared
								to be of a different colour of the skin, in others we saw these
								round spots covered with a fresh scurf, and again in others they
								were quite red and wounded, as if they had been caused by some
								exulcerating plants, or by burning on it some substance similar to
								the Moxa of the Japanese,*<ref target="#jf178"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf178">* All the Oriental physicians use some cauteries against diseases. The Arabs burn a cylinder of blue cotton cloth on the part affected by pain. The Indians and Malays, use various substances for cauteries applied on diseased parts of the body, the most common of which is the pith of rushes, dipt in Sesam-oil. The Chinese and Japanese use the downy part collected from the young leaves of the common mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris) form a little cone of it, put it on the body and burn it. This remedy has been recommended and used by some Dutch physicians against the gout and rheumatisms, but has hitherto gained but an indifferent reputation. The Laplanders use the common punk or beletus igniarius for the same purpose: Kund Liem's Description of the Laplanders. The Bedwin-Arabs substitute common cotton. D'Arvieux Voyage dans la Palestine; which is likewise found by experiment to be as good as the moxa by Leeuwenhock. See Rob. Hook's Philosophical Experiments and Observations, p. 73. The rest of the authors who have written on the moxa are Valentinus Epistola ad Cleycrum, in the Acta. Nat. Cur. Kaempfer in his Amoenitates Exoticae p. 589. seq. and in the History of Japan, vol. ii. appendix p. 37. Lastly, Petrus Jonas Bergius Materia Medica e regno Vegetabili, p. 673.</note></ref> and the natives intimated to us that it
								was done on account of a cold or pain in the eyes; however we had
								neither time nor opportunity to learn from them in what manner these
								round spots were produced.</p><p n="518">The Tahouva-mai, or physician, is not only versed in the science of
								remedies against the diseases common among these islanders, but he
								has really a knowledge of nature, as far as is compatible with the
								confined ideas of the whole nation. I cannot but imagine that they
								must have some ideas of anatomy, as they are well acquainted with
								all the internal parts of the human body, which they could not have
								learnt but by examining some human corpse; and they have likewise
								peculiar names for all the internal parts of the body: thus for
								instance, they name Roro the brains; o-ho•ttoo the heart; par...‹a
								the liver; ho•a-ho-a the kidneys; opoo-orah...i the stomach; a•u the
								bowels; obo•boo the bladder; pow-oho•re the blind gut; ...wa the
								womb or matrix; and toa-ho-wa the cawl or omentum. Besides they know
								all the plants and animals that are to be found in their isles, or
								in the seas surrounding them, and have peculiar names for
								distinguishing them: nay, they seem to have examined the nature of
								each plant, and animal, since the name often expresses a peculiar
								quality of the plant or animal. Thus for instance, there is at
								Taheitee a kind of Loranthus, which, like all the plants of this
								genus, grows on the branches and stems of other trees, like the
								misletoes and which probably is disseminated and propagated in the
								same manner, the seeds being first eaten by birds, and then voided
								on the branch of a tree, whereon they germinate and grow: this plant
								the natives call toote-oopa, dove's dung, from a kind of dove,
								(oo-o•pa) which is particularly fond of the seeds of this loranthus.
								There is a new species of phyllanthus, whose leaves shut up during
								night, which might not improperly be called the sleeping of the
								plant, and the natives have been shrewd enough to catch this little
								circumstance, and to call the plant from thence, mo‰-mo‰, sleepy:
								Linnaeus has observed this property in many plants, and calls it
								their sleep. The Casuarina equisetifolia affords a very hard and
								ponderous wood, of which the natives make the clubs used in war, and
								as war is called in their language t•a, they have adopted the name
								of e-t•a, for the tree. The seeds of the urena lobata have the same
								quality as the burdock buttons in our country, sticking to peoples
								cloaths; and as the word prree has the signification of glueing or
								joining fast together, they call the plant prree-prree. All these
								circumstances, seem to prove the sagacity and the spirit of
								observation of this people, who have investigated very carefully all
								the plants of their country, and attended to their various
								qualities, which they have preserved in the very name of the plant.
								Nor has their spirit of observation been wanting in distinguishing
								the various parts of plants: thus for instance the roots are called
								Š"; to•moo is the part of the stem within the ground, (caudex intra
								terram) and e-ra-o- is the name for the stem above ground; the
								branches are called ...ma, the leaves elo-, the middle shoot am•u,
								the flower te...rre, the fruit ho•erro. What made me most attentive
								to these trifles are the names or•e for the spatha of the flowers of
								the coco-nut, and that of te-pevaye, signifying the bracteal leaves
								of a plant; which nice distinctions certainly prove a particular
								attention in discriminating these parts from the rest in a plant,
								and that they had in a manner, made botany their particular study;
								in which opinion we often were confirmed, when they pointed out to
								us, the differences in the species of plants; by the variety of
								flowers, the shape of the leaves, &amp;c. &amp;c.*<ref target="#jf179"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf179">* They are likewise acquainted with the sexual system, especially in the coco-palm.</note></ref></p><p n="519">From the above observations we learn, that on account of wounds and
								diseases, mankind was first led to seek after remedies, by the
								examination of plants; and by attending more accurately to the parts
								affected by pain, to enquire into the interior structure of the
								human body. The want of happiness and enjoyment, prompted man to
								exert his industry and talents, in order to find out the means of
								restoring the loss of health and strength. The consciousness of his
								own weakness, rouzed him from his original indolence, and spurred
								him on to the exertion of industry, to the examination and study of
								himself, and the objects surrounding him, and to seek for assistance
								in that very nature, of which he himself constitutes so considerable
								a part.</p><p n="520">The preservation of the memory of transactions and men is not quite
								neglected in Taheitee; for they are able to give a good account of
								the things which happened in their isle; but this can only be said
								of the most recent transactions; for as they take no care to number
								their own years, they likewise are unable to say how long it is
								since an accident happened; all that they can do is to say that such
								a thing happened in my grand-father's, or great grand-father's time.
								The remarkable events, and the names of persons whose memory is
								deemed worth preserving, are recorded in verses of their own making,
								and occasionally sung, which form the rude annals of their history.
								In this respect, the Taheiteans are similar to all other nations,
								who have not the art of writing, or of perpetuating their ideas, the
								deeds of their great men, and the remarkable events which happen
								among them.</p><p n="521">The next branches of science, of which the inhabitants of Taheitee
								and its neighbourhood have some knowledge, are astronomy, geography,
								and navigation. I mention these three sciences purposely together,
								as they are closely connected, and as the knowledge of the two first
								has been made subservient to the last; and I believe likewise, that
								by their navigation they learnt so much of geography as they are
								acquainted with, and perhaps would not have attempted to observe the
								heavens, had it not been for the single purpose of directing them in
								their navigations to remote parts. So that necessity, not mere
								curiosity only, led them to the observation of the heavens. For as
								they are obliged to go now and then to the neighbouring isles, it
								often happens that a storm surprizes them at sea, and drives them
								far from their intended course, and separates them from their home,
								which they never would see again, had they not acquired some
								knowledge of the motion of the heavenly bodies. Those men among
								these islanders, who had acquired some ideas of the heavens, by
								necessity and a long experience, communicated them to the rising
								generation, in order to enable them to profit by their toils, and
								the study of many a night passed without sleep. Finding by cruel
								necessity that in an open sea nothing could guide them, but those
								luminaries which we see in the day, or which give their light to us
								in the night; they attended to the immense number of stars spread
								all over the firmament, some of which they soon discovered to have a
								motion peculiar to themselves, to describe again the same rounds
								which they had compleated before, and to perform their revolutions
								in different and stated periods of time, while the rest preserved
								invariably the same distance from one another.</p><p n="522">The sky in this country is commonly clear and serene, and on a few
								days only in the whole year, is covered with clouds; so that the
								natives of the tropical isles have frequent opportunities of
								contemplating the heavens, and admiring during night the brilliancy
								of the stars. After the darkness of the night is over, they do not
								enjoy so long a twilight as we do; but the sun darts out at once as
								it were in full splendor from under the horizon, and shines with
								uncommon brightness and power, till he again sets on the opposite
								part of the horizon, when in a few minutes night spreads her sable
								hues over all the objects surrounding the happy natives of these
								isles. It must have been obvious to each beholder, that the sun
								rises and sets at certain times in points of the horizon
								diametrically opposite to one another, and at others, in points not
								much deviating from those situated either on one or the other side
								of them, for the whole difference cannot exceed fifty degrees. These
								regions of the horizon, are equally remarkable for the rising and
								setting of the moon nearly within the same space, and soon after
								they must likewise have found that five stars, (the greater part of
								which equalled or surpassed even the largest stars in apparent
								magnitude) rose and set within the same space of the horizon. This
								was sufficient to induce them to call that part of the heavens by a
								peculiar name. The place where the sun rises they called Tataheta,
								and the place where he sets Topa-t-er.... They likewise found, that
								the sun from the time of rising came nearer and nearer to the
								zenith, that he removed farther and farther from that point till his
								setting, and that at certain times he was perpendicular over their
								heads; the line whereon the sun comes nearest to their zenith and
								upon it or the meridian, they call T-er...-whattŠa. The Northern
								point of this imaginary line on the horizon, they name Too-ero-, and
								the opposite point To.... They have likewise names for several
								points between these cardinal ones, which I heard mentioned, but I
								was not able exactly to determine either the number or the direction
								of them. If I am not mistaken, the whole horizon is divided into
								twelve points, so that two points would fall between two
								cardinals.</p><p n="523">The natives of these isles could not help observing, that the bread
								fruit, their chief subsistence, grows but once during twelve months
								or revolutions of the moon; for during the space of seven months
								this fruit is gathered in abundance on the trees that bear it, but
								during five months they find none. This circumstance very naturally
								must lead them to investigate the true cause of it, the revolution
								of the sun. At the solstice in December, the sun is in its meridian
								altitude beyond the isle, towards the South of it, and in the
								solstice in June, he is in the Northern Hemisphere, and therefore
								passes twice a year through the zenith. About two months before and
								after the time of the suns reaching the Southern tropic, bread-fruit
								is very scarce, and during the season from August to March, this
								fruit is very plentiful, being ripe in March or the beginning of
								April, and this last season they call Pa-o•roo, from the name of
								bread-fruit. The mildness of the climate however is such, that there
								is always a tree here and there, which from its peculiar situation
								in a valley more elevated than the plain surrounding the isle, or
								from its exposure on the Southern side of a high hill, bears fruit
								at a time when the generality of trees of this kind have none; and
								it is from these trees that their chiefs and better sort of people
								have a constant succession of fresh bread-fruit, at a time when the
								rest of the people are obliged to live upon horse-plantanes, the
								fruit of the Ratta-tree, (Inocarpus edulis) the roots of eddoes, or
								the Arum esculentum and macrorhizon, and those of yams or Dioscorea
								alata and oppositifolia; or they then chiefly use the MahŠe or
								sour-paste prepared from fermented ripe bread-fruit.*<ref target="#jf180"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf180">* The description of the operations necessary for this purpose, is given in Hawkesworth, vol. ii. p. 198, 199.</note></ref></p><p n="524">The whole of the bread-fruit season, including the time when they
								have none, is called T...oo, and is therefore answerable to a year.
								They count the revolutions of the moon, and call them by the same
								name as the moon Marama or Malama. They enumerated to me thirteen
								names of moons or lunations, and then said H...re-te-t...oo, the
								year is gone; and added still Oom...nnoo, often, often, many times;
								which seemed to imply, that the cycle of the lunations is to be
								repeated every year. They begin the year about March, when they
								likewise begin to make their bread-fruit sour-paste or MahŠe, for
								which purpose immense quantities of the fruit are plucked off, which
								naturally creates some scarcity of this their chief aliment and must
								increase the same in proportion as the season advances. I cannot,
								from the mere enumeration of the thirteen names of months, prevail
								on myself to think that their year has thirteen lunations, but
								rather suppose that they have but twelve lunations, and now and then
								intercalate a thirteenth month, in order to keep the solar and lunar
								year in harmony; how often they do this, I pretend not to say. The
								names of the months are subjoined for the satisfaction of my
								readers.</p><p n="525"><q><emph> 1.

The fourth month Oohee-eya has certainly a reference to angling for fish. The eighth month O-Te-...ree, is thus called from the young coco-nuts, which probably are then most plentiful. The ninth month O-Te-ta, alludes to the sea. The eleventh Wae-...hou, to their cloth, and the twelfth Piprree, to some covetousness or scantiness, perhaps in food.

								days, which approaches nearly to the real length of a lunation. If
								their year has but twelve months, it contains only 348 days; but if
								the thirteenth be added, it consists of 377 days; in the first case,
								the year is 17 days too short, and in the second, it exceeds the
								solar year by twelve days. This circumstance leads me to suspect,
								that they have some method of harmonizing the solar and lunar year
								unknown to us. What is more remarkable, I found that every one of
								the 29 days of the month has a peculiar name, which they have in
								common with the Persians, who appropriate to each day of the month a
								particular name. Their month begins from the first appearance of the
								new moon, and after the 28th and 29th day of the month, they added
								that the moon was dead, m...rama-m...tte, which proves that their
								months by no means consist exactly of 29 days; but that they contain
								sometimes 30, and sometimes 29 days only, according as the new moon
								makes her appearance sooner or later: for if they reckon exactly 29
								days for a month, they would soon fall short of the new-moon, and
								then it could not be with propriety said of the two last days of the
								month, m...rama-m...tte, the moon is dead; by which expression they

								of ours, have peculiar names, and are in length similar to the hours

								of the compass during night. Tupaia was so well skilled in this,
								that wherever they came with the ship during the navigation of
								nearly a year, previous to the arrival of the Endeavour at Batavia,
								he could always point out the direction in which Taheitee was

								necessary to distinguish each of them by a peculiar name. The sun

The seven stars are called E-whettoo-owha..., or the stars of the nest; probably the natives abstracted from the position of the stars, the figure of a bird's nest. The Dog-star Ta-whettoo ro... is the great star, and this name is very properly given. The milky way or T'Šiya seems to signify a sail. A comet or E-whettoo-wŠrra signifies the burning star.</note></ref> Sirius or the
								Dog-star Ta-whettoo-r•a; the stars forming the belt of Orion are
								named E-whettoo-mah¢o, the milky way is known by the denomination of
								T-Šiya, and a comet or blazing star by that of E-whettoo-wŠrra; the
								natives have also a name for a shooting star and call it Ep...o, and
								think that it is an evil genius passing rapidly through the heavens.
								They are doubtless acquainted with other stars, than those here
								enumerated, and by their rising or setting are enabled to judge of
								the time of the night, and likewise of the points of the heavens
								though they have no compass. It is very well known that their
								imperfect astronomical knowledge is only applicable to the parts of
								the world which are near to O-Taheitee, as the appearances would be
								greatly altered at a moderate distance from their isle, and be of no
								further use to them. We found however upon examination, that this
								moderate share of astronomy and the slightness of their embarkations
								did not hinder them from acquiring a very extensive knowledge of the
								islands in the neighbourhood. Tupaya the most intelligent man that
								ever was met with by any European navigator in these isles, had
								himself been ten or twelve days sail to the Westward of O-Raiedea;
								which according to Capt. Cook's computation,**<ref target="#jf184"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf184">** Hawkesworth, vol. ii. p. 278.</note></ref> would make 400
								leagues, or about twenty degrees of longitude. This man when on
								board the Endeavour, gave an account of his navigations and
								mentioned the names of more than eighty isles which he knew,</p><p n="531">CHART</p><p n="532">together with their size and situation, the greater part of which he
								had visited, and having soon perceived the meaning and use of
								charts, he gave directions for making one according to his account,
								and always pointed to the part of the heavens, where each isle was
								situated, mentioning at the same time that it was either larger or
								smaller than Taheitee, and likewise whether it was high or low,
								whether it was peopled or not, adding now and then some curious
								accounts relative to some of them.16 Of this chart a copy was
								obligingly communicated to me by Mr. Pickersgill, Lieutenant on
								board the Resolution, and who had been before twice at Taheitee, in
								the Endeavour, and in the Dolphin. Captain Cook was pleased also to
								communicate to me, two catalogues of such isles as he had heard
								named in his first voyage at Taheitee, and from Tupaya; I met with
								another copy of the chart, drawn after Tupaya's direction, in the
								possession of Joseph Banks, Esq. who, with great politeness and well
								known readiness to promote whatever has a tendency to become
								subservient to science, permitted me to take a copy of it. I
								remarked that the charts both agreed in general, and that the
								catalogues contained all the names which were found on the charts,
								and some few more, not inserted in them. I collected likewise many
								names and accounts of islands, when we were at Taheitee and the
								Society Isles. Some of the names were strangely spelt, as there
								never were two persons, in the last and former voyages, who spelt
								the same name in the same manner; it must therefore happen, that
								some of the names seemed to be different; though upon a more
								critical examination, I found them to agree better than might at
								first sight have been expected: this chart I have caused to be
								engraved as a monument of the ingenuity and geographical knowledge
								of the people in the Society Isles, and of Tupaya in particular: the
								isles are all numbered, that I might have an opportunity of
								referring to these numbers, and to add a few remarks, which may be
								thought necessary for illustration. The names themselves are spelt
								as I found them either in one of the catalogues, or the charts, or
								in my own register of observations, a preference being given to the
								best authority, and to the analogy of the language spoken in these
								isles. The chart includes about 20 degrees of longitude on either
								side of the meridian of 150 degrees West from Greenwich, or 40
								degrees in all, and about 20 degrees of South latitude from about 7
								degrees to 27 degrees; the parallel of 17 degrees running in the
								middle. It cannot be expected that this chart should be of such
								accuracy as to enable future navigators to make use of it: it is
								chiefly intended to give some idea of the geography of the
								inhabitants of the isles in the South Sea, and it will likewise
								serve to make every navigator cautious when he arrives at that part
								of the ocean comprehended in this chart; and probably may be the
								means of ascertaining the situation of these numerous and partly
								undiscovered isles.</p><p n="533">1. O-Tah¶itee, called by Capt. Wallis King George's Island, and by

								that Mr. Dalrymple's conjecture has not been invalidated by the shew
								of arguments opposed to it. It is about thirty leagues in
								circumference, and both Peninsulas are high land, which, especially
								in the Easternmost is extremely spiry, and has the strongest marks
								of being the work of a violent earthquake and subterraneous
								fire.</p><p n="534">2. Maeat¶a, was called Osnabruck Island by Captain Wallis, and Pic de
								la Boudeuse or Boudoir by Mr. de Bougainville. If the conjecture of
								Taheitee being Sagittaria is right, Maeatea must be Dezena, seen by
								Quiros February the 9th, 1606. It is about four or five miles in
								circuit, is high land, and the summit of the hill has the appearance
								of being excavated, as if formerly there had been a volcano, whose
								crater is now filled up.</p><p n="535">3. O-Heeva-no1/2e, an isle to the Eastward of O-Taheitee, seems to be
								the same which Captain Cook called Chain Island in 1769, being a
								chain of low islands connected by reefs into an oval shape, about
								five leagues in length.</p><p n="536">4. Oir1/2tah, is an island larger than Taheitee, inhabited.</p><p n="537">5. Ourop1/2µ, likewise inhabited, and larger than Taheitee.</p><p n="538">6. O-Hitte-tamaro-e¹ree, seems to be Osnabruck Island, seen by
								Captain Carteret in the year 1767, is low land, and probably not
								inhabited.</p><p n="539">7. Te-newhamm¶a-t²ne, a low island.</p><p n="540">8. To1/2meto-ro²ro, seems to be the cluster of low islands, seen
								likewise by Captain Carteret, and called by him the Duke of
								Gloucester's Islands.</p><p n="541">9. MoutoÁ, is larger than Taheitee and the Southernmost island, which
								Tupaya had seen; though his father had told him there were islands
								to the Southward of it.</p><p n="542">10. MannÁa is a high island, peopled by ferocious inhabitants, with
								wild and furious looks, and eating men, but having very little
								shipping: its situation is to the North East of O-Hitte-roa.</p><p n="543">11. E¹to-no1/2e.</p><p n="544">12. O-Hitte-r1/2a a high island, seen by Captain Cook in 1769.</p><p n="545">13. Tabbu-a-m²nnoo, a small high island to the West of O-Taheitee,
								seen by Captain Wallis, and called Sir Charles Saunders's Island.
								Mr. de Bougainville heard of it, and calls it Tapoua massou. It is
								about six miles long. The Chief of this island in 1774, was called
								oopa.</p><p n="546">14. E¹meo is high land, and was called York Island by Captain Wallis
								in 1767. Mr. de Bougainville named it Aimeo: It belongs to
								Taheitee.</p><p n="547">15. Huah¶ine is a high island, seen first by Captain Cook, its Chief
								in 1774 was Oree.</p><p n="548">16. Ea-watt¶a, in the middle of the chart, is the name of the
								Meridian-Line.</p><p n="549">17. O-Raiet¶a is a high island, seen first by Captain Cook; Mr. de
								Bougainville had heard of it, and calls it Aiatea. It was conquered
								by OpÁnee chief or king of Borab•ra, and the conquered chief is
								called Oo-o•roo: Tupaya said that in his grandfather's time a
								friendly ship had been there, of which we have no account in Europe,
								unless one of the ships of Roggewein came near this island.</p><p n="550">18. O-Tah² is a high island, seen first by Captain Cook, and likewise
								conquered by OpÁnee, the joint chiefs of it were Ot² and B1/2ba, Mr.
								de Bougainville seems to have heard of it, and called it Otaa.</p><p n="551">19. Borab1/2ra or Bolab1/2la is a high island, governed by OpÁnee.
								Captain Cook saw it first, and it seems Mr. de Bougainville had
								heard something of it and called it Papara.</p><p n="552">20. Toop²i is a low island, uninhabited, resorted to by the
								inhabitants of Borab•ra for the purposes of fishing and fowling:
								sometimes the inhabitants of an island called Pap..." frequent
								it.</p><p n="553">21. Mouro1/2a is a high island, under the dominion of OpÁnee, first
								seen by Captain Cook. Mr. de Bougainville probably heard of it, and
								names it Toomaraa.</p><p n="554">22. O-²nna is a low island, on which a ship was wrecked, and some men
								perished, according to Tupaya's account: it seems to be the same
								which Admiral Byron called Prince of Wales's Island; for though some
								iron and brass, with the head of a rudder of a Dutch longboat, were
								found at King George's Island, it could not be the island on which
								the ship was lost; for the description and situation prove King
								George's Island to be (26) TeokŠa; and the parts of the ship found
								there, might have been carried from O-...nna. The ship lost here,
								may, with great possibility, be supposed to be the African Galley,
								one of Roggewein's squadron, which was wrecked upon an island,
								called, for that reason, Pernicious Island.</p><p n="555">23. O-Mat¶iva, or O-Mat¶a is a low island to the North East of
								RaietŠa, and to the North West of Taheitee: a boat with three men
								and a woman, arrived from thence, some months before us, at
								Huaheine, where I saw the boat, similar to those at TeokŠa, and the
								men were tattowed all over their faces and arms.</p><p n="556">24. O-Wah¶i seems to answer to Waterland, first seen by Schouten and
								Le Maire, in 1616. It is low land.</p><p n="557">25. Oura, and</p><p n="558">26. Teoheow or Teok¶a, two low islands, at a few miles distance from
								one another, were seen by Admiral Byron, in 1765, and called
								George's Islands; we landed, in 1774, on the latter island, and
								learnt the true name of this island from the natives, who called it
								TeoukŠa or TeokŠa. On this island Mr. Byron found the carved head of
								a rudder, probably belonging to a Dutch long-boat, a piece of
								hammered iron, a piece of brass, and some small iron tools. He seems
								to indicate, "that in case the ship to which the long-boat belonged,
								sailed from this place in safety, it would not be easy to account
								for her leaving the rudder of her long-boat behind; and if she was
								cut off by the natives, there must be much more considerable remains
								of her in the island, especially of her iron work, upon which all
								Indian nations, who have no metal, set the highest value." These
								arguments seem to be very just, for the ship was lost on (22)
								O-...nna, the island before mentioned, and these trifles of iron and
								brass, were obtained by the inhabitants of TeokŠa, either by trading
								with those at O-...nna, or as presents to the chiefs: for this is
								very customary in all these islands; thus for instance Op-nee chief
								of Borab•ra, obtained one of Mr. de Bougainville's lost anchors, as
								a present from Tootaha, the chief of Taheitee.</p><p n="559">27. O-Rai-r1/2a seems to be the island of Carlshof discovered in 1722
								by Roggewein.</p><p n="560">28. O-T²h corresponds in some measure with the situation of
								Adventure's Island seen by us in 1773.</p><p n="561">29. O-Pat²i or Oo-pati, answers to the situation of the group of
								islands called by Captain Cook Palliser's Islands, in 1774.</p><p n="562">30. O-Whar¶va is probably the Isle of Furneaux, called thus by us in
								1773.</p><p n="563">31. O-Wh²o, must in all probability be the Island of Birds,
								discovered by Captain Cook in 1769.</p><p n="564">32. O-Rima-r1/2a coincides nearly with the situation of the Isles of
								Disappointment, seen by Admiral Byron in 1765.</p><p n="565">33. O-H¶eva-toutou-²i, to this island Tupaya added the following
								remark, "that the inhabitants are men-eaters, that their ships are
								large, and that the ship from Britain (the Endeavour) was but little
								in comparison."</p><p n="566">34. Hanean¶a is a small island.</p><p n="567">35. Neeo-h¶eva is likewise small.18</p><p n="568">36. Whatt¶rre-to², seems to be la Magdalena discovered by Menda¤a,
								1595.</p><p n="569">37. Terowh².</p><p n="570">38. Teebooai is from its situation very probably Hood's Island one of
								the Marquesas.</p><p n="571">39. What²rre-o1/2ra. In Mr. Bank's chart I find the name written
								WhattŠrre-ero, and in two other lists the last word was spelt oora
								for ero, so that I think it is plain from the nature of the language
								that What...rre-o•ra is the true writing of the name. The name
								Wait...hoo given to the isle of Christina by the natives themselves,
								confirms this still more, for we found that the inhabitants of the
								Marquesas never or at least very seldom pronounced the r; this was
								evident to me from a vocabulary of about eighty words not containing
								a single word with an r, and from the circumstance that all the
								words in the Taheitee language corresponded with the words of the
								language of Wait...hoo, with this difference only that the canine
								letter was either omitted or softened. In O-Taheitee the phrase come
								hither is expressed by harre-m...i, in Wait...hoo by hanna-m...i;
								the hand is called reŠma, and in the Marquesas heŠma; two is
								expressed aro•a at Taheitee, and bo-ho•a at Wait...hoo; three is
								at•roo, and bo-d•-oo at the latter place; five is called reŠma, but
								at Wait...hoo heŠma; great is r•a, and at the Marquesas •a. The
								island of Dominica was called Oheeva-•a instead of Oheeva-r¢a; and
								Wait...hoo in all probability is used in lieu of Watt...rre-o•ra;
								for by dropping the r's there remain Wateae-o•a or Watt...-ooa, in
								which an h has been inserted to compensate the elision of so many
								r's, and pronounced Watt...-hooa or Wait...-hoo. This is certainly
								the island of St. Christina, one of the Marquesas, discovered by
								Menda¤a, 1595, and is high land.</p><p n="572">40. Te-M²nno.</p><p n="573">41. O-1/2tto.</p><p n="574">42. O-H¶eva-r1/2a, is high land, called by the natives O-Heeva-•a,
								and is the same which Menda¤a called Dominica; seems to be populous,
								fertile, and the largest of the Marquesas.</p><p n="575">43. O-He¶va-p1/2tto.</p><p n="576">44. Mope¶ha or Motu-h¶a, is a low island, but large, not inhabited,
								abounding however with fish, coconuts, turtle and pearls.</p><p n="577">45. Whennua-o1/2ra is a low island, has inhabitants, and has the same
								productions with the former.</p><p n="578">46. O-Papat¶a.</p><p n="579">47. Woure¶o is a large island, and inhabited.</p><p n="580">48. UrurutÁ, inhabited.</p><p n="581">49. O-Ade¶ha is an island to which men resort occasionally for
								fishing, but do not live continually on it.</p><p n="582">50. O-Ahoua-h1/2u, large, and peopled.</p><p n="583">51. O-We¶ha.</p><p n="584">52. O-Rima-t²rra, high land and inhabited.</p><p n="585">53. O-Rai-hav²i.</p><p n="586">54. O-Raro-t1/2a has inhabitants.</p><p n="587">55. O-Ahour1/2u larger than Taheitee.</p><p n="588">56. O-Toomoo-p²pa.</p><p n="589">57. Toute¶pa, a low island of no great extent, but is however
								inhabited.</p><p n="590">58. O-Reeva-v²i; Tupaya added this remark, "fine hatchets come from
								thence to Raiedea;" whether these are iron or good stone hatchets
								cannot be determined from this account. If they had iron hatchets,
								they must have been there ever since the time of Abel Jansen Tasman,
								who was in this neighbourhood in 1643, or since the times of
								Schouten and le Maire, 1616. I obtained at E-Aoowe a small nail
								sticking in a kind of handle, which at least proves, how carefully
								the smallest pieces of iron are preserved by these people.</p><p n="591">59. TainÁna.</p><p n="592">60. O-Rima-t¶ma, from its position it seems to be the low island seen
								by us in the year 1774, and called Palmerston's Island.</p><p n="593">61. O-Roto1/2ma is said to be larger than Taheitee.</p><p n="594">62. O-Popp1/2a.</p><p n="595">63. Moµ-no-t²yo is a low island, and from its situation seems to be
								that which we called Hervey's Island in 1773.</p><p n="596">64. Te-to1/2pa-tÁpa-eahoÁ.</p><p n="597">65. O-Hitte-p1/2tto corresponds with the situation of Savage Island
								seen by us in 1774.</p><p n="598">66. O-Hitte-toutou-atÁ.</p><p n="599">67. O-Hitte-toutou-n¶e.</p><p n="600">68. O-Hitte-toutou-r¶ra.</p><p n="601">69. O-Hitte-tait¶rre.</p><p n="602">70.

Wouw1/2u a small low island, but inhabited.</p><p n="608">76. Oop1/2rroo, a large island and well peopled.</p><p n="609">77. Te-errepoo-opo-matte-h¶a.</p><p n="610">78. O-Heav²i is larger than Taheitee; Tupaya added "it is the father
								of all the islands."19</p><p n="611">79. Tedhu-r1/2a, a small island, a few leagues to the North of
								O-Taheitee, has no other inhabitants than those who occasionally
								resort to it from Taheitee.</p><p n="612">80. O-W²nna, one of the low islands, East of Taheitee.</p><p n="613">81. Tata-hap²i, 82. Tapy-ary, 83. Haedede, are three other names of
								islands, which I found mentioned in one of the lists, without any
								thing relative to their situation.</p><p n="614">84. Papp²a is a low island, somewhat to the East of Toop...i (20),
								whose inhabitants frequently go to this last mentioned island in
								order to fish and to catch turtle, but their language is not
								understood by the people of Borabora, who resort there for the same
								purpose.</p><p n="615">As I have no account of the particular situation of the five last
								isles, I omitted the names on the chart. However the number of more
								than eighty isles, is abundantly sufficient to prove that the
								inhabitants of the Society-isles have a competent and extensive
								knowledge of the geography of their neighbourhood, considering the
								small size and slight structure of their embarkations, and the want
								of a compass; and that they cannot like the antient Phoenicians and
								the Greeks, follow the shores of an extensive continent, in order to
								make discoveries, but are obliged to cross large tracts of the ocean
								before they arrive at another island; and what is more remarkable,
								having no other provisions for these long navigations, than their
								sour paste, and some fruit, which cannot be kept above a few days in
								an eatable state; nor have they any vessels large enough to keep
								fresh water in for a long time; and yet with all these
								inconveniences, they have discovered lands at more than 400 leagues
								distance round their islands.</p><p n="616">The Friendly-isles are a group where of Tonga-Tabbu, E-Aoowe, and
								Namocka are the largest; but we saw afterwards many small ones, and
								heard a still greater number named. The small islands off the North
								East point of Tonga-Tabbu, were called Weweghee. When we were
								sailing to Namocka, in 1774, we saw to the East of it some islands,
								whereof one was called O-M²ngo-no1/2e and the other O-M²ngo-e¶tee,
								i.e. great and little Mango; they lay both to the North of our
								track; to the South of it we observed the isles of Tonoo-m¶a and
								Terefetch¶a. South of Namocka-n•oe was Nam1/2cka e¶tee, which last,
								Tasman called Namocaki, on his drawing. To the North West of
								Namocka, are two high isles, the Westernmost is called Tofo1/2a,
								contains a Volcano, and is designed by Tasman, under the name
								Amattafoa, which spelling Captain Cook has adopted in his chart; the
								Easternmost of these isles is called by the natives Ogh²o, but by
								Tasman Kaybay. The Westernmost of the cluster of low isles, situated
								to the North and North East of Namocka, is called Motto-w². The
								other little keys of this archipelago, were called O-Toogho1/2a,
								O-O1/2a, Looghel²-ei, Fonnoo-²cka, Lagholl², Oof²nga, and
								Wofo1/2gee: these were all situated to the North of Namocka, but
								farther to the North East, the natives told us were the islands of
								Oov¶ea, Wo-alee-²va, Oleef²nga, Ko-f1/2o, Ko-e-e-1/2nna,
								Ko-Naghoon²moo, O-Fool²ngo, Mou-e-e-1/2nne, Togho1/2roo,
								Koe-No1/2goo, Ko-1/2gee, Ko-Ne¶moo, and Tonoo-noo-ofo"a.</p><p n="617">Another account of some islands, lying still further to the West, is
								given by Quiros, as it was communicated to him by a native of the
								isle of Chicayana,*<ref target="#jf185"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf185">* See Dalrymple's Collection of Voyages, vol. I. page 151.</note></ref> and as deduced from his own observation and
								discoveries.</p><p n="618">1. Taum²co. Quiros saw in 1°. South latitude, 1250 leagues from
								Mexico, an island, eight or nine leagues in circumference, which was
								high and black, like a volcano, and its name he found to be
								Taum...co.</p><p n="619">2. Chicay²na. Four days sail from thence, is a low island, larger
								than Taum²co, and in the language of the country, dogs are named
								Te-c-ri, or Te-gho•ree, in the same manner as they call them at
								Tonga-Tabbu, and New-Zeeland, which may be construed into an
								argument for the identity of the language.</p><p n="620">3. Guayt1/2po, is another island larger than the two
								before-mentioned, at three days sail from Taumaco and two from
								Chicayana; the inhabitants of these three isles are friendly
								people.</p><p n="621">4. Mecayr²yla is in all probability a low island, and inhabited, to
								which the natives of Guaytopo sail, in search of tortoise-shell, of
								which they make their ear-rings.</p><p n="622">5. Tuc1/2pia is a high island in twelve Degrees South Latitude, five
								days sail South West from Taumaco.</p><p n="623">6. Fonof1/2no is the name of a cluster of small flat isles, three
								days sail from Taumaco, though the voyage may be performed in two
								days with a fresh wind; the inhabitants are said to be very tall.
								The language differs from that spoken at Taumaco.</p><p n="624">7. Pºlen and NÁpan are isles near the Fonofono isles.20</p><p n="625">9. Pouro is a large country very populous; its inhabitants are of a
								dun colour, at war among themselves, and have silver-headed
								arrows.</p><p n="626">There are accounts in Herrera, Galvano, Argensola, and De Couto of
								some islands discovered by Alvarado and Grijalva, which seem to be
								connected with the new Caroline Islands to the South in about 205
								degrees West longitude from Greenwich, near the line: the names of
								these isles are given in Mr. Dalrymple's Collection of Voyages, vol.
								i. p. 35, 36, 37, 38, and 39; but as they were not mentioned by the
								natives, I have forborn to speak of them as proofs of the
								Geographical knowledge of the natives of these parts.</p><p n="627">The foregoing account of the many islands mentioned by Tupaya is
								sufficient to prove that the inhabitants of the islands in the South
								Sea have made very considerable navigations in their slight and weak
								canoes; navigations which many Europeans would think impossible to
								be performed, upon a careful view of the vessels themselves, their
								rigging, sails, &amp;c. &amp;c. also the provisions of the
								climate.</p><p n="628">The arts of dancing, music, and poetry, are generally understood by
								almost every individual from the highest to the lowest rank, but the
								sciences of physic and its various branches, those of geography,
								navigation, and astronomy, are known only to few. This ignorance
								extends so far that the greater part of the nation cannot count
								beyond ten: but those who have been instructed by their teachers can
								reckon as far as 200. I could not learn whether they can count
								beyond that number, but am rather inclined to believe they cannot.
								Their way of reckoning is by enumerating first the digits, 1
								a-tah...i, 2 a-ro•a, 3 a-t•roo, 4 a-hŠa, 5 a-rŠema, 6 a-h•no, 7
								ahddoo, 8 a-w...rroo, 9 a-hŠeva, 10 a-h•oroo; then they add a
								second ten as far as twenty, in the following manner: 11 ma-tah...i,
								12 ma-r•oa, 13 ma-t•roo, 14 ma-hŠa, 15 ma-reŠma, 16 ma-h•no, 17
								ma-hddoo, 18 ma-w...rroo, 19 ma-heŠva, 20 a-tah...i-t...oo. From
								thence they count by scores to 200; viz. they say for 21
								a-tah...i-t...oo-m...ra-tahai, literally one twenty with one; 30 is
								called t...hai-t...oo-m...ra-ho•roo, 40 a-ro•a-t...oo, 50
								a-r•oa-t...oo-m...ra-ho•roo, &amp;c. &amp;c. The teachers are men,
								who have either from their fathers or other teachers acquired a
								knowledge, which, they again impart to others. These people are
								called T...hata-orrŠro, are very much respected, and commonly belong
								to the tribe of chiefs; which circumstance induces me to believe,
								that from their easy and independent circumstances, they are not
								under the necessity of communicating their knowledge to their pupils
								for any retribution; as there is little probability that a chief
								should accept of a reward, or even honorary compensation, having
								himself a competency, viz. land, a house, fruits, and trees that
								bear them; hogs, dogs, and fowls, and lastly toutous to serve
								him.</p><p n="629">The bulk of their science is the work of memory only, and by no means
								the result of meditation, reflection, or reasoning. For I met with
								some of their chiefs who had attempted to learn the names of the
								months and days, but knew them only imperfectly, having taken no
								pains to preserve their knowledge; but those professed teachers,
								(Tahata-orrero) were more perfect. However there must have been a
								time when this knowledge was first introduced among them, and that
								man who was its author must have had patience to attend with
								unwearied application to the study of the heavens, and the motion of
								the heavenly bodies, and been endued with sagacity to discover the
								true length of the solar or bread-fruit year, and the duration of
								lunations, together with the beginning of the new moon. The
								direction in which the remote islands are situated, which they know
								is a business of the greatest difficulty, and required a remarkable
								skill, reflection, and combination of several incidental points;
								which evidently shews that this man had very strong natural parts,
								and had used himself to apply them to the various occurrences of his
								life, and the objects surrounding him. It might perhaps be urged,
								that this knowledge had been most probably carried along with them
								from Asia and the more civilized nations of that continent. Though
								this perhaps might be allowed in regard to other sciences, yet their
								knowledge of astronomy and geography, or their skill in determining
								with nicety the true situation of isles at the distance of 400
								leagues from their own country, and directing the course of their
								boats by the sun and stars,*<ref target="#jf186"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf186">* The Endeavour, in which ship Tupaya sailed to Batavia, sailed first from Taheitee into forty Degrees South Latitude, then she came by a North West course into twenty-eight Degrees, after this she came by a South West course to about thirty-eight Degrees, and by a Western run to New Zeeland, which islands were circumnavigated in runs of various directions to forty-eight Degrees South Latitude, till by another Westerly course the coasts of New Holland were reached, along which she sailed North and North West, up to about four Degrees North Latitude, and then West to Savu, and lastly by the Streights of Sunda to Batavia. However, Tupaya was never at a loss to point to Taheitee, at whatever place he came, even at Batavia at more than 2000 Leagues distance: which evidently proves that he was perfectly well acquainted with astronomy and geography, as far as they are necessary for these purposes.22</note></ref> proves evidently that this science must
								have had its rise and progress among themselves; as many points
								could by no means agree, had the Asiatic astronomy discovered in the
								Northern Hemisphere been carried to Taheitee. The points where the
								sun rises and sets at different seasons, in countries situated in
								the Southern hemisphere, differs from those in the Northern, so that
								the Asiatic knowledge must have been in a great measure useless. The
								farther the Asiatic country, in which we will suppose the Taheitean
								astronomy to have originated, is removed from the equinoctial line
								Northwards, the more sensible does this difference become, and
								renders it more probable that the inhabitants of these isles were
								the inventors of their own astronomy and geography: and if they had
								strength of mind sufficient to enable them to invent sciences which
								require accurate observations, and a remarkably strong sagacity; why
								may we not think them equally capable of being the inventors of the
								whole cyclus of their knowledge.</p><p n="630"><q><emph>Macti ingenio este caeli interpretes, rerumque naturae

								our minds with awe and respect, with a confidence in, and love
								towards this friendly distributor of mercies. If again we examine
								our faculties both of body and mind, the enjoyments of which we are
								capable, especially of a rational sort, and the thirst after
								everlasting life and happiness which every individual feels strongly
								in his breast, notwithstanding the prejudices of education, and the
								wiles of vice and predominant luxury; it becomes more and more
								evident that the Supreme Being deserves our humble adoration, our
								warmest attachment, and our unfeigned love: that we ought to exert
								our faculties in examining and studying the immense and infinite
								powers and perfections of this being; that it should be our chief
								thought and earnest endeavour to imitate, and to approximate the
								bright virtues of this great prototype of perfection and goodness;
								to behave in a manner becoming the many ties and relations by which
								the creator has been pleased to connect us with him and other
								subordinate beings. The above ideas or others to the same purpose,
								form the ground work of true religion, of all natural obligations,
								moral virtues and religious worship. The ideas of the inhabitants of
								the South Sea islands on this head, are we may suppose, less clear,
								perfect and refined: however they acknowledge an almighty invisible
								lord and creator of the universe, who executed the various parts of
								his creation by various subordinate powerful beings. They are of
								opinion that he is good and omniscient; that he sees and hears all
								human actions, and is the giver of all good gifts. They feel their
								own wants, and therefore apply for redress to the Supreme Being, and
								offer to him, with a grateful heart, the best gifts of their lands.
								They acknowledge to have a being within their bodies, which sees,
								hears, smells, tastes, and feels, which they call E-teŠhee; and they
								believe, that after the dissolution of the body, it hovers about the
								corpse; and lastly, retires into the wooden representations of human
								bodies, erected near their burying places. They are convinced of the
								certainty of a happy life in the sun, where they shall feast on
								breadfruit, and meat which requires no dressing; and they think it
								their duty to direct their prayers to this Supreme Divinity, or
								Eato•a-rah...i. Those who have more leisure among these people, are
								very desirous of learning what is known relative to this and all
								other inferior divinities, and to practise such virtues, as by the
								general consent of mankind constitute good actions; these are
								briefly the general outlines of their religion and worship.</p><p n="632">Though these principles are generally adopted among the greater part
								of mankind, provided they are not so much degraded and debased as to
								have lost even these universally acknowledged notions of the Deity,
								and of the duties we owe him; there is, however, no impropriety in
								believing that these very notions are the venerable remains of a
								tradition, which may have been brought over from the Asiatic
								continent. We do not, however, mean to insinuate, as if their
								notions of the Deity and his worship were of such a complexion that
								they could not have been learnt but by tradition; there are,
								however, many reasons which confirm me in this opinion; first, as
								their language, their manners, customs, and many other
								circumstances, prove the Asiatic origin of the nation, why should we
								not also suspect their religious principles to have been derived
								from the same source: secondly, the indolence and supineness of
								mankind is so great in most matters, which require reasoning,
								attention, and judgment, or which, suppose a great many abstract
								ideas, that we rather choose to follow a beaten track, than to
								strike out a new one, by dint of argumentation, and by a constant
								exertion of attention and judgment. It seems therefore more natural,
								that these nations should have adopted the notions of their
								ancestors or forefathers, than to imagine that they formed the whole
								system of their religion, by the mere strength of their
								understandings. Lastly, there is, beyond all doubt, so great an
								agreement between the religious principles of Taheitee, and its
								neighbourhood, and these of the rest of the East, that we cannot
								hesitate a moment in pronouncing them to have been imported from
								Asia; nay, if we go one step further in our enquiry, we must soon
								find, that there is not a country, nor a nation existing, which has
								not preserved some ideas in their religion, which, when attended to,
								prove that they were handed down to them by tradition: now, by going
								backward into remote ages, there must be at last a place where we
								must stop; and this, though ever so remote in antiquity, seems to
								have obtained these notions from the very source. Mankind,
								collectively in its infant state, is exactly as the individual in
								the first years of his existence: the ideas of a Supreme Being, and
								the obligation of worshipping him, are by no means of such a
								clearness and evidence, that they should be easily discovered by a
								child; those who have the care of his education are therefore
								solicitous, at this early period, when the faculties of
								apprehending, judging, and reasoning, are not yet developed of
								strong enough in the child, to treat the great truth of the
								existence of God, and the obligation of worshipping him as a
								precept, or as an universally acknowledged, indisputable axiom; and
								inculcate it as such into the minds of their children. Afterwards,
								when they find the faculties, by exercise and education, to be more
								enlarged, and to have acquired more strength, they lead their pupils
								back, and teach them to investigate the existence of God and his
								attributes, together with the nature and obligation of worshipping
								him, by arguments and by the force of reasoning. Divine Providence
								seems then in this respect, to have treated mankind like children;
								and to have given the first notions of himself and his existence, as
								an axiom, and inforced its worship by precept, conforming these
								great and salutary truths to the infant state of mankind; as long
								therefore as the use of reason and of the intellectual faculties is
								not yet practised in a nation, these religious notions must be
								communicated by precept and tradition: but as soon as men feel
								themselves strong enough, they will no longer trust to tradition,
								the instructor of their childhood, in this great and interesting
								truth, and soon find that it is impossible to be mistaken in this
								important argument, as the existence of this Infinite Being is
								written with so legible characters in every object surrounding them:
								they soon go back to themselves, and investigate their own mental
								and sensual faculties, and from thence are gradually led to
								acknowledge the duties they owe to God, themselves, and all the
								rational, animated, organic, and inanimated creation, which they
								either find co-operating with, or subordinate to themselves. The
								people at Taheitee preserve their notions relative to the Deity and
								his worship by tradition, and are as yet unable to investigate the
								necessity of the existence of God, the nature of his attributes, and
								the duties they owe him by reason; they are therefore still in the
								infant state of humanity, not yet ripened to the use of argument and
								reason in religious matters: and, according to the present situation
								of affairs, a long time must pass, before they will be able to bear
								the evidence of these doctrines, and the radiancy of this truth; we
								have only therefore to wish that we may be permitted to see the
								minds of these excellent people irradiated by the bright religion
								taught by nature and reason; which may prepare them for a due
								reception of the doctrines of the Christian dispensation.</p><p n="633">Their present system of religion is a polytheism, which may be called
								one of the best and least exceptionable as yet known. The name
								Eato1/2a, admits a very great latitude in its interpretation; for
								though it properly signifies a Divinity, it may likewise be
								interpreted a Genius. However they admit a Being whom they call
								Eato•a-rah...i, which is the supreme Deity above all. Each of the
								isles surrounding Taheitee, has its peculiar god, or as we may
								justly call it, its tutelar Divinity. Taheitee is under the peculiar
								guidance and government of OrÁa-h²ttoo; over Huaheine presides T²ne;
								over O-Raiedea Or1/2o: over O-Tah... Orra; Borabora has its
								Ta1/2otoo; Maurooa its Ot1/2o; and in Tabua-m...noo Tar1/2a is the
								chief god. This is always the Divinity whom the high priest of each
								isle addresses in his prayers at the grand Marai of the prince of
								that island. The great Deity they think to be the prime cause of all
								divined and human beings and as this nation has introduced every
								where the idea of generation, it has applied the system of
								generation to the origin of their inferior Divinities, and for that
								purpose the natives though it likewise necessary to attribute to the
								Eatooa-rahai, a being of the female sex, from whose conjunction all
								the inferior Eato•as, and even mankind are descended; and in this
								respect they call the great Deity Ta-roa-t'eay-eto1/2moo the great
								procreating stem: but his wife is not of the same nature with him;
								their gross ideas imagined a coexisting material hard substance
								necessary, which they call O-te-p²pa a rock. These procreated
								O-he¶na the goddess who created the moon, and presides in the black
								cloud which appears in this luminary; Te-whettoo-ma-tar²i the
								creator of the stars; Oomarr¶e the God and creator of the Seas; and
								Orre-1/2rre*<ref target="#jf187"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf187">* Orree signifies wind.</note></ref> who is the God of the Winds. But the sea is under the
								direction of 13 Divinities, who all have some peculiar employment,
								as their name often seems to imply: their names are the following:
								1. Ooroo-h²ddoo, 2. Tamao1/2ee, 3. Ta-²pee, 4. Atoo-aree1/2no, 5.
								Tan¶ea, 6. Tahou-me-1/2nna, 7. Ota-ma-1/2u-we,=<ref target="#jf188"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf188">= Ma-•u signifies a shark.</note></ref> 8. Owh²i,×<ref target="#jf189"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf189">× Owh...i is called a stone or pebble.</note></ref> 9.
								O-wh²tta, 10. Ta-ho"a, 11. Teoo-t-eºya,Ë<ref target="#jf190"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf190">Ë T'eiya is a fish or a sail of a canoe.</note></ref> 12. Oma-h1/2oroo, 13.
								O-wh²ddoo. The great God Taroa-t'eai-eto1/2moo lives in the sun, and
								is represented as a man, who has fine hair, reaching down to the
								very ground; he is thought to be the cause of the earthquakes, in
								which case the natives call him O-maoÁwe, and he is likewise the
								creator of the sun; a rude representation of this deity, under the
								attribute of O-Mao-we, was observed by Captain Cook, in 1769, when
								he made the tour of Taheitee in a boat: it was formed of
								basket-work, and covered with black and white feathers. This is the
								only instance of a figure or representation of their divinities
								which I ever heard of; and Capt. Cook does not mention that any
								respect or reverence was paid to this rude figure of Mao-we. The
								natives have a tradition that the great Deity procreated the
								inferior divinities, each of whom created the part of the world
								allotted to his peculiar care: one the seas, another the moon, the
								stars, the birds, fishes, &amp;c. &amp;c. O-Mao-we created the sun,
								and then took the immense rock O-Te-p...pa, his wife, and dragged
								her from West to East through the seas: when the isles, which the
								natives now inhabit, were broken off; after which he left his great
								land to the East, where it still exists. The care and government of
								each island was committed to the inferior divinities, enumerated
								before. The god T...ne, is not more particularly addressed than the
								rest of his brother divinities, nor is he supposed to take a greater
								part in the affairs of mankind,*<ref target="#jf191"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf191">* Hawkesworth, vol. ii. p. 239.</note></ref> except at Huaheine, which place is
								under his peculiar inspection, and where he is worshipped as the
								tutelar divinity of that country. Besides these divinities of the
								second class, there are others of a still inferior rank, and though
								called Eatooas, are no more than what the Greek or Roman
								Mythologists would have called Genii, or Dii Minorum Gentium:3 one
								of them, called Orometo1/2a, is of a malignant disposition, resides
								chiefly near the Marais and Toopapous (places of burial) and in or
								near the boxes, or little chests, including the heads of their
								deceased friends, each of which, on that account, is called
								Te-wharre no te Orometo•a, the house of the evil genius Orometo•a.
								The people at Taheitee are of opinion, that if their priests invoke
								this evil genius, he will kill, by a sudden death, the person on
								whom they intend to bring down the vengeance of this divinity. Their
								priests are, I suppose, not the most conscientious persons, and, if
								bribed, will not scruple to poison the man who is devoted to
								destruction, and afterwards ascribe the sudden death of such a
								person to the malignity of Orometo•a; and this seems to be the more
								probable, as I was told with the strongest asseveration, that it was
								not uncommon to see the prayers of the priests to their Orometo•a
								fulfilled. I heard likewise of another genius, or inferior divinity,
								called OromehouhoÁwe, who had the same power of killing men, with
								this difference only, that he was not addressed by prayer, but is
								only worshipped by hissing.**<ref target="#jf192"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf192">** It is remarkable that this mode of worshipping the deity or a genius by hissing was likewise adopted by the Egyptian Priests according to the testimony of Nicomachus Gerasenus Harmon. Manual. 1. ii. (in Meibomii auctoribus Antiquae Musicae, vol. i. p. 37) [Greek quote omitted here from page 542 of original]. Harmonia pefsicit potestates operatrices &amp;amp; divinorum effectivas. Quare Theurgici, cum sanctissimo colunt numen aliquod, invocant illud sibilis &amp;amp; poppysmis, sonisque qui articulationes &amp;amp; consonas non habent.4</note></ref> The last kind of genius is called
								T¶ehee; the natives told us, that was the thing which sees, hears,
								smells, tastes, and feels within us, which forms the thoughts,Q<ref target="#jf193"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf193">Q The Taheiteans have no expressions for abstract ideas. Thoughts certainly do not convey a corporeal idea, and required therefore a peculiar turn in order to be expressed by words: the Taheiteans have called them parou no te oboo words of the belly.</note></ref> and,
								after death, exists separately from the body, but lives near the
								burying places, and hovers about the corpse or bones, deposited
								there, is likewise an object of their reverence, though addressed
								only by hissing: they informed us farther, that these TŠehees
								inhabit chiefly the wooden figures, which are erected near the
								marais; and are, according to the sex of the person deceased, either
								males or females: they are likewise dreaded; for according to their
								belief, they creep, during night, into the houses, and eat the heart
								and entrails of the people sleeping therein, and thus cause their
								death.</p><p n="634">The inhabitants of Taheitee shew their reverence to their divinities
								in various manners, first by the appropriation of certain places for
								religious worship, which they call Mar²i. These places are commonly
								on points projecting into the sea, or near it, and consist of a very
								large pile of stones, generally in the shape of an Egyptian pyramid,
								with large steps; sometimes this pyramid makes one of the sides of
								an area, walled in with square stones and paved with flat stones:
								the pyramid is not solid, but the inside is filled with smaller
								fragments of coral stones. Sometimes there are one or more sheds
								standing at a little distance from the marai, for the reception of
								such people as attend the marai on account of praying or performing
								the funeral rites of their relations. Sometimes there are spars
								fixed in the ground and joined by cross beams in a firm frame at a
								small distance from the marai, and likewise small stages raised on
								pillars of various heights and dimensions. The stages are called
								Whattas, and are intended for the reception of the hogs, dogs, fowls
								and fruits, which the natives offer to their gods. The large frame
								is sometimes thirty feet high, and about twenty or more wide, and
								often entirely covered with bananas hung up for the gods with many
								garlands of flowers, and ornamented with green branches.*<ref target="#jf194"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf194">* The plants employed for that purpose are chiefly the Poor...oo or Ep•oa-tar•oroo or Crataeva, the
									E-m•too Melastoma malabathrica, and the Awa-waidai or Piper latifolium.</note></ref> Lastly,
								near the marais are twenty or thirty single pieces of wood fixed
								into the ground, carved all over on one side with figures about
								eighteen inches long, rudely representing a man and a woman
								alternately, so that often more than fifteen or twenty figures may
								be counted on one piece of wood, called by them TeŠhee. To ornament
								the marais and to honour by it the gods and the decayed buried
								there, the inhabitants plant several sorts of trees, near them;
								above all the Casuarina equisetifolia or Toa-tree is the most
								common, not only in Taheitee and its neighbourhood, but even in the
								Friendly islands; where exceeding large trees were observed by us,
								near their Affayeto•cas or places of burial and worship. The
								Tam...noo or Calophyllum inophyllum, is likewise planted near the
								Marais, as is the E-meero or Hibiscus populaeus; with the Ewharra or
								Athrodactylis; and lastly the EtŠe or Dracaena terminalis, of which
								there is one variety with red flowers, and red veins in the leaves,
								with many others.</p><p n="635">The second mark of reverence paid to their divinities, consists in
								the appointment of certain days appropriated for their worship.
								Though I cannot with any precision point out any day which they
								peculiarly celebrated as an anniversary feast or holiday; it is
								nevertheless certain from the accounts I repeatedly heard, that they
								did observe some days as feasts.</p><p n="636">Another way of declaring their respect for their divinities is the
								appointment of certain persons for the peculiar performance of
								prayers, rites, and ceremonies. Each great chief or king of an
								island chooses from among the inferior chiefs an intelligent person;
								who is to be his Tah•uwa or priest; whose business it is to pray and
								offer up sacrifices, and to perform the rites which are deemed
								requisite on each occasion. This dignity is hereditary and descends
								to the son. Each chief of a province has likewise a priest, and the
								inferior ranks of people have in the same manner peculiar priests,
								who cannot perform rites and offer up prayers for men of a higher
								class: it is observed by Hawkesworth, vol. ii. p. 239. that even the
								priests for the males cannot perform the same office for the
								females; and that each sex has marais, to which the other sex is
								never admitted, though they have marais common to both. These
								circumstances indeed we never heard, but it is not improbable that
								they have these singularities in their mode of worshipping.</p><p n="637">The acts of devotion, which these nations pay to their divinities are
								likewise of various kinds: the first is the invocation or prayer
								addressed to one of their deities. The prayers themselves are either
								spoken loud or offered tacitly by the priest: for each peculiar
								ceremony they have short sentences, which they deliver on that
								occasion; the language seems to be more formal, sententious, and
								almost totally different from that used in common life: for none of
								us were able to understand the least sentence of their prayers,
								though we were possessed of large vocabularies, and had acquired a
								tolerable share of knowledge of their language. Besides the prayers
								which the priests of each class deliver upon certain occasions, the
								laymen themselves are not excluded from saying their own prayers,
								and performing many ceremonies of their worship: for when a young
								man at Taheitee, in 1773, chose to sail with us to Huaheine, before
								he eat his supper, he repeated a kind of prayer, and took a very
								small piece of the fish, which was intended for his supper, and laid
								it near him on the table, as an offering for the Eato•a. The natives
								told me when I enquired about their mode of worship, that the priest
								sometimes delivered his prayer so low that nobody could hear any
								thing, yet he was heard by the Eato•a, who is then near the marai,
								and speaks to the priest again, and though there were ever so many
								people present they could not hear a single word spoken by the
								Eatooas, whereas the priest (Tahouwa) understood it all. The
								inferior divinities according to our former observation are revered
								only by a hissing sound.</p><p n="638">A native of the Society-isles no sooner comes within sight of a
								marai, than he strips his garment from his shoulders, and pays it
								the same respect which he shews his prince, by uncovering his
								shoulders: which most undoubtedly proves that a very peculiar
								reverence is shewn to the place, and which they would not do, unless
								they were persuaded, that a being of a superior rank lived there,
								and well deserved such a mark of reverence.</p><p n="639">Not contented with prayers and mere professions, delivered by words,
								the natives of these islands endeavour likewise to add to them some
								sacrifices of the animals and fruit of their country. I have
								frequently seen hogs, dogs, or fowls roasted, covered with a fine
								piece of cloth, and exposed on a kind of altar, built near the marai
								for that purpose: I likewise saw great scaffoldings in the
								neighbourhood of the marai, wholly covered with bananas, and
								plantanes, as sacrifices or offerings to their gods; but I never saw
								any thing else offered to their divinities, nor did I ever hear that
								they sacrifice men. However, as Captain Cook seems to have
								investigated the subject very carefully,*<ref target="#jf195"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf195">* See Cook's Voyage, vol. i. p. 185.</note></ref> it is not improbable=<ref target="#jf196"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf196">= Almost all the antient nations sacrificed men; the Egyptians excepted; who never were addicted to this cruel and barbarous custom; and wherever it is mentioned in old writers that the Egyptians practised this method in order to appease the anger of their gods, it is to be understood of the Arabian shepherds, who undoubtedly were used to reconcile their divinities by human sacrifices, and who once had over-run and conquered all Egypt. On the subject of averting the anger of the gods, by the effusion of human blood, among all nations none has written with greater learning, than the ingenious Mr. Bryant, in his Observations and Inquiries relating to various Parts of ancient History, p. 267-285.</note></ref> that
								they think it expedient to punish their criminals in this manner, by
								devoting them as sacrifices to their God: nay, as we have already
								mentioned,×<ref target="#jf197"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf197">× See Cook's Voyage, p. 327, and likewise p. 358, 359, and 360.</note></ref> that in more remote times canibalism was introduced
								among the Taheiteans, and the inhabitants of the Society Isles, it
								is highly probable that these human sacrifices, are the remains of
								the canibalism of these islanders; with this difference, that they
								now stay and offer the criminals to the Gods, without eating them;
								whereas they formerly added that inhumanity and barbarism. Though
								the restriction of killing only bad men, for the reconciliation of
								the favour of their Gods, seems very much to mitigate this cruel
								custom, and by all appearances sanctifies the impious rite into a
								legal necessary action; it is, however, again debased in the most
								detestable manner, by leaving the choice of the person, who is to be
								devoted to the gods to the caprice of the High Priest; who, on this
								occasion, has an opportunity, not only of indulging his private
								revenge against any man, by whom he may think himself injured, but
								also of practising at the same time one of the most abominable
								scenes of priest-craft that ever took place; for it is said, that on
								certain occasions, when the nation is solemnly assembled, the High
								Priest alone enters the house of God, or the marai, and after
								staying there for some time, he returns and informs the
								congregation, that having conversed with their great God, he was
								ordered to ask for a human sacrifice, and then mentions the person
								whom the deity desired to have offered; this man is immediately
								seized and killed, being beaten till he be dead. The circumstance,
								that such criminals only as had nothing wherewithal to redeem
								themselves, are devoted to death, proves besides, that the priest
								has an opportunity of satisfying his avarice. What has been hitherto
								said on this peculiar part of the religious worship practised in the
								Society isles, confirms us more and more in that general truth, that
								the greater part of mankind, when left to themselves, in their
								religious principles, and modes of worship, have always more or less
								deviated from that noble simplicity, which the true adoration in the
								spirit and truth requires, and which is so fully held forth in the
								Christian dispensation; wherein the ideas of the Deity are pure, and
								capable of filling the mind with humility, confidence, and
								adoration, and prompting every professor of that religion, to the
								practice of all moral and social virtues, and lastly, excluding all
								priest-craft from its true and genuine votaries.</p><p n="640">The human sacrifices being left to the choice of the priest, who
								pretends to converse with the Deity, intimate, that these nations
								have some idea of a communication of the will and pleasure of the
								Deity, by means of their priests. I was told, that in dubious cases
								of great consequence, the priest did actually consult the divinity,
								and pretended to bring back the answer to the people; which seems to
								imply that their marais are looked upon as oracles, where the Deity
								may be consulted, and his answer is plainly heard by the priest, and
								communicated to those who desire to be instructed, and guided by it.
								This idea has likewise pervaded all mankind, for there is hardly a
								nation to be found, either antient or modern, which had it not
								inserted amongst its religious tenets, that the Deity had reserved
								to himself the prerogative of instructing mankind on the most
								important occasions, especially such as greatly influence their
								happiness.</p><p n="641">The Taheiteans relate, that the great god Tar1/2a-t'eay-e-to1/2moo,
								having by his wife O-te-p²pa, begotten many divinities of both
								sexes, who created the various parts of this world, and who now
								preside over them; having likewise produced the various isles, by
								dragging O-Te-p...pa through the seas, he at last begot by her a son
								called O-t¶a, who was the first man: and according to their
								tradition, his limbs were all rolled up in a figure like a ball, but
								his mother carefully expanded them to the shape in which men now
								appear. A daughter was likewise begotten by the same parents, whose
								name is O-te-t1/2rro, who became the wife of O-t¶a, and from this
								couple they believe all mankind to have been descended. This
								traditional history of the origin of mankind, accounts at once for
								many points of their religion and philosophy: first, as they think
								man to have been born of their great gods it is plain that they must
								think their deities similar to mankind, in their external
								appearance, and this is confirmed by the figure of Maouwe, which
								Capt. Cook met with in his first voyage. Secondly, though they
								always protested that God could not be seen, they had, however, made
								a human figure to represent Maouwe, which seems to intimate that
								this representation of a god, was rather reckoned to be a symbolical
								figure, than a real representation. Thirdly, since they believe that
								the being which is possessed of sensation and of thinking, or as
								they call it, of forming the speech in the belly (paro--no-te-•boo)
								exists after death in a separate state, and is then even unseen
								capable of actions similar to those it performed when combined with
								the body, viz. of seeing, hearing, receiving pleasure from the
								actions of their friends, and of shewing its displeasure by killing
								people; it is evident that they think of an invisible being, very
								distinct from the body, and endowed with a free agency. This they
								call Te¶hee and represent it frequently under the rude figure of a
								man or woman, seldom exceeding eighteen inches in heighth; which
								again seems to indicate that this figure is not intended to be the
								real figure of the invisible soul, but only its emblem. Fourthly, as
								they think man to have descended from their supreme deity, it is
								evident they must likewise imagine man to be in some inferior degree
								homogeneous to their divinities, or vice versa their divinities are
								according to their opinion analogous to man, and as they often told
								me the great Eato•a could not be seen, or in other words was
								invisible, this analogy cannot lie in the body the only visible part
								of man, and must therefore consist in the part capable of thinking
								and reasoning, which in some measure is analogous to the scriptural
								phrase of the image of God, after which man was first made. Lastly,
								as they attribute to O-T¶a the first man but one wife, this
								circumstance seems to imply that they think monogamy to be the
								lawful or most reasonable method for propagating mankind.</p><p n="642">The inhabitants of the South Sea have certainly some notions of a
								future state; but I must confess, I am at a loss how to conciliate
								their ideas on that head. They told us that the being, which had
								sensations and thoughts, did not decay with the body but was well
								(wo-ra) and existing near its old habitation the body and the
								remains exposed on an elevated stage, or even near the bones when
								buried, or the head preserved in a little chest: it is for this
								being that they expose various fruits and meat near the burying
								place; and the little wooden images or TeŠhees are, as we were told,
								the receptacles of the invisible TeŠhees, or what we would call
								souls, according to our way of thinking. And notwithstanding this
								most positive assertion, they told us almost in the same breath,
								that after their death the departed met in the sun, and attended
								Ma•uwe, and feasted there with this deity upon bread-fruit, and the
								meat of hogs or dogs, which needs no dressing; and some even
								ventured to say that they were to have a constant succession of
								liquor prepared from ...wa (Piper methysticum). This state they call
								the meeting or assembly of the heavens or sky (Touro•a-t'er...i).*<ref target="#jf198"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf198">* The word Tooro•a signifies the meeting or assembly of the states in Taheitee, wherein the king, the chiefs of provinces, priests, inferior chiefs, and manahounes have a right to sit, but the hoas, or king's attendants, though present, must stand.</note></ref>
								However the people of rank only, have hopes of being received in
								this assembly of the heavens after their demise; and perhaps this
								idea is formed from the Touro•a or meeting of the states of the
								nation, where only the higher ranks of the nation have a right to
								sit. The toutous or lower sort of people meet after death at the
								taya-h•boo, which I am unable to explain. We never heard that any of
								these places was to be considered as a state of punishment. The
								Touro•a-t'er...i seems to be a place of enjoyment and happiness, in
								some measure similar to the Valhalla of the Northern nations, where
								the heroes killed in battle met at Odin's palace, feasted upon the
								meat of the boar Serimmer,**<ref target="#jf199"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf199">** See the Edda, in various places, and likewise Jo. George Keysler's Antiquitates Selectas Septentrionales, p. 149. seq.</note></ref> and drank ale or mead out of the skulls
								of their enemies. The actions of men do not seem to influence in the
								least their future state according to their doctrine: but I am fully
								persuaded, that the people of these islands were frequently awed
								from committing bad immoral actions by the fear of meriting the
								displeasure and the anger of the Gods; for when I discoursed with
								them upon various subjects, and in order to try their way of
								thinking and principles, asked them why they did not kill their
								children or any other persons, they always replied the Gods would be
								angry: when I continued to ask whether this anger or displeasure
								would cause punishments to be inflicted, they constantly answered in
								the affirmative; when I asked whether this anger would take place
								after death, they still affirmed it; but I never could obtain any
								information concerning the method, place and duration of the anger
								of their Gods for such crimes. Nay, having one day attempted to
								dissuade Teinamai from killing the child that she was shortly to
								bring forth, and seeing her obstinate in her design, I represented
								upon this very ground to her, that the Eato•a would be very angry
								(w•riddee) on that account against her; but she very coolly replied,
								that this might perhaps be the case of the Eato•a no Pret...nee i.e.
								the British God, but the Eato•a of O-RaiedŠa knew her to be with
								child by an Arreeoy; whose children must not live, and would
								therefore not be angry. From the above account however I think we
								have reason to conclude that they are not quite without some notions
								of a future state attended with rewards and punishments. Their
								religion therefore is not altogether disinterested, but greatly
								influences their morals; and in my opinion seems well adapted to the
								weak and infant state of their reason; and though they go through
								all the acts of reverence and adoration both by words and actions,
								they certainly perform them with a childish simplicity and humility,
								from the little knowledge they have early imbibed of the greatness,
								goodness, and excellence of the Supreme Being, and likewise because
								they have been taught to dread the anger and displeasure of a being
								whose power is infinitely superior to that of any other they have an
								idea of.</p><p n="643">After the birth of a child, they do not observe any ceremonies
								whatever, excepting that of depressing in some degree its nose, and
								giving it a name from some object or other which is nearest at hand,
								or which from some circumstance becomes remarkable. The king of
								Taheitee was called O-Too, which is the name of a grey heron: the
								chief of the isle of St. Christina, one of the Marquesa-islands, was
								called Ah•noo, which signifies a turtle; one of the chiefs at
								Taheitee related to O-Too was called TeŠhee the soul or a carved
								figure, which is the symbol or emblem of the soul. The chief of the
								province of Tittah...w had the name of Toum...ta-r•a a great hat,
								and many more of that nature, much too tedious to mention. However
								in this early period of life, the male children undergo a ceremony
								or operation on their genitals, for a piece of bamboo reed is thrust
								into the prepuce, and the membrane slit by means of another
								bamboo-reed, (to which a very sharp edge is given by tearing it) in
								order to prevent its contracting over and covering the glans. This
								operation is performed merely from principles of cleanliness, by the
								priest, though there is not any religion or religious ceremony mixed
								with the custom; for which reason it is not performed on a certain
								day after the birth of the child, nor at any certain age; but when
								the child is capable of attending to it, that the prepuce may not
								again join over the glans, then the operation is made, which, from
								its nature cannot properly be called a circumcision. Both sexes have
								many marks on their skin, made by puncturing the part with a toothed
								instrument of bone, dipt into lamp black and water, and by this
								method they imprint marks which are indelible for life. The men have
								sometimes not only a black part on their buttocks, but sometimes on
								the arms and even their sides, and various other parts of the body
								marked in this manner. The toothed instrument is called
								Eo•wee-tatatta•u, a spatula of wood, with which they constantly stir
								the black colour, and on one end of which they have contrived a kind
								of small club of the thickness of a finger, is the second instrument
								employed on this occasion; with the small club they give repeated
								gentle strokes on the toothed instrument, in order to make it pierce
								the skin. This spatula is called Tat...‰, and the black colour
								araho...-tatt...ou. The arches which they design on the buttocks
								obtain the name of av...ree; the parts which are one mass of black
								on the buttocks are named toum...rro, and the arches which are thus
								designed on the buttocks of their females, and are honourable marks
								of their puberty, are called toto-ho•wa: the priests are the only
								persons entitled to perform these operations, and are paid for their
								trouble in cloth, fowls, fish, and after the natives had obtained
								European commodities, in nails and beads.</p><p n="644">In their marriages some ceremonies are observed, but the authorities
								we have for talking of them are of no great weight, because the only
								people who were present, did not understand enough of the language,
								to obtain information relative to the signification of several
								transactions and ceremonies they saw performed in their presence.
								The young Borabora man Maheine was married to the daughter of
								TopŠrre chief of the district of Matavai, during our second stay at
								Taheitee. We were told that he had been sitting on the ground by the
								side of his bride, holding her hand in his, being surrounded by ten
								or twelve persons, chiefly women, who repeated some words in a
								recitative or singing tone, to which Maheine and his bride gave some
								short responses: some food was presented to them, and Maheine gave a
								part of it to his bride and she to him, which action was likewise
								accompanied by certain words, and lastly they bathed in the river.
								This is the whole account of the ceremony, which has been observed
								and recounted. Persons of little curiosity with a very slender
								knowledge of the language, were certainly not the best qualified for
								enquiring into the reason and signification of any transaction or
								ceremony, and we did not hear of those circumstances till we had
								quitted the isle, otherwise we should have endeavoured to obtain
								some information on that head.</p><p n="645">The ceremonies usually performed on the demise of persons of rank in
								Taheitee are more curious than any other seen or described, and
								contain briefly the following circumstances. As soon as the person
								is known to be dead, the relations and friends resort to the house
								he occupied when alive, and there join in lamentations and other
								signs of grief over the loss of their friend, which continues all
								that day and night, till the next morning; when the body is wrapped
								in some of their white cloth, and carried to the neighbourhood of
								the marai, where the remains of the deceased in future are to be
								deposited; if that place be distant, the corpse is carried in a boat
								and conveyed thither on a bier covered by a little thatch in the
								form of a small house. The corpse is then carried near the shore,
								attended during the whole time by the priest; who repeats some
								prayers before the corpse is taken, and continues to repeat them
								till he reaches the marai. He then renews his prayers and sentences,
								and sprinkles sea-water towards the body, but not upon it; which is
								repeated several times, the body having been taken away and carried
								back each time; till at last a small inclosure being made near the
								marai, and a kind of open shed called Tupap1/2u,*<ref target="#jf200"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf200">* One of the Tupapous is represented in Cook's Voyage, vol. i. p. 185. pl. xliv. and another in Hawkesworth, vol. ii. p. 234, pl. No. v.</note></ref> raised on posts
								six or seven feet from the ground, being finished, the corpse or
								bier is deposited under the shed either on posts or on a stage made
								on purpose, and left there till the flesh putrifies and separates
								from the bones. Meat, fruit, and water are often brought to the
								Tupap•u and left at a small distance from it; nor do the relations
								forget to ornament the Tupap•u with cloth and garlands of the
								ewharra-fruit (Athrodactylis) and coconut-leaves. And near it are
								generally to be seen one or more trees of the kind called Casuarina
								equisetifolia. The female relations testify their grief by tears and
								by cutting the crown of the head with a shark's tooth: the blood
								flowing from the wound as well as the tears shed on this solemn
								occasion are received on pieces of their cloth and then thrown under
								the bier, as well as the hair cut off by some young people on this
								occasion. Some days after these ceremonies have been performed, one
								of the nearest relations takes up the hŠva-dress described before p.
								306, 307 and holding in one hand a clapper made of two large mother
								of pearl shells; and in the other a flat cudgel set with shark's
								teeth along its edge, he begins a solemn procession from the house
								of the deceased by a long circuit to the Tupap•u, preceded by two or
								more people almost naked and blackened by a mixture of charcoal and
								water, who are called Nin¶va i.e. insane or mad, supposing them to
								be transported by the phrenzy of grief, for if the chief mourner
								performing the hŠva, should happen to meet any person during his
								circuit, he would run at them and strike them with the shark's teeth
								fixed on his stick. For which reason, no sooner is the noise of the
								two shells heard, than every one leaves his habitation and
								endeavours to obtain shelter at a distance, and out of the reach of
								the shark's teeth: near the corpse, and the places where men live, a
								kind of sentence or prayer is pronounced. This procession is
								performed for about five moons at certain intervals; which become
								less frequent at the end of the interval than at the beginning; each
								relation takes this procession in his turn, and now and then the
								priests in company, and at the desire of the relations repeat their
								prayers near the corpse and offer to their deities some offerings of
								fruit or meat. After the flesh is decayed, the bones are scraped,
								washed, and buried in the marai, if the person deceased was a chief,
								but without if he belonged not to that class. The skull of a chief
								is not buried with the bones, but wrapped in cloth and put in a long
								box*<ref target="#jf201"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf201">* The method of disposing of the corpse of the dead at Taheitee, seems to be at first sight very strange, but upon more mature examination, the same practice is found to obtain among many other nations, both antient and modern. When I was in Russia in the summer of the year 1765, I observed in the great desert to the East of the Volga, several Khalmyks exposed in the same manner for putrefaction. I saw one lying dead in a hut in his cloth; I found round the hut several callico and silk vanes on long sticks fixed in the ground, on which several lines in Tibetan characters were printed. I met with another corpse in a little house of wood six feet long and two feet wide, and when I came near a fox escaped out of it, who had been preying on the dead body: besides the vanes above mentioned, the khalmyks had fixed about this sepulchre pieces of wood pierced in the middle by a hole, through which the sticks were thrust on which the wooden vanes almost constantly moved by the least breath of wind; these pieces of wood were on the two opposite sides hollowed out like spoons of about seven or eight inches long and five wide, and covered on the hollow part with Tibetan characters. The lamas or priests of the khalmyks say that as often as the vane or this wooden instrument moves round, the substance of the prayers for the repose of the deceased, is as it were offered up to God. In the Archaeologia of the Society of Antiquaries of London, vol. ii. p. 233 is inserted a Memoir, written in 1767; wherein I have described the six modes of burial usual among those who follow the religion of the Dalai-lama. According to the first mode they burn the corpse of their Lamas, Khans, Noions, and other people of rank, and preserve their ashes mixed with frank-incense, and send the whole to the Dalai-lama in Tibet. 2. They keep the bodies in a coffin and afterwards cover them with stones. 3. Some are carried to the tops of mountains and left there a prey to birds and beasts. 4. Some are carried to an inclosure full of dogs, and there the burier feeds the dogs with the flesh severed from the bones, and casts the bones into the water, and gives the skull to the relations of the deceased, who carry it respectfully home. 5. Some corpses are thrown into the water. 6. Others are buried under ground. The mode of burial is fixed and determined upon by the priest according to the hour in which a person dies, as each time requires a different way of burying. These circumstances are confirmed by Dr. P.S. Pallas, F.R.S. in his Travels through several Provinces of the Russian Empire, vol. i. p. 362, 363 and partly by John Stewart, Esq. F.R.S. in his account of the Kingdom of Tibet, in the Philos. Trans. vol. lxvii. pl. ii. p. 478. In the island of Formosa or Tayovan the inhabitants keep the corpses of their deceased in their houses on an elevated stage, and put fire under them in order to dry them, after the ninth day they wrap the body in mats and cloth, and expose them on a still higher stage; after the body has been thus kept during three years the bones are buryed. Relation of the Island of Formosa by Candidius. The people in Corea do not bury the remains of their deceased friends till after three years are elapsed. Du Halde's Hist. of China. The indians upon the river Oronoko suffer the corpses of their chiefs to putrefy and when the flesh is decayed they dress the skeleton with jewels of gold and ornaments of feathers, and suspend it in a hut. See the Voyage of Sir Walter Raleigh in Hakluyt's Voyages, vol. iii. p. 644, edit. 1598. Appollonius Rhodius Argonautic. lib. iii. p. 207.5 and likewise Aelian. var. Historiae, lib. iv. ch. i. mention that the Colchi sew the corpse of their deceased relations in raw hides of oxen, and hang them up by a chain in the air. The inhabitants of Chili put their deceased in the attitude of a child in the mother's womb, and then they expose them on a stage six feet high. Supplement to Anson's Voyage. All these accounts evidently prove, that many nations observe the same custom with regard to the corpses of their deceased friends as at O-Taheitee, in exposing them to putrefaction and afterwards burying the bones only. And though some of them differ somewhat in their method of treating the remains of their relations, there are however others who do not bury them under ground, but sever the flesh from the bones, and preserve the skeleton dressed out and finely ornamented in caves under ground, (such for instance are the customs of the Moluches, Taluhets, and Divihets) or in small huts near the sea coast, sometimes at 300 leagues from their habitations (which is done by the Tehuelhets). See Falkner's Description of Patagonia, p. 118, 120.</note></ref> which the natives call Te-wh...rre-no-te-oromet-a, of which
								mention has been made before p. 362. After this burial of the bones
								the relations now and then renew some funeral ceremonies with the
								priest, who takes a bunch of the red feathers of a parroquet called
								o•ra, and twisted together with coco-nut filaments, and fixes them
								on a small pointed stick in the ground; (these feathers are in high
								estimation with these people and become the emblem of the divinity,
								and serve to fix their attention during the ceremony) opposite to
								this bunch of feathers a young plantane is placed, which is the
								emblem of friendship, peace, and expiation; the priest stands with
								the relations over against the bunch of red feathers and repeats his
								prayers, after which he deposits on the grave some coconut-leaves
								twisted into various shapes and knots during his prayer, and the
								relations likewise leave a few provisions.</p><p n="646">Instead of a man, I saw at O-Taha a woman wear the heva-dress; a
								ceremonious dance was performed at the same place, and the nearest
								relations appeared well dressed with presents of cloth for the
								drummers and musicians. From all the ceremonies of the burial it
								appears, that the people at Taheitee and its neighbourhood, have an
								idea of a separate state, in which the TeŠhee or soul lives though
								not united with the body. I was not able to discover when they
								supposed the soul removed or left the neighbourhood of the corpse
								and the bones. For it has been already observed, that they imagine
								that the chiefs and better sort of people go to M...ouwe into the
								sun and feast on bread-fruit, and meat of dogs and hogs, which
								requires no dressing, in the assembly of heavens or Te-ro•a te-rai.
								The time when the deceased are thought to go to this assembly
								remains therefore unsettled.*<ref target="#jf202"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf202">* We shall in the next chapter give an account of the doctrine of the soul as it is received among the inhabitants of the Caroline islands, which can be employed for the illustration of the doctrine of the Taheiteans.</note></ref> The Egyptian doctrine of the

								seldom understood. The Egyptians were of opinion, that the soul of

								years the same soul again resumed the direction of a human body.**<ref target="#jf203"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf203">** Herodot, lib. ii. No 123.6</note></ref>
								They embalmed the body of the deceased, in order to hinder its decay
								and putrefaction, and to prevent the tedious transmigration of the
								soul through so many bodies of animals, and to facilitate its
								transition from one human body (after the interval of 3000 years)
								into another.=<ref target="#jf204"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf204">= During all that time in which the body was not decayed the Egyptians imagined the soul to remain near it. At Memphis especially was a lake between the burying place and the city, and close to it a fine green meadow, which was the Elysium: for so Servius remarks ad Aeneid. vi.7 Vireta prope Memphin amoena sunt, in quibus Aegyptiorum sepulcra sunt, haec Elysios campos vocant. Palus prope est, loto &amp;amp; calamis plena, &amp;amp; graviter olet. Per hanc paludem vectantur cadavera; hinc dixit Orpheus, vehi per Acherontem.8 Hom. l. 4-Odysseae, ubi loquitur Proteus: sed te Elysium campum, &amp;amp; ultimas terras Dii immortales mittent, &amp;amp;c. &amp;amp;c. Homer in the Odyssey, W 13 calls it: [Greek quote omitted here from footnote on page 565 of original].9 
									A meadow full of herbage, where the soul lives. The words [Greek word - see page 565 or original] and Elysium, have their origin from words in the Egyptian language, which have a reference to fertility, grass, and rushes. Near it were the [Greek words - see page 565 of original] the ports or gates of the sun, i.e. of a temple of serapis or the sun, and [Greek words - see page 565 of original] or that part of the city of Memphis called Leucotiche by Thucydides, lib. i. c. 104.10 The marais of the Taheiteans are constantly near the sea, in a pleasant spot, surrounded by verdure and fine shady trees.</note></ref> This doctrine has furnished a hint for fixing with
								some probability, the time of the departure of the souls of the
								Taheiteans for the Te-ro•a-te-rai; it seems to me to take place when
								all the flesh is entirely decayed, and nothing but bones are left.
								The difference between the doctrine of Egypt and that of Taheitee is
								evident and needs no comment, but it appears that they agreed in
								thinking the soul to remain about the body as long as any flesh
								continued undecayed. I am far from thinking that the people in the
								South Sea derived their sepulchral rites, and their opinions
								relative to the soul from Egypt, for I have frequently observed that
								the same customs are observed at very distant places. It is
								therefore possible that mankind may have accidentally employed upon
								certain occasions the same customs without having an opportunity of
								borrowing them from places so very remote.</p><p n="647">In the Friendly isles, (though we twice visited them) we made a very
								short stay, so that we could not make many observations on their
								religion and the rites and ceremonies that are in any ways related
								to religion; however we find they used the word Eato•ca, we saw one
								of their priests perform some rites, and heard him repeat a long
								prayer, opposite to one of their burying places, called by them
								Affayeto1/2ca.**<ref target="#jf205"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf205">** The name Affayetooca seems to signify the house of God: for farre is a house in the Friendly-isles and E-atooca is in the name of God, which would form the word E-farre-tooca or E-ffaye-tooca.</note></ref> I was told that they buried the remains of their
								deceased friends within the house or Affayeto•ca, which was filled
								with pieces of coral stone. I found in the house two rude figures of
								a man similar to the TeŠhee at Taheitee. I inquired whether they
								called it an Eato•ca, they said no; I again asked how they called
								it, and I was told TeŠghee; I inquired whether they prayed to it,
								this they denied, and kicked the figures with their feet, to shew
								that they did not pay the least respect to them.</p><p n="648">In New-Zeeland, the people were very ignorant in regard to religion,
								however they had the names of Eato•ca and TeŠghee, which latter they
								represented by a small ill shapen figure of a man, cut in the green
								nephritic stone, and this they commonly wore on a string round their
								necks: for as they have no fixed place of abode, but are constantly
								removing, they cannot erect a figure of a TeŠghee on a certain
								place, left it should be destroyed by some hostile party: another
								reason for doing so is, because they never bury the corpses of their
								deceased relations, but sink them with stones in the sea; it is
								therefore impossible to rise any other monuments to the memory of
								their friends, than such as they can wear and carry along with them.
								They likewise went in commemoration of their deceased relations some
								of their teeth about their neck; I have seen some men and women
								wearing whole strings or necklaces of teeth about their necks.</p><p n="649">In Easter-island they bury their dead near the ranges of gigantic
								stone figures, which serve in lieu of the wooden Taheitean TeŠhees,
								(because wood is extremely scarce on their island) for I was told
								that these figures represented their deceased chiefs or hareekees; I
								observed many human bones scattered on the surface of the stone
								parapet wherein the stone pillars were erected. I measured a thigh
								bone by my own and found them nearly of the same length.</p><p n="650">At the Marquesas we discovered no signs of their burying places, as
								none of us penetrated to the top of the hills, where we discovered
								from on board the ships some long stakes standing upright, nearly in
								the same manner as the TeŠhees at Taheitee, and which by several
								were considered as fortifications. Menda¤a saw in the year 1595, in
								the same island, not far from the town, somelthing which he calls
								"an oracle, surrounded with palisades, with the entrance to the
								West, and a house almost in the middle with the door to the North,
								in which were some figures of wood ill wrought, and there were
								offered some eatables, among which was a hog; this the Spanish
								soldiers took down, and wanting to take away other things, the
								Indians hindered them, saying by signs, that they should not touch
								them, intimating that they respected that house and figures."*<ref target="#jf206"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf206">* Dalrymple's Collection of Voyages, vol. i. p. 68.</note></ref> From
								this account it appears to me evident, that the place they saw was a
								place of worship and burying, or in a word a marai. It likewise
								seems to intimate, that they had the same manner of worshipping, the
								same offerings of hogs and other eatables, together with the wooden
								TeŠhees as at Taheitee, and that the whole of their religion and
								notions of divinity are nearly the same as in the Society-isles.</p><p n="651">On Mallicollo we made no observations either on the religion or
								worship of its inhabitants, as we staid only one day on the island.
								I have not the least doubt that the hymns which some of the
								inhabitants at Tanna sung every morning at day break, were part of
								the worship they paid to the divinity, as the solemn tone, and
								stated regularity with which it was heard, seem to confirm this
								opinion. Of their manner of burying we saw not the least vestiges.
								At New Caledonia on the summit of a barren hill we observed stakes
								stuck in the ground, with branches on the top, and a whisp of dry
								grass, and we were told that this was one of their burying places:
								close to the sea-shore we saw likewise an inclosure made of sticks,
								round a tumulus of about four feet high, on which were placed
								several sticks, on the tops of which several large turbines were
								sticking: and we were informed by the natives that this was the
								burying place of the chief of the district. On the island of
								Ballabeea lying to the N.W. of New Caledonia, our people, who were
								sent there by Captain Cook, found a large sepulcral tumulus of one
								of their chiefs, who was killed in battle by the inhabitants of
								Mngha or Minda, a great island situated Northward or North Westward
								of their own isle, and whose natives were warlike and at war with
								them. Lastly I found some miles from the place where our ship was at
								anchor at the foot of the large ridge of hills running along the
								whole island, a house of one of their chiefs, and behind it a range
								of wooden pillars, about ten or twelve inches square, and eight or
								nine feet high, with a carved human head on the top. The old man who
								lived in the above house, intimated to me by signs, that it was his
								burying place, but as we were then in quest of Heeb...i the
								Captain's friend, in order to present him with a boar and a little
								sow, I had not time to inquire more particularly, especially as it
								was the last day before our departure, and I was desirous of
								collecting some birds and plants which I had seen, and which were
								not easily to be obtained. These sepulcres with the carved figure of
								a human head, seem to intimate that the natives of this island had
								almost the same manner of burying the dead, and of fixing a human
								figure or a TeŠhee near it, as the inhabitants of Taheitee.</p><p n="652">The whole account of the religion, worship, and various rites in use
								among the inhabitants of the islands in the South Sea, shew that it
								is the least exceptionable system of polytheism. It has the stamp of
								all the inventions and works of mankind in its imperfection and
								error; but it is in my opinion less cruel, and not so much clogged
								with superstition as many others, which were or still are in use
								among nations who are reputed to be more civilized and more
								improved. Their religion requires of its votaries a kind of worship,
								it teaches them to look upon the deity as the giver of all good
								gifts, as the being who hears their prayers, and is willing to
								assist mankind when invoked, and to reward the good: and these
								doctrines afford the only origin of all honesty, faith, and justice;
								or in a word of all social ties and social virtues, without which
								there would be no comfort, and still less real happiness in human
								societies.</p><p n="653"><q><emph>Atque haud scio, an pietate adversus Deos sublata, fides

								been the result of nine long dissertations, in order the better to
								form a just idea of their real happiness.</p><p n="655">The inhabitants of the isles in the South Sea which we visited, are
								upon the whole very numerous. We found that the farther the nations
								live from the equinoctial line, the less numerous they are, and of
								those within the tropics, they are the most numerous who are more
								civilized than the rest. Though it be highly difficult to ascertain
								the population of Taheitee, it is however possible to form an idea,
								which comes very near to its real numbers. We took an opportunity of
								making some inferences from the number of war canoes, which we saw
								reviewed, and confirmed our conclusions by a view of the size and
								extent of the fertile plain surrounding the isle, by calculating the
								number of bread-fruit trees growing on this plain, and the quantity
								of breadfruit-trees necessary for the support of one man, shewing
								that many more men might receive subsistence than we had allowed.
								This standard afforded us a rule wherewith to compare or to measure
								the population of all other isles; and lastly we supposed more than
								one million of inhabitants to live on the isles which we had seen
								and visited. We observed, that the inhabitants of the islands in the
								South Seas are remarkably different in colour, form, habit, and
								natural turn of mind; and that the people at Taheitee and the
								Society-isles, with those at the Marquesas, the Friendly-isles,
								New-Zeeland and Easter-island seem to constitute a race of men
								entirely different from those as New-Caledonia, Tanna and
								Mallicollo, and all the rest living in the New Hebrides. We added a
								small account of the Pesserais, prefixing to it a dissertation
								proving the existence of a nation taller and more athletic than the
								rest of the American tribes; though not so tall as the fabulous
								accounts of a gigantic race would make them. The causes of the
								difference observed in the races of men are the subject of another
								section. Some suppose men to be divided into species materially and
								essentially different from one another. Others on the contrary are
								of opinion that some races of men as well as the Ouran Outangs are
								different from us, which however is inadmissible if we take into
								consideration the exercise of reason and common sense, the formation
								of ideas, the language of the heart, the refinement of moral
								sentiment, with the gifts of speech founded on the variety, power
								and extent of voice and articulation, and even on the whole
								structure and mechanism of our bodies. The other proposition,
								according to which men are of different species, is equally
								groundless, because the most different species can procreate
								children, and if the different marriages with persons of one kind be
								continued for a few generations, the difference at last entirely
								vanishes. The objection that this difference is so great, that it
								remains incomprehensible how it was originally produced is examined,
								and it is proved that it intirely depends upon physical causes; it
								is likewise shewn that the transition from a fair to a dark
								complexion is very soon brought about, but the contrary requires a
								longer time, and the interval of more generations, and even then is
								scarcely observable: so that if the same race of people should pass
								through a long and gradual circuit, the one through hot countries,
								and the other immediately by a sudden transition to the same
								climate; those who have passed through the fervid climate would
								preserve a darker hue, than those who at once should pass to the
								same without making any stay in the intermediate climates; and both
								would afterwards in the new climate preserve in some measure the hue
								and complexion they brought from the country which they left last:
								upon these premises we ventured to suppose that the two races of men
								in the South Sea arrived there by different routs, and were
								descended from two different sets of men. This surmise might be
								rendered more probable and ripened as it were into fact, if any
								record or historical proof could be alledged in favour of this
								opinion: but how can we expect to find such historical proofs, where
								no records are kept? However the five nations of the first
								enumerated race seem to come from the Northward and by the
								Caroline-islands, the Ladrones, the Manilla and the island of
								Borneo, to have descended from the Malays: whereas on the contrary,
								the black race of men seems to have sprung from the people that
								originally inhabited the Moluccas, and on the approach of the Malay
								tribes withdrew into the interior parts of their isles and
								countries. The language of these two races in some measure proves
								the assertion, especially as it is evident that the five first
								branches speak only dialects of one general language preserving
								several words of the Malay-language; whereas the three tribes of the
								latter race, have not even a similarity of speech among themselves;
								and that none of these languages has the least or most distant
								reference to any American language spoken on the Western coasts of
								America. When we consider the difference in the happiness and
								enjoyments of the various tribes who were visited by us in the
								course of our circum-navigation; it is evident that the nations
								become less happy in proportion as they are removed from the tropics
								and the benign influence of the sun. The warm tropical climates seem
								to have been originally the seat of the human race, which removed to
								the two colder extremities of the globe, when forced either by
								chance or cruel necessity; the wretched and uncomfortable situation
								of the Pesserais and New-Zeelanders, when compared with the real
								state and enjoyment of the Taheiteans, clearly prove that these
								tribes are really debased and degenerated from their original
								happiness, and that the rigours of the climate first influence the
								body and afterwards the mind and the heart. But if we compare the
								inhabitants of the more Western isles in the South Sea with the
								Taheiteans, we find that the latter far surpass the former in every
								respect; which intimates that though the climate greatly influences
								the happiness of a nation, it is however not the only cause of its
								real felicity; that education contributes as much, if not more,
								towards the good state of a people; and that the removal from the
								tropics towards the colder extremities of the globe, together with
								the gradual loss of the principles of education greatly contribute
								to the degeneracy and debasement of a nation into a low and forlorn
								condition. Mankind is therefore to be considered in various
								situations, comparable with the various ages of men from infancy to
								manhood; with this difference only, that men in their collective
								capacity ripen but slowly from animality, through the states of
								savages and barbarians into a civilized society, which has again an
								infinite variety of situations and degrees of perfection. It is
								therefore not to be expected, that from a short and slight
								intercourse with Europeans these nations should make a rapid
								progress in civilization and happiness, especially as other
								concurrent circumstances on our side were against it. We then
								returned to a comparative view of the Pesserais and the Eskimaux,
								and found the former to be in the lowest state of degeneracy and
								debasement. The New-Zeelanders we observed to be infinitely superior
								to them: we then took a view of the most probable means by which the
								poor Pesserais may one day or other emerge into a state one degree,
								at least more remote from their forlorn condition, and that the
								increase of population and want of food may prompt some tribes to
								oppress others; who either will unite in order to resist their
								oppressive brethren, or reduce them to subjection; in both cases
								they must become less unhappy. The barbarian is capable of strong
								exertions of physical and mental powers, and though outrageous and
								violent, is forced by the resistance of others to be guarded and
								cautious, and to unite with others into societies, which sooner or
								later introduce a mildness of manners, so that even the very
								unbounded and irresistible eruptions of their passions in the end
								serve to soften their fierceness and ferocity. Canibalism, one of
								the most inhumane and atrocious customs, is not introduced into
								large societies by want and hunger, but by the most unnatural and
								violent spirit of revenge, and must after some time be laid aside as
								a custom which is inconsistent with itself. In order to judge of the
								happiness of mankind, it is necessary to define the various kinds of
								happiness they are capable of, in regard to their different
								faculties and state. The most pressing wants which are to be
								satisfied first, are food, habitation, and raiment; and an easy
								method of procuring them, together with the advantage of being free
								from bodily pain, is the first principle of physical happiness. The
								means of improving the intellectual faculties, and of preserving the
								rights and privileges of a free agency in man, without interfering
								with the happiness of others, form the principles of moral
								happiness. The advantages arising from the union of men in society,
								and a certain undisturbed enjoyment of physical and moral happiness,
								in conjunction with others, form the principles of civil or social
								felicity. Each state requires certain duties without the fulfilling
								of which, no happiness can be obtained. And the various kinds of
								happiness have likewise various degrees, in the number and variety
								of enjoyments, in their long and undisturbed duration, and in the
								influence they have upon the happiness of others. Nature alone
								promotes in some climates these various kinds and degrees of
								happiness; in some nature assisted by art, can produce these
								effects; and lastly, in others creative physical power and creative
								genius can only bring about such desirable ends. These general
								principles convince us of the various kinds and degrees of happiness
								in the various tribes visited by us in the South-Seas. The great
								increase of population in an isle of some size, made it necessary to
								unite into societies for mutual defence and assistance, and gave
								rise to the formation of property, and exerted cultivation. This
								required laws and regulations, and persons who should superintend
								their execution; anarchy reigns among the barbarous tribes, and
								despotism takes place among those which are more civilized and
								nearer related to Eastern despotic countries. Cultivation enables
								mankind best to enjoy the highest degree of happiness, and it is
								therefore preferable to the rambling state of shepherd nations, or
								what is still worse, the wild tribes that live by fishing and
								hunting. Men in society advance towards perfection by a strict
								regard to truth or candour, by humanity, and by perfecting their
								moral ideas and moral sense, of which various examples are produced
								among the inhabitants of the South Sea. The characteristic actions
								of people, form their manners, which accordingly are described in
								the nations we saw, together with the refinements in their manners,
								and even their luxury, with some account of the probable origin and
								progress of their Arreeoys. The situation of the fair sex in the
								various tribes we saw, is represented; they are slaves and drudges
								among the savages and barbarians, but upon a greater equality with
								the males in Taheitee, and the isles occupied by the fair race of
								men in the South-Sea. Marriage is kept sacred among all those
								nations whom we found to be monogamous. At the same time that we
								mentioned various instances of Polygyny, of which the consequence
								seems to be a greater proportion of women born, we endeavoured to
								point out the most probable cause of Polyandry now perhaps existing
								at Easter-island. The young women at Taheitee, before marriage, are
								under no restriction; but chastity after puberty and marriage, is
								highly honourable. The advantages of education consist chiefly in
								perpetuating the joint stock of knowledge of our fore-fathers, and
								making occasional additions. In Europe, this knowledge is
								sub-divided into various branches, and cannot now be lost, because
								the art of printing, so happily discovered, is so universally
								practised. But the islanders are constrained to teach their
								mechanical arts, especially such as are necessary for procuring
								food, and constructing their habitations, to every individual from
								the Prince to the slave. Historical records they have none, if we
								except a few verses made occasionally to perpetuate the names and
								actions of some individuals. They are acquainted with the polite
								arts of music, dancing, and poetry, of which a few outlines are
								given, particularly of their extemporaneous verses and drama. In
								describing the progress they have made in the art of medicine, we
								took occasion to mention the diseases of the country, especially the
								leprosy and the venereal disease, and made some observations on the
								latter. Geography, astronomy, and navigation, are in some measure
								understood among them, in confirmation of which the isles are
								described, and our readers referred to a map, drawn according to the
								informations given by Tupaya; their hours, days of the moon, and the
								number and names of the moon in their year, are enumerated together
								with those of the cardinal points, and of some stars. To their
								education likewise belong the ideas relative to the Deity and
								religion. Their system of polytheism is explained, and the names and
								functions of their gods and geniuses enumerated, their mode of
								worshipping described, their ideas on the subject of the origin of
								the world and its isles, as well as of mankind in general, and on
								their state after death, together with the various rites and
								ceremonies at birth, marriage and death, are particularly laid open
								and described. This general view of the history of these islanders,
								enables us to form a judgment on their real happiness; which is by
								no means equal among all the nations we visited in the course of our
								voyage, but it progressively varied from the wretched existence of
								the poor Pesserais to that of the unsettled life of the people in
								the Southern island of New-Zeeland; to the more comfortable
								situation of the tribes in the Northern isle, where the cultivation
								of ground has taken place with many regulations for securing their
								societies against the power and oppression of their neighbours; to
								the still more happy state of the natives of New-Caledonia and the
								New-Hebrides, where they depend still more on cultivation, and seem
								to be less ferocious; to that of the inhabitants of the
								Friendly-isles, where cultivation flourishes in the most perfect
								manner, but under the disadvantage of despotism, from their chiefs
								and their kind, or Latoo-nipo•roo; to the more increased felicity in
								the Marquesa-islands, where cultivation is well understood, but not
								in so high a degree as at the Friendly-isles, though their
								government is upon a more liberal plan; and at last to the degree of
								happiness which undoubtedly is highest among all the isles of the
								South-Sea, at Taheitee, where the mildness of the climate, and of
								government, concur with the greater extent and fertility of the
								island, the gentle temper of the inhabitants, and their courteous
								manners and improved minds, to increase their happiness, and make it
								most conspicuous and lasting.</p><p n="656">The first view will convince the unprejudiced observer, of the great
								happiness which reigns at O-Taheitee and the Society-isles. All the
								inhabitants are of an agreeable temper, and lovers of mirth and joy;
								I never saw any one, of a morose, peevish, discontented disposition
								in the whole nation; they all join to their chearful temper, a
								politeness and elegance which is happily blended with the most
								innocent simplicity of manners. Their youth shews indeed a great
								deal of levity, which with a maturer age, ripens into a more placid
								countenance and behaviour; and experience, together with their good
								natural parts endow them with true prudence and solidity for their
								conduct in life.</p><p n="657">They are possessed either of land as their own property, or enjoy a
								sufficient share of fruits and roots in lieu of the cultivation of
								the lands belonging to their chiefs, to whom they give likewise a
								share of these productions. The great fertility and mildness of the
								climate, reduce the number of their wants, and at the same time
								afford them after a very moderate labour, a great affluence of food
								and raiment, and very neat habitations, well adapted to the climate.
								The pampered epicure in Europe knows hardly the multifarious
								ingredients of his disguised ragouts, and his palled appetite
								remains indifferent to the almost infinite variety carried to his
								table from every quarter of the globe; nor has he the satisfaction
								to know how or where these things are produced, or manufactured,
								while the more happy inhabitant of Taheitee plants his own
								breadfruit tree, and plucks the fruit for his own use; the banana
								tree raises by his industry and care, its elegant stem, its
								picturesque leaves, and the delicious fruit all in one year; the
								yam, the eddo, the tacca and many other roots are the produce of the
								soil cultivated by his own hands: he catches the fish for his
								dinner, his wife rears and feeds the dog, the hog, and the fowl,
								which on great occasions serve for his meal; in short, there is not
								a single article of his food, which owes not its existence to his or
								his fathers industry or care; who planted the trees, which furnish
								cocoas, apples, and other nuts and fruits. In regard to clothes, the
								Taheitean is most certainly happier than the European, whose dress
								requires more time, labour, and devices; and to whom folly and
								fashion have made many articles seem to be necessary, which are
								really frivolous and absolutely useless; the Taheitean dress is
								easier obtained and made; elegant, simple, and answering every
								purpose in their situation. Their houses are neat and well suited to
								the climate, and the manners of the nation; I pretend not here to
								say that these three great articles, food, raiment, and habitation,
								are in every respect at Taheitee, superior to our food, our dresses,
								our materials, and houses; it must be allowed these articles are
								among us, more ingeniously contrived and varied, and better adapted
								to all seasons, climates, and ranks; but it cannot be denied that
								these people enjoy a happiness which is more attainable by every
								individual, for there cannot be an instance among them, that ever a
								person died for want of shelter, cloth, or food; even the meanest
								obtain their share with great ease and in affluence; none is doomed
								by a hard master to perpetual toils and unremitted labour, which
								requires a continual exertion of all his strength: for the natives
								work gently, and more for the sake of exercise, than to obtain their
								livelihood by it. The fertility of the country enables them to
								satisfy their little wants, and to form societies, where they can
								mutually assist one another, both by their labour and by the
								instruction and knowledge, which willingly flows from the lips of
								their wise men and fathers; they hear the noble actions of their
								ancestors celebrated by songs, and consecrated by the gratitude of
								posterity; their minds therefore are early devoted to candour and
								humanity, to truth and to virtue; their societies are well
								regulated; their chiefs have a great love and paternal predilection
								for the happiness and welfare of their subjects, who, in their turn,
								are attached to their superiors by love and a truly filial duty. The
								vices which are usual among them, are yet so few in number, and of
								so harmless a tendency that few societies can boast such innocence,
								and simplicity of manners. Every individual is convinced that the
								chiefs can have nothing in view in the administration of affairs,
								but the happiness of the whole community, and the satisfaction and
								contentment of every individual, and this they prove in return by
								that exemplary love, attachment, respect and obedience, which they
								chearfully shew to their chiefs. While the youth of both sexes was
								singing and dancing, and those of a maturer age, active as well in
								their duties as enjoyments, we have often seen the venerable hoary
								senior looking upon the more busy scenes of life with a complacent
								smile and a serenity, which bore witness to the happiness enjoyed by
								all ranks and ages: in a word we are perfectly convinced that these
								islanders really enjoy a degree of felicity, which is seldom
								observed in the more civilized countries, and which is here still
								more enhanced by the generality with which it is diffused over whole
								nations, by the facility with which it is attainable, and by the
								just proportion it bears to the present state of these islanders, to
								whose condition this happiness is perfectly adequate, and which if
								enlarged would become incompatible with their capacities.</p><p n="658">We have now and then illustrated in notes the customs of the natives
								in these islands, and represented some of them to be similar to
								customs which formerly did, or at present still prevail among other
								nations very distant from those we had seen; but we have also
								collected more of these parallel customs; not always with a view to
								prove that nations, which chance to have the same custom, owe their
								origin to one another; but rather to convince ourselves that this
								similarity does not always give sufficient foundation for such a
								belief. At the same time we may suspect, that some of these customs
								were really common to two nations, on account of their common
								origin.</p><p n="659">The custom of cutting or puncturing the body with instruments dipped
								in a mixture of water and lamp-black, and forming thereby various

								imprinted indelible figures all over the body, as at the Marquesas;
								some produced only large blotches on the buttocks, which is chiefly
								customary at the Society-isles and Taheitee; others again have only
								a few black or blue spots on their lips, which is the custom of the
								women at New-Zeeland. Strange as this custom seems to be, it has
								been however received among many nations; the Tunguses,*<ref target="#jf207"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf207">* Gmelin's Voyage to Sibiria, vol. i. p. 77, and vol. ii. p. 648, &amp;amp;c. &amp;amp;c.</note></ref> and the

								to be the reason which prompted the New-Zeelanders to cut various
								deep figures and scrolls into their faces, but rather that of the
								very obvious ones to making their aspect more terrible to their
								enemies, and inuring the young men to endure pain; it has however,
								in the course of nature, produced the same effect, and almost
								eradicated the hair of the beard. In all America the savages are
								used to puncture some part of the body with black figures. Pietro
								della Valle observed the Arabians had likewise adopted this custom.
								The women of the Bedouins of the desarts about Tunis and Tremesen
								punctured their lips according to the testimony of Boullaye le Gouz.
								The Arabian women in Palestine used the same custom as D'Arvieux and
								de la Roque have observed. Besides these black carved scrolls on the
								faces of the New-Zeelanders, we frequently observed perpendicular
								deep furrows marked on their foreheads; these however were cut in
								the phrenzy of their grief, with a sharp shell, for the loss of a
								friend or near relation. The O-Taheitean women wound the crown of
								the head under the hair with a shark's tooth, to prove the sincerity
								of their grief: and the antient Huns wounded their cheeks on all

								their hands, and threw it on their heads; and when we landed, they

Cook's Voyages and those of George Forster.</note></ref></p><p n="671">The inhabitants of the island of Ulee (one of the Caroline-islands)
								and its district, are of various colours, some are fairer than the
								rest, like Mestisos, who have a Spanish father and an Indian mother;
								others are similar in colour to the Indians at the Philippines; and
								others again are like mulattoes sprung from a negro and an Indian
								woman. The most tawny people are of the lowest class, and serve
								instead of domestics. They all live chiefly upon fish, which they
								catch in great abundance, upon cocos and seven sorts of roots,
								similar to those used in the Marian-islands. They have fowls, and
								catch all kinds of birds especially of the aquatic sort, which they
								use for food; but they are without any quadruped. The houses of the
								common people are small cottages covered with thatch of a kind of
								palm leaves (probably the Athrodactylis) but those of their chiefs
								or Tamoles are large, painted, and ornamented on the inside. Their
								boats are high both before and behind, and the plans are sewed
								together; to one side of the boat out-riggers are fixed, which are
								also fastened to a long spar placed parallel to the boat to prevent
								its oversetting: at the prow and poop, and likewise at each end of
								an out-rigger, projecting from each side of the mast, are small
								apartments; the sails are manufactured of a mat of palm leaves.</p><p n="672">The common occupation of men consists in preparing the soil for the
								cultivation of various roots for their subsistence; for which
								purpose they clear the ground of the woods with their
								stone-hatchets, in a very troublesome manner, and then set fire to
								the wood when perfectly dry; the smoak and fire of which is often
								seen at a great distance out at sea. Fishing takes up a great deal
								of their time, and they use for that purpose among other
								contrivances, a basket. The building houses and boats together with
								the making their arms, are likewise allotted to the men. The women
								assist the men in sewing and planting their roots, and are besides
								occupied in dressing their victuals, and preparing cloth from the
								bark of a plane-tree.*<ref target="#jf240"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf240">* The plane-tree here mentioned is most probably the Morus papyrifera, since its jagged leaves might be mistaken for those of a plane-tree.</note></ref> The tree called by them balibago is likewise
								employed in the manufacture of cloth by their women.</p><p n="673">In their domestic life they are very sober and uniform; they rise
								with the sun, and go to sleep when it sets. For their meals they
								keep no regular time, but eat whenever appetite prompts them, and
								whenever opportunity offers: However they eat but little at a time,
								and repeat it often. They bathe three times a day, and are always
								very neat and cleanly. Their king or great chief resides in the isle
								of Ulee, and another lives in that of Lamurec, and all the chiefs or
								Tamoles of the neighbouring isles are subjects or vassals of these
								two kings. Each island contains a great many noblemen or Tamoles of
								the royal family and one of them governs the isle. A kind of gentry
								inferior in rank are next to the Tamoles, and the low people are
								still more subjected; each of these ranks of men shew great respect
								to their chiefs.</p><p n="674">Those who are willing to pay a visit to their chiefs, shew their
								respect amongst others by painting their bodies with a kind of an
								aromatic yellow paste;**<ref target="#jf241"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf241">** In the Friendly isles, Easter Island, and all the New Hebrides, they slain their bodies and cloth sometimes with a yellow aromatic powder, extracted from turmeric.</note></ref> this is likewise observed on their
								festivals; but the chiefs are almost constantly painted in this
								manner. The raiment of the common people consists of a piece of
								cloth wrapped round their loins and thighs, part of which passes
								between their legs. The women are dressed in the same manner, with
								this difference only, that the cloth reaches down to the middle of
								their legs, whereas that of the men hardly covers the knees. The
								upper part of the body is naked; however sometimes a kind of cloak
								with a hood to it is worn by them over their shoulders. The chief
								wears a piece of cloth with a hole cut in the middle of it, through
								which he puts the head, and has one part hanging down the breast and
								to the knees, and the other reaching as far down behind. The women
								wear bracelets of tortoise-shell above their elbows, and in their
								ears, rings made of the same substance, in which they sometimes put
								odoriferous flowers, or small beads of coco-nut-shells. The men use
								a kind of cap or fillet, made of plaited filaments, stuck round with
								birds feathers standing upright. Their body is marked with various
								lines dispersed in various compartments, but the women and children
								are without them. They are a set of people having well-proportioned
								limbs, but their chiefs are remarkably tall and lusty, their hair is
								black, long, and falling in curls; their beards are strong and
								bushy, their noses broad, their eyes large, lively and piercing. In
								their temper is a mixture of the greatest good-nature and
								benevolence; therefore if ever they quarrel, they are never carried
								away so far by their passion or hatred as to kill their adversary:
								the highest pitch of their vengeance is to fight their foes at fisty
								cuffs, and as soon as some of the by-standers interfere and separate
								the combatants, their anger is over and they are easily reconciled,
								especially by a few presents made to the person offended. If ever
								any one commits a heinous crime, his punishment never extends
								further than banishment to one of the neighbouring islands. Though
								the breach of conjugal fidelity is reckoned a great crime, it is
								however deemed venial, and the injured husband easily forgets the
								offence for a handsome acknowledgement: but he is still at liberty
								to divorce the wife upon such occasions. The wife is likewise
								permitted to separate herself from her husband upon any slight
								offence, displeasure or disgust. One curious custom however prevails
								among them, according to which a man marries the wife of his
								deceased brother, in case he has left no children to inherit; this
								custom, as far as we know, is no where practised among the
								inhabitants of the islands which we had occasion to visit. The
								common people are contented with one wife, though it be not unlawful
								to marry more than one, and with the chiefs and nobles it is looked
								upon as a mark of rank to have more than one wife; nay, the King of
								the district of Cittac residing at the isle of Huogoleu or Torres,
								has nine wives. Among themselves they keep strictly honest, and
								pilfer only from strangers; they covet iron above all things, and
								every one who obtains some, either by purchase from Europeans, from
								shipwrecks, or by stealth, is obliged to bring it to the chief, who
								orders such tools to be made of it, as the size and form of the iron
								will best admit, and then his subjects hire them for their own use
								at a certain price.</p><p n="675">Their benevolent and friendly disposition gives unity and friendship
								to their societies; their lively and joyful temper prompts them to
								mirth and all kinds of sports, and the enjoyment of pleasure; they
								are amazingly addicted to laughing, and are fond of little witty
								agreeable stories of a jovial turn; they shew true politeness and
								good breeding in all their manners and behaviour, and speak very
								pertinently and wisely on all kinds of subjects; their hearts are
								capable of being melted at the recital or sight of distress or
								wretchedness, and a generous tear never fails to steal down their
								cheeks, the tribute of benevolence and humanity. In their social and
								festal meetings, they have much singing and dancing. Their females
								often sit down in small companies, and sing languishing songs,
								accompanied by motions of the head and hands expressive of the same
								sentiment, these they call Tanger ifaifil,*<ref target="#jf242"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf242">* We have already made use of this word, to render our opinion more probable; according to which the nations of the first race of people in the South Seas are descended from the inhabitants of the Caroline Islands. See p. 400.</note></ref> or the complaint of
								women. Their songs are not without a regular measure and harmony,
								and they beat time by striking their thighs. In their dances the men
								stand in two lines opposite to one another; their heads are stuck
								with feathers and flowers, odoriferous herbs hang from their noses,
								and from the ears hang down ornaments made of plaited coco-nut
								filaments. The dances consist chiefly in cadenced, harmonic, and
								uniform motions of the head, arms, hands, and feet. The chief
								sometimes holds up a piece of cloth, which is given to him who first
								can seize it, all the competitors starting at the same time for
								it.</p><p n="676">In case they should be injured by neighbouring societies or tribes,
								they avenge their wrongs by war. They chiefly use lances and darts
								for arms, which are barbed with points of human bones, and
								constantly exercise themselves in throwing lances and stones at a
								mark. They march up regularly in three lines, the first consisting
								of young men, the second those of a middle age, and lastly the old
								men stand behind, and no sooner is one of the first rank killed,
								than the man behind occupies the empty place. They have no defensive
								weapons, but endeavour to avoid the missile arms of the enemy by
								agility: their wars are by no means bloody and cruel; the death of
								two or three men commonly decides the victory, and the conquerors
								announce their conquest by a loud triumphant shout, and insulting
								words against the routed party.</p><p n="677">They have an idea of the immortality of the soul, and of a state
								wherein the good are rewarded and the wicked punished. When common
								people die, their corpses are thrown into the sea. But the bodies of
								their deceased chiefs are painted yellow; the assembled people cut
								locks of their hair and beards, and throw them on the corpse in
								testimony of their grief, to which they add in loud vociferation the
								praises of the dead, and lastly abstain all that day from eating.
								After this ceremony the corpse of the deceased is inclosed in a
								small stone apartment in their own houses, or buried at some
								distance from their habitations and the sepulcre inclosed in a
								stone-wall. From time to time they expose near the grave fruits and
								other eatables, that according to their opinion the deceased may
								suck them: for they suppose the souls of those who are gone to
								heaven, return on the fourth day and live invisibly among their
								friends and relations. These souls are looked upon as good genii,
								and in every undertaking they are addressed for assistance and
								success, the priests being supposed to have an intercourse with
								them.</p><p n="678">These and many other traditional doctrines are communicated by
								certain teachers to the youth of both sexes, in houses appropriated
								for that purpose. The boys especially learn the names and directions
								of the 12 winds of their compass, the names and motion of the
								brightest stars; the situation and names of the various neighbouring
								isles, and by what course they must steer for each of them. The
								teachers likewise communicate to them their traditional doctrines of
								religion. It is observed that though they have no knowledge of a
								maker of Heaven and Earth, they however acknowledge a good and great
								spirit, who is the great Lord of Heaven, to whom many spirits both
								good and evil are subordinate: these spirits are celestial beings
								different from those who inhabit the Earth, they have a body, and
								marry in the style of their chiefs, more than one wife. The oldest
								spirit known among them is called Sabucoor, and his wife's name is
								Halmelul. Their son was Eliulep, (i.e. the great spirit) and their
								daughter Ligobuud. Eliulep married Leteuhieul, a woman born in the
								island of Ulee, and had by her a son called Lugueiling, (i.e. middle
								of heaven) whom these nations worship as the great lord of heaven,
								of which he is presumptive heir: Leteuhieul died in the prime of her
								youth and her spirit flew to heaven. Eliulep adopted a young man,
								born in the island of Lamurec, called Reschahuileng, who, being
								tired with living on earth, ascended to heaven, in order to enjoy
								the delights of his father: his mother being still alive at Lamurec,
								he came to her into the middle region of the air and communicated to
								her the mysteries of heaven. The sister of Eliulep, called Ligobuud,
								finding herself with child in the middle region of the air, came
								down to earth, and brought forth three children. She was astonished
								to find the earth to be barren and dry; by her powerful word the
								earth was covered with herbs, flowers, and fruit-trees; she covered
								the earth with verdure, and peopled it with reasonable men. No death
								then took place on earth, for in lieu of it a short sleep befel the
								men the last day of the moon, who revived at her re-apparition on
								the horizon, as if awaking from an agreeable slumber. But
								Erigerigers, an evil spirit, who was displeased with the happiness
								of mankind, brought about a kind of death, against which there is no
								remedy, and since that time, he who dies once is certainly dead:
								this evil genius is called Elus melabut, (i.e. malevolent spirit):
								the rest are called Elus melasirs (benevolent spirits). Morogrog, an
								evil spirit, expelled from heaven, brought fire first upon earth.
								Lugueiling, the son of Eliulep, married two wives, one of celestial
								origin, who brought him two children, Carrer and Meliliau; the other
								of terrestrial origin, born at Falalu, in the province of Huogoleu,
								by whom he had a son, called Oclesat; this young man, upon hearing
								that his father was a celestial spirit, attempted to mount to
								heaven, but fell down and wept: hereupon he kindled a great fire,
								and went up in the smoke to his celestial father, whom he embraced.
								In the isle of Falalu is a pond of fresh water, which the natives
								fear to approach, because they suppose the Gods bathe in it. The
								sun, the moon, and the stars, have, according to the opinion of
								these people, rational souls, and are inhabited by numerous
								celestial nations. These islanders have neither temples, nor carved
								or any other images; and they never think it necessary to make any
								offerings or sacrifices, except a few of them, who seem to worship
								their deceased friends. At the island of Yap or Panlog, the
								inhabitants worship a crocodile; observe incantations making knots
								of palm-leaves. And to the East of the five clusters of isles,
								called Carolines, there are many more islands, especially that of
								Falupet, the inhabitants of which worship the shark, (Tiburon).</p><p n="679">These isles are very numerous, and have inhabitants of a brown
								colour, like those of the coast of Philippines; but the inhabitants
								of Panleu or the Palaos, are like negroes, savage and barbarous;
								they go naked, and are canibals; and are for that reason, detested
								by the inhabitants of the Caroline-islands, who look upon them as
								dangerous to deal with, and the fiends of mankind.</p><p n="680">The chiefs at the Caroline-islands are much respected; they wear long
								beards, and sit on a high seat, like a table, and give audience;
								those who want to talk to a chief, bow very low, then sit down, hear
								his commands, and go away after another bow, or they sometimes kiss
								his hands and feet; or they take the foot of the chief gently with
								the hand, and rub their face with it. They think it likewise a mark
								of respect to lull the Tanaoles asleep by songs.</p><p n="681">These few remarks on the manners, customs, opinions, and religion of
								the natives in the Caroline-islands, if compared with those of the
								inhabitants of the South Sea isles, of the first race, prove that
								they bear a strong resemblance; and as this similarity of almost
								every circumstance can hardly be accidental, especially if we
								consider the vicinity of both clusters of isles, and the
								correspondence in the stature, colour, habit of body, and turn of
								mind of the inhabitants, and the probable successive migration of
								these tribes from isle to isle; it is almost beyond a doubt, that
								they are very nearly related to one another; and that from these
								Caroline-islanders, the inhabitants of the Eastern South Sea islands
								were descended at some distant period. This consideration leads us
								to another, viz. that these islanders having no other than vague
								traditional reports in lieu of historical records, it is impossible
								to know any thing of their origin or migrations; and that no distant
								guess or conjecture could ever have been formed unless by paying a
								particular attention to their peculiar customs and manners, and
								likewise to their language; of the first we have given as good an
								account as our historical proofs would admit; the latter some future
								navigators must investigate more carefully. A stronger proof of the
								advantages of civilization, cannot be given, than results from this
								total uncertainty, respecting the origin of these nations: if we
								have been able to produce any arguments that lay claim to
								probability, it is because our minds are improved by civilization,
								and our talents, natural and acquired, have enabled us to form a
								judgment as nearly approaching to truth as these subjects will
								allow. Our minds therefore should be impressed with the most
								unfeigned feelings and acts of gratitude to Providence for the
								blessings of a more exalted civilization and education, which give
								us in every respect so great a superiority over these nations, and
								assign to us so high a rank in the scale of rational beings; and how
								much ought not this to encourage us to act up to this greater
								knowledge, and to maintain by humanity and virtue the exalted
								station we occupy.</p><p n="682"><q><emph>Quum natura hominis imbecillior sit, quam caeterorum

								the Cape of Good Hope, the history of the first long navigations,
								abounds with the most melancholy accounts of a dreadful and alarming
								mortality raging on board the vessels. Death, in its multifarious
								and terrible approaching symptoms, without remedy, though none of
								the least sources of human misery, is, however, exceeded by the loss
								of thousands of young, hale, and very useful sea-faring men, who, in
								a great commercial state are an irreparable loss, and must become
								alarming to the state, either during the time of or on the eve of a
								war. The mortality was felt again on certain occasions in later
								times; and the principles both of sound policy as well as of
								humanity, should prompt every man of knowledge, and who has an
								opportunity of making observations on this great and interesting
								subject, to communicate his observations to the public, together
								with his proposals for the preservation of so useful a set of men as
								mariners are; that those who are intrusted with the conduct of naval
								affairs, may have an opportunity of trying these proposed remedies
								and prophylactics, and upon finding that some answer and others do
								not, the public may be enabled to profit by their experience, and
								thus preserve the lives of many thousands of useful members to
								society. It has been frequently the practice of the great officers
								for naval affairs in the various commercial nations, not only to
								recommend many of these things by way of experiment, but likewise to
								encourage those by rewards, who had the good fortune or skill to
								discover some new method of preventing in any manner the premature
								loss of mariners by diseases, especially those of the putrid kind.
								But none of the maritime powers can boast so many essays, and so
								many successful attempts for saving the lives of mariners as Great
								Britain.</p><p n="684">The legislative and executive branches of government, together with
								all the public learned bodies, as well as individuals, concurred in
								this noble and benevolent career. The last voyages undertaken under
								the royal patronage, planned by wisdom, supported by national
								munificence, and executed with the most indefatigable labour, and a
								noble exertion of knowledge, experience, and perseverance, are the
								most undeniable proofs of this spirit of emulation, in this
								important business to mankind. In consequence of it, that great and
								able navigator, Captain Cook, has communicated to the world the
								method he employed for the preservation of the healths and lives of
								his ship's company, and its success. The Royal Society has crowned
								his paper with the presentation of Sir Godfrey Copley's golden
								medal, to testify her approbation of the excellent method proposed
								by him. The learned president of the Society, has, upon this
								occasion, illustrated the method used by the navigator, with that
								perspicuity, learning, experience, and both medical and natural
								knowledge, which are peculiar to him, and have procured him the
								merited applause of the learned world. After these publications it
								might seem superfluous, to say any thing more on a subject so ably
								set forth: however, as I have had frequent opportunities of
								investigating this subject with care and attention, and can give
								some necessary details on the preparation and use of the
								antiseptics; and lastly, as I flatter myself not only to be able to
								propose some material improvements on many parts of this method, but
								also to suggest some important hints, which may lead to still
								greater discoveries; I thought it on the present occasion by no
								means superfluous to publish my observations and remarks on ths same
								subject, hoping that they may in course of time become useful and
								interesting. I am besides so well persuaded of the candour, humanity
								and zeal for encouraging every attempt which tends to improve
								science, and to promote the benefit of mankind both in my friend
								Capt. Cook and in the learned president of the Royal Society, that I
								have not the least doubt of being not only absolved by them, of the
								charge of envy or a desire of rivalship in the same career, but
								likewise of being commended for being emulous of becoming useful to
								mankind and perhaps the occasion of saving the lives of many useful
								and necessary members of society.</p><p n="685">The most common and at the same time most dreadful evil infesting the
								crews of ships sent out on long voyages, is the Sea-Scurvy; which
								according to the last observations of Dr. Macbride, and those of Sir
								John Pringle is of the putrid kind. Some authors have assigned the
								sea-air to be one of its causes, but it is impossible to make good
								this assertion, since people living near the sea, or in small
								islands surrounded by the sea and its air, enjoy their health as
								well as those who have inland habitations. Salt provisions
								contribute no doubt a great deal towards spreading this disease in a
								ship, especially if they have been lying for a long space of time in
								salt and are become putrid; as this must accelerate its symptoms and
								bring on a general putrescence of the whole habit of the human body.
								But the chief causes, originally depositing the fomes3 of
								putrescence into our body, have in my opinion, hitherto not been
								attended to, and still less have they been placed in that point of
								view, in which I flatter myself to represent it to the public; and
								which I trust may lead us to find out the remedies against this
								dreadful scourge to sea-faring people.</p><p n="686">We find that the blood of animals imbibes through the lungs a
								considerable portion of phlogistic matter; for when a quantity of
								inflammable air made by pouring some weakened oil of vitriol on
								steel filings, contained in a bladder or vessel, is breathed into
								the lungs and exhaled again into the same vessel, it not only after
								20 or 30 reciprocal breathings ceases to be inflammable, but on the
								contrary will extinguish a burning candle put into it; which
								circumstance incontestibly proves, that the inflammable air, when in
								the lungs had been deprived of its phlogiston, and consequently that
								the latter had been absorbed into the blood. That ingenious and
								accurate philosopher, Dr. Priestley, inferred from the experiment
								wherein common air becomes, by being inhaled into the lungs unfit
								for the purposes of respiration or giving nourishment to the flame
								of a candle, "that the use of the lungs is to carry off a putrid
								effluvium, or to discharge that phlogiston,4 which had been taken
								into the system with the aliment, and was become, as it were,
								effete; the air that is respired serving as a menstruum for that
								purpose."*<ref target="#jf243"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf243">* Experiments and Observations on different kinds of air, by Joseph Priestley, L.L.D. vol. iii. p. 56. In the Philos. Trans. vol. lxi. P. i. p. 226.</note></ref> And adds, that what he had before "concluded to be the
								use of respiration in general, he had now, he thinks proved to be
								effected by means of the blood, in consequence of its coming so
								nearly into contact with the air in the lungs: the blood appearing
								to be a fluid wonderfully formed to imbibe and part with that
								principle, which the chemists call phlogiston." It appears however
								from the experiment just mentioned, and which may easily be
								repeated, that the blood instead of discharging any phlogiston,
								imbibes it only from the air, and at each inhalation decompounds the
								common air,=<ref target="#jf244"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf244">= Dr. Priestley had no doubt left in his mind, that atmospherical air consists of the nitrous acid and earth: Priestley, vol. ii. p. 35.

The word Ether has been adopted in chemistry from the notions of antient Philosophers, who called the substance they supposed to exist beyond our atmosphere by that name: and in the same manner the more refined and purer regions beyond the atmosphere were called by the antients the Empyreal Heavens. It will therefore be no impropriety to call this integrant part of common air, Empyreal air.</note></ref> (i.e.

								proved to be compounded of a very subtle acid and a phlogiston.
								Consequently in every inhalation, the common air yields to the blood
								its empyreal part, which contains a good deal of phlogiston, and
								leaves the rest unfit for respiration. The empyreal air acts as an
								other, or dulcified acid upon the lungs and the heart, and
								consequently as a gentle stimulus. Were the acid too prevalent in
								its composition, it would cause convulsions, and too much phlogiston
								would likewise be hurtful, as we shall shew in the sequel. The
								dulcified acid or ethereal air is therefore found the most
								convenient. All the operations of our body are produced either by
								chemical processes or by mechanical powers, or both. The empyreal
								air, on account of its dulcified acid, stimulates the heart, and
								causes its continual motion, and on account of its phlogiston
								entertains and diffuses that natural heat, which is absolutely
								necessary for the functions of life.</p><p n="687">All organic bodies both animal and vegetable consist of an acid, some
								phlogiston and absorbent earth. The proportions of the integrant
								parts vary, and are sometimes modified by additions of some other
								substances. The addition of food and the attraction of juices by the
								roots, are the means of increasing the growth and supporting the
								life both of vegetables and animals. All animal bodies require a
								continual supply of food, from whence both by a chemical and
								mechanical operation juices are extracted; which are assimilated as
								much as possible to those continued in the body, and rendered nearly
								homogeneous to its constituent parts; these juices circulate in the
								form of blood through the body, and gradually form a secretion of
								various parts, constantly depositing insensible atoms of matter,
								replacing continually those atoms which are incessantly wasted by
								perspiration, and friction, by labour, walking, &amp;c. These atoms
								deposited by the blood and other juices are analogous to the
								mixtures contained in the various substances employed as food; if
								therefore the acid particles prevail in the nourishment, it is an
								acidulated diet; if the phlogiston is most copious, it yields a
								phlogistic diet, and if the absorbents and alkalies preponderate it
								becomes an alkaline diet. Health depends partly on the just medium
								or mixture between the various diets: for according as the quality
								of the diet prevails in the food, so must the juices be changed
								which are circulating in the body, and which afterwards constitute
								the solids. If the acids prevail, the fibres of the body become too
								crisp and much inclined to convulsive symptoms; if the phlogiston
								becomes too copious, inflammatory and eruptive diseases may be
								apprehended, and if the alkaline parts are the chief ingredients of
								our food, putrid diseases must be the natural consequences. I wish
								to be understood, without misconstruction; I pretend not to say that
								an acidulated diet is the only cause of convulsive and spasmodic
								symptoms, or the phlogistic of inflammatory diseases, or the
								alkaline of putrid: for there are no doubt many other causes
								productive of the same effects, under various circumstances; nay,
								there are external causes which throw the whole habit into the same
								morbific state that may originate from a certain kind of food.</p><p n="688">Fresh food, both of the animal and vegetable kind, contains a
								proportionate salubrious mixture of acids, phlogiston and alkalies;
								especially if it be dressed without any disguise of rich sauces,
								full of spice and other ingredients, not properly assimilated to our
								habits; it is therefore no wonder, that caeteribus paribus, fresh
								food is not so pernicious as salted. But if we examine the water,
								the flesh, and all the aliments eaten by the people in ships during
								long voyages; we find that they have left that equal mixture of
								parts, which alone entitled them to the rank of salubrious food. The
								water, if ever so good when fresh, commonly in a few weeks stinks
								intolerably, especially in hot climates, and is often full of
								aquatic insects, and in case those insects perish in the water, they
								putrefy, that is, their organic parts are again restored to a
								mixture of their integrant elementary parts; and they form commonly
								a real liver of sulphur,*<ref target="#jf247"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf247">* Mr. Sage Analyse des bl‚s, Paris, 1776, 8vo. p. 106, seq.</note></ref> whose noxiousness and septic quality is
								well known. The flesh is salted in order to preserve it the longer;
								but common salt is by no means an antiseptic, when mixed with animal
								substances. The latter when dead, by an intestine motion of their
								elementary integrant parts are gradually dissolved; the volatile
								parts of phlogiston, and acids volatilized by phlogiston fly off;
								then the volatile alkaline parts leave the mass; and the remainder
								is a magma, nearly related to a hepar sulphuris; which after a stiff
								longer period of time becomes an alkali, or an absorbent earth. The
								addition of the large quantity of salt cannot prevent the flesh from
								real putrefaction, but only retards its progress. We found, that our
								meat, which had been really the best of its kind, was become in fact
								very little better than putrid; all its fat had been corroded by the
								salt, and its smell, both in a raw and boiled state, was extremely
								offensive, though it had been towed in a net of ropes for
								twenty-four hours at the stern of the ship; by which operation a
								great proportion of the saltness, together with part of the stench
								had been carried off, and the bare tough muscular fibre strongly
								impregnated with salt alone remained. The gelatinous part, which is
								the chief nutriment in flesh, was all lost, and nothing was left but
								a strongly alkaline part, which is known to be a great promoter of
								putrefaction. The bread is made for the English navy of wheat, and
								is baked into flat cakes, without the addition of yeast or other
								leaves. The flatness of the bread is the means of excluding
								moisture, which would otherwise be expelled by fire. It is
								impossible to preserve the bread against the attacks of weavils,
								which exist by thousands in it. In their larva or grub state they
								pierce bread very much, and in their perfect insect state they
								deposit their eggs in it. If unfortunately the casks containing the
								bread have not been well seasoned before, or are still green, the
								bread grows mouldy, contracts a musty taste and smell, and becomes
								really rotten. If the casks be good, they are still subject to the
								alkaline and septic effluvia of the putrid water, in the casks and
								flesh, or those from the bilge-water, and the bad air caused by the
								breathing and perspiration of many hundred persons, which penetrates
								to the best secured and most secret places, and infects every thing
								with its septic quality. I need not mention that in some few cases
								the sea-water may reach the bread-casks, which naturally must spoil
								them, and woe to the poor mortals who are under the cruel necessity
								of living upon bread affected by such an accident. It is true, all
								possible care is taken to secure this most necessary article against
								such accidents, but I have been told that sometimes they happen in
								spight of all providential care. White pease are an article of food
								daily served at dinner in the form of soup, which is, in my opinion,
								one of the best aliments that can be given in long voyages, as they
								are full of fixed air, and contain likewise a considerable portion
								of phlogiston; they are liable, by the intestinal digestive
								fermentation, to part with their fixed air, which is on sea voyages
								one of the most necessary articles that can be found in aliment. We
								had the misfortune to have on board the Resolution, pease for our
								provision, that had been, I suppose, kiln-dried; for though they
								were boiled over so long, they remained whole; the husk parted, and
								left the two halves of the pease, as hard as if they had only been
								parched. The pease on board the Adventure had not this bad quality,
								which effectually prevented the easy digestion of this excellent
								food: it is, however, of great consequence to take aliments, which
								are easily digested on long sea voyages, because many circumstances
								concur to weaken the digestive power of the stomach and intestines
								in these circumstances. Government was used to allow oil to the
								ship's company for making their puddings, and for dressing their
								victuals in such manner as the sailors like best. Captain Cook says,
								oil (such as the navy is usually supplied with) has the contrary
								effect; i.e. is not antiscorbutic, but septic. From the hint thrown
								out by this able navigator, it should seem that the navy is usually
								supplied with an oil of inferior sort, and bad quality, either
								actually rancid, or such as is on the point of becoming so. How ill
								suited oil is in such a state to health, I leave to those to judge
								who know what effects acids have upon our frame. Wheat or oatmeal
								are provided for the navy for breakfast, and are both most excellent
								aliments for men, who are deprived of fresh vegetable diet, during a
								long space of time.</p><p n="689">We have hitherto examined the food on board of such ships as are
								performing long voyages: we are next to examine the other parts of
								the oeconomy of a sailor. The great numbers of people perspiring and
								breathing in a ship, must naturally render the air between decks at
								last unfit for breathing; or at least so much charged with alkaline
								and septic effluvia, that it must be very difficult to preserve the
								health of the seamen in the midst of such a cloud of infecting
								steams; this will become more evident, by considering that the
								bilge-water in the pump-well, is more than sufficient to fill the
								whole ship with noxious effluvia. After we left Plymouth, in the
								year 1772, and gradually came into warmer climates, a most
								intolerable stench began to spread throughout the ship; the
								bilge-water having become highly putrid, and diffusing its noxious
								effluvia from the motion, continually forming and presenting new
								surfaces for the evaporation of the offensive particles. No parts
								were more infected by this smell, than my own and my son's cabins,
								because they were nearest to the main mast, and consequently close
								to the opening of the pumps from whence this horrid stench was
								communicated to the upper parts of the ship. I was then little
								acquainted with naval affairs, and communicated accidentally my
								sentiments to the Captain; he immediately supposed the bilge-water
								to be the cause, and explained to me the situation of the pump-well,
								and that all the moisture of the ship must be collected in that
								place; he added the ship had been detained for such a long space of
								time at Sheerness and Plymouth, that it was no wonder if the water
								should have become putrid: its depth was measured, and found to be a
								few inches high only, which is never thought sufficient to make it
								worth while to pump it out; the water therefore remained, and the
								stench continued for some time, till it gradually became less
								offensive: however I then recommended the use of fire and
								fumigations between decks as the best remedies against this dreadful
								stench and the noxious effluvia of this sink. I find by my journal,
								that my advice was followedl during our passage from Madeira to the
								Cape Verd Islands, anterior to the 8th of August, and that the air
								was rarefied by charcoal fires, and sometimes by setting fire to
								brimstone or pitch, or even to a mixture of gun-powder and vinegar.*<ref target="#jf248"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf248">* The friend of Capt. Cook mentioned by Sir John Pringle in his Discourse, who observed that the old twenty gun ships, had their galley or kitchen in the fore-part of the orlop,5 and suspected this circumstance to contribute much towards their being remarkably less sickly, than those ships of the same size of a modern construction, is certainly very right in his suspicion. When I was at Plymouth in the year 1772, expecting the arrival of the Resolution, Dr. Irving visited with me a Dutch man of war, then lying there: we found the kitchen in the middle part of the orlop, somewhat before the main mast, and enquiring how they found the ship in regard to healthiness, when out at sea for some time, we were told, that it was remarkably healthy. The smoak was very great and the heat in the middle of a very warm day, was to us, almost intolerable between decks.</note></ref>
								When this was done, all hands were called on deck, all the skuttles
								and hatchways were shut, and the smoak confined, so that it had time
								likewise to destroy the vermin. When this operation was done during
								winter, I generally found the thermometer in my cabin to rise, and
								to remain higher during the first twenty-four hours; the difference
								however seldom exceeded two or three degrees: for the fire was made
								between decks, and the smoak only penetrated into my cabin by the
								chinks and crevices of the deck.</p><p n="690">The next object falling under examination, are the persons themselves
								sailing in the ship, and their dress. In general we find mankind of
								the same turn of mind; among all ranks of men are such as love
								neatness of their persons and cleanliness both in regard to their
								bodies and their cloths; and likewise there are others, who from an
								invincible connate indolence or sluggishness are always dirty, and
								though they have a sufficient change they become however so
								uncleanly, that it seems almost an inherent quality to them; no
								wonder therefore, that persons of both these qualifications should
								be found in a ship's company. The same cloth constantly put on
								without any change, must very naturally imbibe a great part of the
								effluvia carried off by perspiration, and being constantly worn, the
								pores must again imbibe the impure vapours; and as the filthiness in
								their external behaviour causes them to postpone their washing, many
								pores must by this neglect be stopt up, and the insensible
								perspiration prevented. All which circumstances contribute greatly
								toward accelerating the effects of the scurvy.</p><p n="691">Let us now consider how far the aliments on board a ship can be made
								antiseptic in long voyages; for it can be no remedy against the
								scurvy to give the patients a small dose of physic; since the
								greater part of the food of a sailor is either putrid or at least in
								such a state, that it must highly promote and accelerate the
								putresence of the whole habit: it becomes therefore absolutely
								necessary to provide a substance by way of aliment, which will keep
								a long while at sea without decaying, and which will yield in
								quantity those particles, which are generally wanting in the putrid
								food. The flesh must be salted, and of course is liable to lose by
								lying long in salt those particles, which when boiled down, first
								yield a gelatinous substance, and lastly a kind of glue, the only
								nutritive parts contained in all meat; this aliment is therefore one
								of those which cannot be preserved in a good condition, be it ever
								so good in its kind, and which of course must become more and more
								noxious in proportion to the space of time it has been lying in
								salt.</p><p n="692">The bread is the second article of food, which likewise cannot be
								kept perfectly good for a long space of time; especially the wheaten
								ship's biscuit is more liable to become mouldy and musty and worm
								eaten, than any other of the same kind. I have likewise found from
								my own experience, and that of a great many persons on board our
								ship, that the wheaten biscuit causes obstructions, and as seafaring
								men are generally inclined to constipation, this aliment tends
								greatly to increase the evil. I am therefore of opinion that bread
								would be infinitely more wholesome if it be made of rye, or of equal
								parts of rye and of wheat mixed together, or even of wheat alone,
								provided the flour be not quite ground fine, and separated only from
								the coarsest bran; and lastly the bread ought to be made with leaven
								or sour-paste. What convinced me chiefly that these precautions
								would make the bread more salubrious, was the experience we had of
								such bread from the Cape of Good Hope. When we left this last
								mentioned place in November, 1772, we had taken in there as much of
								their bread as our ships could stow away with convenience, in lieu
								of the bread which had been eaten during the passage from Plymouth
								to the Cape. The biscuit we obtained at the Cape, was made of wheat,
								which had not been ground into the finest flour, nor had the bran
								been bolted, and it was prepared with four leaven. This bread,
								according to my own experience, and that of many of our ship-mates,
								stimulated the viscera so gently that it procured stools more
								regularly than the wheaten biscuit. The example of the Russian
								soldiers and sailors, who have no other than rye-biscuit, prepared
								with sour-paste and of a flour from which hardly any bran has been
								separated, and who with this bread alone and hardly any other
								aliment, are healthy, and seldom or ever plagued with the scurvy,
								confirmed me still more in my opinion. The only precautions which
								ought to be taken with this bread are to eat it always after it has
								been soaked, and never when it is quite dry, and secondly to bake
								large loaves of this bread and then to cut them into small cubes of
								about an inch and an half, and bake them over again. This bread is
								certainly less subject to become mouldy or musty, or worm-eaten; its
								acidity and hardness making it less likely to become food for the
								worms: its coarser particles stimulate the intestines and procure
								easy stools, and its acidity not only acts as an antiseptic, but
								causes a greater fermentation with all the other aliments, and
								consequently discharges more fixed air, which sweetens and
								meliorates the putridity of the salt flesh, and with the copious
								inflammable parts of the pease mixes into a food more analogous to
								our juices and whole animal system. The only difficulty I foresee,
								will arise from its being a novelty, and every body versed in naval
								affairs will find that no set of men are brought with greater
								reluctance into an innovation than sailors. But the example of the
								officers, together with a gentle treatment will no doubt in a little
								time get the better of this difficulty, and introduce an aliment on
								board the English navy, which will greatly contribute to the more
								healthy state of the ships company, and thus preserve the lives of
								many an useful member to society.</p><p n="693">The sowerkrout, lately become of more universal use, is of such an
								excellence as an antiseptic as needs no further comment. Its
								preparation is well understood in Germany, Denmark, Sweden, and
								Russia; and has lately been so well prepared for the King's ships in
								England, that it would be needless to dwell on this subject:
								however, as there may be persons desirous of using this salutary
								food, and at the same time ignorant of the method of preparing it, I
								will here annex the following account: solid heads of cabbages are
								taken and cut asunder, and then put into a kind of box, running in
								groves over a machine, similar to those of a less size used for
								cutting cucumbers into slices for salad, which of course must be
								supposed to be greater and proportioned to the business, which is to
								be performed by the machine. The iron planes for cutting the
								cabbages into slices, are made from 12 to 18 inches in length. While
								the box is drawn backwards and forwards over this machine; the heads
								of the cabbages must be gently pressed during the operation, and new
								ones gradually laid in; by which means the cabbages are cut into
								thin slices, and fall into a large tub, whereon the machine is laid.
								These slices of cabbages are, by some persons, mixed up with salt
								and caraway-seeds (Carum Carvi, Linn.) or by others with salt and
								juniper-berries, and then beaten into a cask, or vat, (whereof the
								head has been taken out) till it yields some juice. The instrument
								serving for that purpose, is either a large club of about five or
								six inches in diameter, or a large and strong butter-staff. Caraway
								seeds are to be preferred to juniper berries; since the first are
								very nourishing, and serve, when reduced into flower, to whole
								Tartar nations for food, when boiled with mares milk; and because
								they yield by fermentation, a great quantity of fixed air; and are
								known to increase the milk of wetnurses; qualities, which alone
								would be sufficient to recommend the seeds preferably to juniper
								berries. If the casks wherein the sowerkrout is to be prepared, has
								been a wine, or brandy, or vinegar cask, the fermentation succeeds
								upon the whole better, and imparts to the sowerkrout a more vinous
								taste. Some rub the inside of the cask with sower-leaven, in order
								to accelerate the fermentation, which latter circumstance may be
								omitted, if there is time enough for letting the cabbage go through
								a regular and gradual fermentation. The stamping a new quantity of
								sowerkrout on the first layer of it is always continued, till the
								whole cask be full. Then it is necessary to bring the cask,
								containing the sliced and stamped cabbage, into a place which has a
								moderate temperatur, and, if possible, above 50 or 60 degrees of
								Fahrenheits thermometer: because the warmth greatly promotes, and
								accelerates its vinous fermentation. As soon as it becomes
								acidulated, which will happen in 10, 12, or 14 days, according to
								the degree of warmth, in which the cask is kept, the vat may be
								removed to a cellar, and there preserved. In the beginning a
								quantity of juice is found standing on the top of the fermenting
								cabbage, and with a stick a hole is made in the middle of the cask
								for the better circulation of the fermenting liquor. If this cabbage
								be destined for a long sea voyage, the cabbage is taken out of its
								juice, and in this dry state closely packed in empty casks: but if
								it be intended to be consumed at home, a clean board fitting the
								caks, and loaded with weights for depressing the fermented cabbage,
								is put on the top of it. Of such fermented cabbage or sowerkrout,
								about a pint was served to every individual of our ship's company,
								twice or three times in a week; and it is to this most excellent
								antiseptic, that we chiefly ascribe the little progress which the
								scurvy made on board our ship. Our ship's company grew at last very
								fond of it, especially when they observed its salutary effects in
								preventing the scurvy. We had 60 casks of it on board, and about a
								month before we reached the Cape of Good Hope, in March 1775, the
								whole quantity was apprehended to have been consumed; and the loss
								of it was severely felt by our ship-mates. However, when we arrived
								at the Cape, and all the hold was cleared, we still found two casks,
								of one of which a part was left, when we arrived at Fayal, in the
								Western islands, in July 1775, and was given away by Captain Cook,
								to the British Consul, who relished it very much, and it was then
								found to be as good as when first made in October, 1771.</p><p n="694">Another salutary food is wheat and oatmeal, for breakfast; the wheat
								being more nourishing, is certainly preferable to the oatmeal; but
								as the sooins (a kind of acidulous jelly, and found by experiment to
								be very antiseptic) is prepared from the last article: it will
								always be ranked amongst the salutary food of a ship's company.</p><p n="695">Pease the common food of sailors is no doubt while fresh and
								uncorrupted very salutary; however as they abound in phlogiston, and
								are not sufficiently mixed and rendered analogous to our alimentary
								vessels, it would not be amiss to allow some vinegar to the sailors
								for their pease-soup, which by its acidity will correct this
								excellent food, and by intestine fermentation disengage its fixed
								air, and render it by this means more antiseptic and salubrious.</p><p n="696">Instead of oil it is undoubtedly preferable to allow some sugar to
								people intended to go on long voyages, according to the opinion of
								Capt. Cook.*<ref target="#jf249"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf249">* Capt. Cook's Voyages towards the South Pole, and round the world, vol. ii. p. 290.</note></ref> Sugar is one of those vegetable substances, which
								contain an acid of phosphorus, and an oily inflammable principle;
								and which on account of the just and proper proportion of the acid
								and phlogiston in its mixture, ferments in general more easily,
								yields more freely a vinous fermentation, and when mixed with other
								substances which are not in actual fermentation, it sooner
								communicates a fermentation to them, than any other known vegetable
								substance. This quality no doubt makes sugar one of the best
								antiseptics, and its use will greatly contribute to rectify the
								putrescence of the salt food eaten on board a ship, and prevent the
								scurvy from breaking out.</p><p n="697">The use of sweet-wort, or the infusion of malt, ground in a coarse
								manner into groats or grits, is at present so generally known to be
								the best prophylactic against the scurvy, that it would be
								superfluous to recommend its utility; since Dr. Macbride, Sir John
								Pringle and Captain Cook have put this matter entirely out of doubt.
								The wort was prepared by infusing two or three pints of boiling
								water on one pint of good malt, ground in a coarse manner: the
								infusion was kept in a warm place near the fire of the galley, and
								closely covered to prevent its growing cold: of this liquor the
								persons threatened by the scurvy drank every day one or two pints
								warm, two or three hours before and after their meals; those who had
								already some slight symptoms of the scurvy, drank a quart of this
								wort, twice a day; and lastly, those who were very much attacked by
								that dreadful evil, were allowed three quarts and more. I observed
								wonderful effects of this remedy on board our ship. Amongst other
								scorbutic patients, we had two who were scarcely a few days out at
								sea, when the first symptoms of the scurvy constantly appeared, and
								rapidly increased to a very violent and dangerous degree; their gums
								were bleeding and ulcerated, their teeth loose, their feet
								oedematous,6 with large, livid, and purple blotches; the swelling,
								when pressed by a finger, would leave a pit for a good while; the
								urine smelt offensively putrid, and contained long filaments: and
								one of the men lost entirely the use of his limbs, which became
								contracted: these two patients were not only quite restored by the
								copious use of the sweet-wort, but one of them acquired a quite new
								set of gums, the old ones being much impaired, and having fallen
								gradually away by ulceration; and the other was, in his contraction,
								much relieved, by constantly applying the warm grains of malt,
								(after the infusion or sweet-wort had been drawn off) to his
								crippled limbs; I saw another man, whose swelling and purple
								blotches on the feet disappeared, by frequent fomentations with
								these hot grains. The quantity of malt we had on board, amounted to
								11 large casks; and during the two first years, kept remarkably
								well; but in the third year, some lumps were found mouldered in the
								casks, though some other parts still remained very good; the wort
								procured from this malt was inferior in quality, but by increasing
								the quantity of malt and lessening that of water, the infusion was
								still found a powerful and excellent antiseptic. It has been
								objected against the infusion of malt, that it will not cure the
								scurvy at sea;*<ref target="#jf250"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf250">* Capt. Cook's Voyage, vol. ii. p. 289.</note></ref> since this antiscorbutic sea-medicine will only
								prevent the scurvy from making any great progress for a considerable
								while.=<ref target="#jf251"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf251">= Idem, ibid.</note></ref> But if we consider the two or three cases before mentioned,
								we shall be obliged to allow that they cannot be considered
								otherwise than perfect cures. For we must likewise remark on the
								other hand, that as long as the patient, (who is restored to health
								by the use of the sweet-wort) remains on board, the causes which
								produced the scurvy are not removed; the putrid water continues to
								be his drink, the putrid salt-flesh his diet, and the putrid air is
								at all times inhaled by him, at least during night, between the
								decks, all which circumstances keep up and increase the fomes of
								putrescence in the body. A person therefore with a bad habit of
								body, may be said to have been perfectly cured of the scurvy,
								without daring to leave off the use of the sweet-wort all the time
								he remains on board, for fear of being again attacked by the same
								evil, whose fomes he is continually taking in by way of food, and
								even by his breath. Malt, as every body knows, is made of barley,
								and of all the kinds of grains used for food, which have some
								analogy with the tribe of grasses, it contains more of a sugar-like
								extract than all the rest. When the malt is manufactured, the grains
								of barley are macerated, and then left to ferment in a moderate
								degree of warmth. This fermentation promotes the growth of the
								blade, and of the first roots; but it likewise sets free the sweet
								particles, which were lying as it were dormant, and enveloped in the
								glutinous and starchy substance.*<ref target="#jf252"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf252">* Sage Analyse des bl‚s. Paris, 8vo. 1776.</note></ref> The sweet substance analogous to
								sugar, is more capable of promoting fermentation than any other; the
								malt being dried just at the moment when this sweet substance is
								freed from the others by fermentation, preserves this precious sweet
								juice; and when it is extracted from the malt by the infusion of
								boiling water, the liquor is richly charged with the saccharine
								particles promoting fermentation, sweetening the putrescent parts of
								the salt flesh, and discharging copiously fixed air, which is the
								only substance capable of resisting powerfully the dreadful effects
								of putridity.</p><p n="698">We come now to the water, which is one of the most simple and most
								necessary elements; and which, if become putrid and offensive,
								greatly increases the scene of misery, which opens upon so brave and
								so useful a set of men as the sailors, who devote their health and
								their lives for the defence of their country. We observed, that
								though ventilation takes off a great deal of the offensive smell of
								the water, it remains however ill tasted, putrid and very
								unwholesome. I have, by several experiments, found that putrid water
								contains a liver of sulphur, and as nothing quenches more
								effectually and more suddenly the spreading effluvia of the liver of
								sulphur, and takes off its loathsome taste than quicklime, I would
								propose that quicklime dissolved in water, should be poured in such
								quantities into the putrid water, as may be sufficient to suppress
								both its bad taste and smell. The proportion cannot be ascertained,
								as the degree of putridity of the water is various, and must of
								course require either a greater or less quantity. The quicklime in
								an instant makes the water potable, and in some measure impregnates
								it with fixed air, which by the putrid fermentation is entirely gone
								off. If the water thus prepared be decanted from the precipitate, it
								will not only be palatable, but likewise limpid and clear.*<ref target="#jf253"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf253">* Since the above was written, I have been informed, that the addition of limewater to the fresh water, intended for the use of the people on board of French ships, has entirely prevented in becoming putrid; when the same water, without the addition of limewater, grew very putrid and intolerably offensive.</note></ref></p><p n="699">The same limewater poured into the putrid bilge-water of the
								pump-well, will in an instant, precipitate its putrid particles, and
								render the water inoffensive; to which operation I would always add
								the rarefaction of the air in the pump-well by fire; and am sure
								that both remedies joined together, will not only effectually hinder
								the effluvia from becoming noxious by their effects, but also
								prevent the water from recovering its prutrescency so soon.</p><p n="700">We had on board our ship the rob of lemon and oranges;7 which has by
								no means been found to succeed in obviating the effects of the
								scurvy; and though used on purpose by one or two men by itself
								without the addition of any other remedy, our excellent surgeon, Mr.
								Patton, was of opinion that it did not even stop the progress of the
								scurvy.</p><p n="701">Besides this preventative, we had the marmalade of carrots, which
								consisted of the inspissated8 juice of carrots, extracted by boiling
								and afterwards evaporated by fire to the consistence of a syrup, Mr.
								Muzel-stosch of Berlin, had recommended this marmalade to the
								Society for promoting Arts, Manufactures and Commerce; who referred
								the same to the Board of Admiralty, by whose orders some of it was
								prepared, and given to the surgeons of our ships, in order that they
								might make proper trials of it: they found after some experiments,
								that it had nearly the same effect as the rob of lemons, and perhaps
								had moreover the good quality of keeping the belly open, and
								preventing that constipation which is so general in sea-faring men;
								but it did not cure any scorbutic symptoms, nor even prevent the
								increase of the evil. The inspiffation of the juice of lemons and of
								carrots by fire, has perhaps deprived these two antiscorbutic
								substances of those properties, which might be expected from them,
								if less exposed to the fire; I am therefore of opinion that the
								expressed juice of lemons by itself is a more powerful antiseptic,
								than either the rob or the marmalade of carrots; but as it has been
								very justly apprehended, that the expressed juice of lemons will not
								keep in a good condition for a long space of time; I only beg leave
								to mention, that the Captain with me obtained about thirty gallons
								of lemon-juice at the Cape of Good Hope, to which quantity we added
								about a fifth or a sixth part of brandy or rum which preserved the
								lemon-juice during the space of thirty-two months in so good a
								condition, that it really appeared to us to be as good, as if it had
								been fresh expressed. This acid mixed up with sugar and given to
								scorbutic patients, will undoubtedly with the other remedies greatly
								promote their recovery. These few remarks and hints will I hope
								disclose such a method of preventing the deleterious effects of the
								scurvy on board the Royal Navy, by effectually sweetening of the
								food and water, and meliorating the noxious effluvia of the confined
								air between decks; especially if they be added to the various
								methods proposed and tried by Capt. Cook, in regard to the
								cleanliness of the persons, the airing of the bedding, changing of
								clothes, the airing of the ship by fire and fumigation, and the
								regulation of keeping the crew at three watches, instead of putting
								them as is commonly termed, at watch and watch.</p><p n="702">By the help of the regulations just now exhibited, and some of the
								before mentioned prophylactics, our whole ship's crew enjoyed in
								general a very good state of health: and though we often passed in a
								few weeks from extreme cold, (where we were surrounded by hundreds
								of ice-islands, and had snow and sleet pouring down on our decks;)
								to the most intense degree of heat, i.e. from 2° to 8° or 9° of
								Fahrenheits Thermometer, we were not deprived of the inestimable
								blessing of health.</p><p n="703">The diseases which prevailed in the ship, when we were in the cold
								antarctic regions, where we often had hard blowing weather with
								snow, sleet, and cold penetrating rain and fogs that were continued
								for several days, consisted chiefly in slight colds, rheumatisms,
								sore throats, and swellings of the glands: which latter circumstance
								was, according to my opinion, caused by the ice-water; for when we
								filled thirty or forty casks with small pieces of ice, on which some
								dissolved ice-water was poured, and then struck them down into the
								hold, the temperature of the air was commonly very suddenly altered,
								so that from 5° of Fahrenheits Thermometer, the mercury at once fell
								down to 3° ; and besides this it is well known that ice expels all
								fixed air from water, nor is the melting of the ice by fire, an
								operation which can properly restore its natural quantity of fixed
								air to it. The want of which may very probably cause obstructions in
								the glandular system of our body.</p><p n="704">Besides the above, the chief diseases were fevers. However our ship's
								company was more free from them, than might be expected on a voyage,
								where we underwent so many changes of climate. In the year 1774, in
								February, March, and April, after we left the cold climates, and
								were advancing towards the milder regions, the Captain, my son, my
								servant, and two or three persons more in the ship were attacked by
								the bilious colic; among its symptoms were acute pains, and the
								disease rose to a dangerous height; the Captain especially grew by
								neglecting the disease in the beginning, very weak, and had for
								about twenty-four hours a continued hiccough, however, by the
								indefatigable assiduity and skill of Mr. Patton, our excellent
								surgeon, the patients were restored to health; and though they
								recovered but slowly whilst we were at sea, for want of fresh and
								nourishing food, restoratives and greens; yet as soon as we came to
								Taheitee they durst not venture to eat any of the common fruits of
								the country, as bread-fruit, coco-nuts, and bananas, because they
								renewed their pains; but having at last ventured to eat the fine
								apples of this country, (Spondias) which have a peculiar kind of
								tartness joined to an agreeable sweetness much approaching to the
								taste of pine-apples; they soon felt the salutary effects of this
								most excellent fruit, and were in a few days perfectly restored.</p><p n="705">The sea-scurvy did not make such ravages on board our ship as might
								have been expected, on account of the regulations enumerated before
								and the use of the excellent prophylactics and remedies, which were
								freely administered, and of which we have spoken very fully.</p><p n="706">The venereal disease was very frequent among our ships-company, so
								that sometimes thirty or forty persons were at once infected; but
								the vigilance and skill of Mr. Patton always prevented this disease
								from rising to any great height, and from leaving any dangerous
								effects. I cannot conclude this article without mentioning, that I
								have lately learnt from a letter written by Dr. Hengler, Physican to
								the King of Denmark, to a friend of mine, who kindly communicated
								its contents to me, that he has collected many very old historical
								facts from Chronicles and Records, by which it appears beyond a
								possibility of doubt, that this evil was known in various parts of
								Europe several centuries before the discovery of America by
								Christopher Columbus in 1493, and it is particularly to be remarked
								that in the North of Germany the friars and monks were observed to
								disseminate the evil more than any other set of people. As this
								learned and ingenious gentleman intend to communicate to the public
								the result of his enquiries, which I have here the happiness to
								announce, we shall be farther convinced by irrefragable proofs, of
								the facts already asserted in the Philosophical Transactions, vol.
								xxvii and xxxi. No. 365, II.</p><p n="707">I cannot omit here a circumstance which befel us, and might perhaps
								have proved fatal to many of us, if proper care had not been taken
								to prevent the ill consequences of it.9 When we were at anchor at
								Port Sandwich in Mallicollo, on the 23d of July, 1774, our people
								caught in the night two or three large reddish fish, which they
								immediately cleared of the garbage and scales, and cut the belly and
								gills open, with some of the fins, so that when I got up in the
								morning I suspected them to be a new kind of fish, as we were not
								able to describe or examine them in this mangled state: but as we
								hoped to stay many nights more in that place, I expected to obtain
								other specimens for examination; however we removed from that port
								the day after, without catching another fish of the same kind. When
								we were at New Caledonia, a sailor caught another fish of the same
								species during the night, and had unfortunately thrown away the
								garbage, scraped the scales, and cut away the gills and fins. The
								scarcity of fresh food made this last fish a desirable object,
								notwithstanding the eating of the former had caused very alarming
								symptoms. The sailor therefore salted the fish, and let it hang
								three or four days, and then eat it in company with his mess-mates,
								without feeling the least bad effects from this imprudent step. The
								fish had in its mangled state a similarity to the red gilthead
								(Sparus Pagrus, Linn.) which is the more probable, since Quiros
								observed that his whole ship's crews were poisoned at the same place
								by a fish. which he called Pargo.*<ref target="#jf254"><note anchored="true" xml:id="jf254">* Dalrymple's Collection of Voyages, vol. i. p. 140, 141.</note></ref> The same night that the reddish
								fishes were caught at Mallicollo, several rock-fish, (Labri) an
								Indian sucking-fish, (Echeneis Neucrates) and a shark nine feet long
								were likewise caught and eaten that day, without causing any
								alarming symptoms. When we came to New-Caledonia, a native killed at
								the mouth of a fresh-water river on the reef, a new cartilaginous
								fish of the genus called by Linnaeus Tetradon. The Captain's Clerk
								bought it for the Captain, and after we had made a description and
								sketch of it, it was ordered the next day for dinner. My son as well
								as myself told Capt. Cook that we were of opinion the fish was not
								proper for food, as it belonged to a suspicious class; but the
								Captain was of opinion, that he had eaten the same kind of fish in
								the last voyage on the coast of New Holland, and this was sufficient
								to quiet our apprehensions. Whilst we were at supper, the servant
								shewed us the liver, which looked very tempting, for people who had
								been for some time deprived of fresh food; we had it therefore
								fried, but as it came after supper, I ate of it about the size of
								two half-crown pieces, and the Captain with my son only tasted it,
								each to the size of about half a crown piece. It had no bad taste
								and we expected to have a good dinner of the fish next day. In the
								morning about three o'clock I awoke from an uneasiness similar to
								that when the stomach is out of order on account of a surfeit. I sat
								upright in the bed and found my head giddy and swimming, I wanted to
								remove a chair from before the bed, which in my hands was as light
								as a feather, and I found I could not distinguish heavy things from
								light ones. When I began to walk, I reeled from one side of the
								cabin to the other. I felt in the stomach a heaviness and a burning,
								which extended all the length of the gullet, as if it had been
								excoriated, and my extremities were benumbed. I had a stool and in
								order to alleviate the stomach, endeavoured to void by vomiting its
								contents, but this caused such a burning all along from the mouth to
								the stomach, that I thought the whole to be wounded. I waked Dr.
								Sparrman and spoke to him about my situation; as he was separated
								only by a deal partition from the Captain's state room, Capt. Cook
								overheard our discourse, and tried to get up, when he found that he
								had the same symptoms which I experienced. I then waked my son, who
								was in the same situation. The Captain sent for our surgeon Mr.
								Patton, who prescribed us plenty of warm water, in order to free the
								stomach of any remains of this dangerous diet, and then gave us some
								diaphoretics, and salts, which in a few days restored us to our
								former health; though the giddiness of the head, the numbness of our
								hands and feet, a constant chillness, and some few pains were not
								quite removed till after almost eight or ten days. A dog which had
								eaten the remainder of the fried liver, and a hog given me by an old
								man at Tanna, which had devoured the garbage of the fish, fell
								likewise very sick, and the latter died the next day. Several
								natives coming on board, saw the fish hanging, and gave us to
								understand by signs, that it was unwholsome food, for they pointed
								to their stomach, and showed that it caused pains there, and
								afterwards laid their hand to the cheek and ear, and made a motion
								of the head as if they were going to sleep. I feigned not to
								comprehend the meaning of these signs, and as if I believed they
								wanted the fish to eat, I ordered it to be given to them; but they
								shewed the most unequivocal signs of abhorrence, when it was offered
								to them.</p><p n="708">The fishes eaten at Mallicollo, caused in the evening violent
								reachings, gripes and looseness, preceded by an uneasiness similar
								to that which I had felt; a violent head-ache and pain in the face,
								with a burning heat, followed immediately after this; and extended
								to the hands and legs. The pulse was by no means feverish or strong,
								as might have been expected from the great heat which every one
								felt, but was rather low and weak. About sixteen or eighteen persons
								who had eaten of the fish were all ill of this poison, and had more
								or less the same symptoms, to which we must add the same torpor in
								the extremities. The pains continued for several days in the stomach
								and in all the limbs, with the heat and also a giddiness, which
								would not suffer them to walk or hardly to stand. All along the
								throat they felt a pain equal to that of an excoriation in that
								part. In some few patients the salival glands were swelled, and
								discharged an extraordinary quantity of saliva, so that it run out
								of their mouths involuntarily. In a few a painful erection of the
								penis was observed: and some even found that their teeth were grown
								loose. When they recovered it was but slowly, and as often as they
								were exposed to cold, the pain and stiffness of the limbs returned,
								and upon the whole every evening the symptoms of restlessness, pain
								and heaviness were renewed, nay, after the expiration of a fortnight
								when they were quite free from pains and other symptoms, they found
								themselves chilly. The surgeon prescribed the same remedies, which
								we had taken by his direction. A tame Taheitean parroquet, which had
								eaten a very small morsel of the fish died in great agonies. All the
								dogs, which had been fed with the bones, fins and entrails of the
								fish, fell violently sick and continued so for a long while: one
								that had retired into a boat and was lying in some water became
								quite paralytic, and was ordered to be cast over-board to shorten
								his agonies: another dog equally sick, received from his master an
								infusion of tobacco by way of emetic, but he fell a sacrifice to the
								remedy. A hog which had eaten of the entrails, likewise died within
								24 hours.</p><p n="709">The circumstances here related seem to intimate, that the Sparus
								Pagrus or Pargos is not a poisonous fish, but only become noxious,
								when it has taken some dangerous food. The fish which were caught at
								Port Sandwich, together with the Pagrus, proved wholesome, which
								proves that their food differs from that of the Pargos. The Tetrodon
								Sceleratus alone seems to be poisonous of itself, since the natives
								of New Caledonia were acquainted with its noxious and deleterious
								quality; but if we again consider, that the Tetrodon caused the same
								symptoms as the Pargos, (only in an inferior degree, because we ate
								so very little of it) it is obvious, that the Tetrodon likewise must
								have received this deleterious quality from the nature of its food.
								I wish to have had it in my power to examine the entrails of all
								these fish, because I do not in the least doubt, but the examination
								of them would have immediately shewed the true cause of these
								symptoms; and as nothing occurs, which might have caused these
								effect, I suspect that these fish live chiefly upon blubbers,
								(Medusae) some of which we know to be of a very burning quality,
								when brought into contact with our skin, and probably would be
								capable of producing all the abovementioned symptoms if taken
								internally. It might be here objected, that if the blubbers are so
								noxious, how happens it that the fish eat them without being
								affected in the same manner as we were: but if we consider, that
								fish eat, without injury, even manchenil-apples (Hippomane
								Mancinella) which would kill a man; it becomes so much the more
								probable that fishes may live on a food, which to men is highly
								noxious. The natives, however, seem to be well acquainted with the
								poisonous quality of the fish: it would be adviseable therefore to
								enquire of them whether it may be eaten with safety, and they are
								every where good-natured enough to give fair warning when there is
								the least danger. This circumstance leads us to make the following
								remarks: the first is, that mankind ought to be considered as the
								members of one great family; therefore let us not despise any of
								them, though they be our inferiors in regard to many improvements
								and points of civilization; none of them is so despicable that he
								should not, in some one point or other, know more than the wisest
								man of the most polished nation. This knowledge may be easily
								obtained from them by friendliness, kindness, and gentleness; and if
								so bought it is cheaply obtained. The second observation points out
								the necessity of sending out men versed in science, and the
								knowledge of nature on all occasions to remote parts of the world,
								in order to investigate the powers and qualities of natural objects;
								and it is not enough to send them out, but they ought likewise to be
								encouraged in their laborious task, liberally supported and
								generously enabled to make such enquiries as may prevent their
								fellow creatures in future times from becoming sacrifices to their
								own ignorance.</p><p n="710"><q><emph>Quibusdam &amp; iis quidem non admodum indoctis, totum hoc
