            <head>Coding and Digital Archives: Course Description</head>
            <p>This course is all about doing interesting things with texts using computers and
               digital technology, in order to build cultural resources on the public web. In taking this course you will gain experience with textual scholarship, editing, and digital production, and you will learn a variety of coding designed for systematic building and sharing of information resources.</p>
             <p>This course is meant to be complementary with the <ref target="CDV.html">Coding and Data Visualization course</ref> taught in spring semesters, but where the emphasis in that course is on analyzing data to produce informational graphics, this course concentrates on curating and preparing reading views of documents. Neither course is meant to be a prerequisite for the other: you may take either one as a beginner. Returning students (in either semester) serve as student instructor-mentors to beginning students for units and assignments they have already completed confidently.</p>
            <p>Our class is one of the core courses of <ref target="http://greensburg.pitt.edu/academics/info/digital-studies">Pitt-Greensburg’s Digital Studies Certificate</ref>, and it satisifes a range of
               general education requirements in quantitative reasoning,
               behavioral sciences, and humanities. That is because this course is distinctively
               interdisciplinary in engaging formal and
               quantitative reasoning through computer coding in ways that matter to students in
               humanities and social sciences who are not training to be computer scientists.
               Students gain hands-on experience in this course with applying computer coding to
               represent and investigate cultural materials. As we design projects together, you
               will gain practical experience in editing and you will certainly fine-tune your
               precision in writing and thinking. You will also be learning in an openly collaborative environment (as professional coders learn and work) with an emphasis on building sustainable and freely accessible resources on the public web.</p>

            <p>Students who complete this course will gain skills in practical hands-on programming, digital project management, and
               web development, and their digital projects will distinguish them as investigators
               and makers, able to wield computers creatively and effectively for human interests.
               Your success will require patience, dedication, and regular communication and
               interaction with us, working through assignments on a daily basis. Your success will
               <hi>not</hi> require perfection, but rather your regular efforts throughout the course, your
               documenting of problems when your coding doesn’t yield the results you want. Homework
               exercises are a back-and-forth, intensive dialogue between you and your instructors,
               and we plan to spend a great deal of time with you individually over these as we work
               together. Our guiding principle in developing assignments and working with you is
               that the best way for you to learn and succeed is through regular practice as you
               hone your skills. Our goal is not to make you expert programmers (as we are far from
               that ourselves). Instead, we want you to learn how to apply coding technologies for
               your own purposes, how to track down answers to questions, how to think your way
               algorithmically (step-by-step) through problems to find good solutions.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="description" style="main"><head>Learning to Code: Our Context</head>
             <p>You do not need any background or experience at all with computer programming or web development to succeed in this course. 
                 We teach practical programming as a foundational skill (like reading, writing, and arithmetic) that all students should experience regardless of major or background.</p>
             <p>You will be learning to code with practical goals in mind: to build a digital project to investigate a research topic in the humanities, working with eXtensible Markup Language (XML) and languages connected with it.
   XML is a powerful tool for modelling texts that we can adapt creatively to our interests and
               questions. You will learn how to work with regular expressions to match patterns in plain text and <q>up-convert</q> them to an XML document. You’ll learn how to write XPath expressions: a formal language
               for searching and extracting information from XML code which serves as the basis for
               transforming XML into many publishable forms. You’ll learn to
               write XSLT: a programming “stylesheet” transforming language designed to convert XML
               to publishable formats, as well as to
               extract information and plot it in charts in graphs in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). You will learn how to
               design your own systematic coding methods to work on projects, and how to write your
               own rules in schema languages (like Schematron and Relax-NG) to keep your projects
               organized and prevent errors. You’ll gain experience with an international XML
               language called TEI (after the Text Encoding Initiative) which serves as an
               international standard for coding digital archives of cultural materials. Since one
               of the best and most widely accessible ways to publish XML is on the worldwide web,
               you’ll gain working experience with HTML code (a markup language that is a kind of
               XML), styling HTML with Cascading Stylesheets (CSS), and adding dynamic features to your website with JavaScript. You will also, all along, be working with Git and GitHub for collaborating with the class and your project team, and gaining command line (or shell) experience.</p>
         <p> While we are using XML in an academic research context, 
             what you learn here is also important in the tech industry, where XML is the internal format for many general applications (used for bank and hospital records, and the basis of the entire Microsoft Office and LibreOffice software packages). 
         XML is important, too, for web developers, where the HTML (hypertext markup language) of web pages to be viewed in browsers is often expressed as a form of XML (as we will be applying it).  Developers of relational databases widely appreciate XML, too, as a universal data interchange format.
         Learning the XML <q>family of languages</q> in a humanities context may give you a strong foundation in practical computing experience whatever your major, and we hope what you learn here will help you build a distinctive portfolio of skills and projects.

Students must complete on time at least 90% of all assigned homework exercises in order to pass the course. For students who complete the 90% requirement, the homework

                      <hi rend="em">Coding assignments:</hi> Coding exercises in this course are about your learning and studying, and not—as in other courses—a way of testing whether you have already learned something we covered in class or in an assigned reading. You may often need to look up how to do something that you don’t already know how to do. Often, there will be multiple ways of accomplishing the task and we are not simply looking for you to do things perfectly in just one way--we are instead looking for a record of your learning process as you take on a challenge. Documenting problems is key to the learning process, and sometimes just writing out what you are trying to do helps lead you to a solution! When we post solutions for homework assignments, part of your homework may be to complete a write-up reviewing what you missed and assessing what you needed to do for the correct answer. There may be times when you don’t get the result you want in the homework, and that is to be expected! In those cases you can still get full credit for the assignment if you’ve made a serious attempt and if you submit, along with your code, a description of what else you tried, what results you expected, what results you got, and what you think went wrong. Getting stuck is part of the learning process and the instructors will be happy to help unstick you as long as you’ve described your understanding of the problem and your attempts to resolve it on your own.</p>
                   <p>The instructors will read and evaluate all student homework, and will post an assessment in the Courseweb Grade Center. Coding assignments are assessed as <q>check plus</q>, <q>check</q>, and <q>check minus</q>, or <q>redo</q>. Don’t think of these as grades, since they all receive full credit; they are feedback, for learning purposes, about how well you engaged with the assignment. If you have not engaged with the assignment adequately (whether that means solving the tasks or discussing the coding obstacles you encountered and how you dealt with them), we will ask you to meet with us to review the issues and then complete a followup (redo) task in order to receive credit. For assignments with posted solutions, we invite you to review the posted solution on GitHub and comment on it (we will show you how to do this) to address something you learned from the solution or did in a different way. For some assignments where we review posted solutions and line-comments together in person or in class, we will write back to you with individual comments only if your specific submission raises an issue that we don’t address elsewhere. If we don’t return your assignment, that means that we have nothing to add to our posted solution, but should you have any specific questions after you’ve read our posted solution, please ask the instructors. </p>

Your posting should do more than
                     summarize the article or site (which you could just do by skimming or reading
                     the first paragraph), but should demonstrate a thoughtful reflection on
                     specific ideas and issues. When evaluating a web resource, don’t simply praise
                     or condemn it without going into details about why a key component is effective
                     or poorly designed. Good posts demonstrate care and reflection, and
                     you may choose to respond to the overarching ideas of a piece, or to selected
                     details of specific interest. These posts are scored as <q>check plus</q>, <q>check</q>, and <q>check minus</q>.</p>

               <head>Participation: In Class and on the DH-ClassHub (15%):</head>
               <p> Coding and programming in real life is a social activity, and professionals in
                  the real world aren’t “know-it-all” experts who work alone, but rather are tuned
                  into discussion boards and regularly ask and answer questions to stay sharp and to
                  learn from their community. In this class, we want you to work together and talk
                  to each other and your instructors as your community resource, so we have built
                  this into our course participation grade as a formal expectation. <hi>Beginning by week two, we’ll expect each student to post at least once per
                      week on <ref target="https://github.com/ebeshero/DHClass-Hub/issues">our course GitHub repo</ref></hi>, and we strongly encourage you
                  to do more than this minimum. Earn an <q>A</q> in participation by asking questions, making suggestions, and sharing helpful
                  resources you’ve found. Help each other out by trying to answer questions on GitHub (and
                  read the instructor posts too as we wade in to help). Your instructors will likely
                  be dominating the class time as we model concepts and methods, so the GitHub Issues board gives the students a good space to form into a coding community to help each
                  other and reflect together. Also, if you have a question about an assignment, <hi rend="em">always think of our GitHub Issues board as your first resource</hi> to
                  check for helpful hints and to post your questions, because others may have the
                  same question and answers are best shared! Of course you may e-mail us, but we
                  really prefer you go the discussion board first, and doing so is, after all, worth
                  course credit as your participation grade.</p>

               <p>As scheduled throughout the course there will be several (probably about five or six) tests on the various kinds of coding we are learning in the course, and we will drop the lowest grade.  All but the first test will be take-home and assigned over a weekend. They are open-book, open notes, but they must be completed individually and are designed to demonstrate that you have learned from the class material, coding assignments, and posted solutions.  Tests may resemble homework assignments, but unlike homework exercises, these are given letter grades. These are given grades because they are evaluative and involve demonstrating what you have learned after we have finished a coding unit.</p>

                <p>Throughout the semester you will be working as part of a team on a course project. Early in the semester each student posts a proposal for a semester project to work with a text (or collection of texts) in the public domain and a set of research questions to explore in a coding project. Teams will form around a selection of these projects in mid-September and begin work, performing document analysis, developing and implementing a system of markup and project rules, marking up text following that system, writing programs to conduct research and create a resource to share on a public website you will develop together that represents your investigation and your conclusions. Each project team must meet regularly together and with a project mentor (one of the instructor team) outside of class for project planning and discussion. Each of the project components described below adds up to 40% of your grade for the course.</p> 
                <div type="projectChecks"><p><hi rend="em">Project Checkpoints</hi> There will be a series of project checkpoints to complete, by set due dates throughout the semester.

Each checkpoint will expect you to complete a stage of serious work on the course project with your project team. Project Checkpoints are met using the Issues and/or Projects tabs on your project GitHub repository and by posting files on the project website on newtFire.</p>

               <head>E-mail:</head>
               <p>Each student is issued a University email address (username@pitt.edu) upon
                  admission. This email address may be used by the University for official
                  communication with students. Students are expected to read email sent to this
                  account on a regular basis. Failure to read and react to University communications
                  in a timely manner does not absolve the student from knowing and complying with
                  the content of the communications. The University provides an email forwarding
                  service that allows students to read their email via other service providers
                  (e.g., Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo). Students who choose to forward their email from their
                  pitt.edu address to another address do so at their own risk. If email is lost as a
                  result of forwarding, it does not absolve the student from responding to official
                  communications sent to their University email address. To forward email sent to
                  your University account, go to http://accounts.pitt.edu, log into your account,
                  click on Edit Forwarding Addresses, and follow the instructions on the page. Be
                  sure to log out of your account when you have finished. (For the full Email

               <p>
                  <hi rend="em">Source Citation and Plagiarism:</hi> One goal of our course is to
                  reflect on how best to cite sources in digital contexts. We will consider how and
                  why such citations differ from documenting printed texts. We will also consider
                  the ease and frequency with which digital texts and graphics are plagiarized on
                  the worldwide web, and discuss how the omission of source citations detracts from
                  the authority of a digital information resource. We expect you to practice mindful
                  source citation, and plagiarism on your part will have very serious
                  consequences.</p>
                <p>Representing the voice
                    of another individual as your own voice constitutes plagiarism, however generous
                    that person may be in “helping” you with an assignment. Turning in an assignment
                    generated collectively under the name of a single individual is considered
                    plagiarism. <hi rend="em">When instructed to collaborate on a project, project
                        collaborators share collective authorship and should identify themselves
                        directly as a team.</hi> To avoid plagiarism, cite your sources whenever you
                    quote, paraphrase, or summarize material, or use digital images from any outside
                    source (including websites, articles, books, course readings, Courseweb or GitHub postings,
                    or someone else’s notes). When using the “copy” and “paste” features as you read
                    and research, be sure that you are carefully marking that these passages are
                    unprocessed from their source, so that you know to process it later. Forgetting to
                    do so not only produces sloppy work but (whether you intended it or not) results
                    in a false representation. As long as you make a good faith and clear effort to
                    cite your sources, you will not be faulted for plagiarism, but your work will be
                    penalized if citations are inaccurate, unclear, or lack important information.</p>
                <p>That said, the coding and digital development we do encourages collaboration, and for that reason we adopt our colleague David Birnbaum's <ref target="http://dh.obdurodon.org/collaboration.xhtml">Collaboration policy</ref>, which specifies that students identify collaborators in a comment on submitted asignments and take care on projects that all students contribute equally (and no student is contributing excessively more than what everyone else has done). When joining a group homework session, always work on the assignment by yourself first so you can be an equal participant, and write up the assignment <hi rend="ital">by yourself, after</hi> the session is over so you take care not to copy from the other students. While we want you to consult with each other, you are responsible for doing all your writing and coding by yourself, using your own words.</p>
                    
                   
               <p>Plagiarism falsely represents another source’s words or ideas as your own, and, if
                  you commit plagiarism in this course, you will receive a final course grade of F
                  and, at Greensburg campus, be reported to the Vice President for Academic Affairs. At Greensburg campus, cheating on exams or exercises will also receive a final course grade of F and
                  will be reported to the Vice President for Academic Affairs.</p>  <p>All Pitt students and instructors (from Pittsburgh and Greensburg) are required to observe <ref target="https://as.pitt.edu/faculty/policies-and-procedures/academic-integrity-code">the Dietrich School Academic Integrity guidelines</ref>, and violations of the Academic Integrity Code will be addressed according to those guidelines.</p>
