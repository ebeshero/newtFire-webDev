      <p>Your homework exercise is to draw a bar graph <q>by hand</q> in SVG to compare the sizes
         of three Pacific islands. (And since we’re thinking about Pacific islands, just for
         fun we’ve found an SVG map of Tahiti and Mo’orea to illustrate this page: Try resizing
         your browser window and watch as the map scales up and down!)
      </p>
      			
      <p>Here’s the data you need to graph--<b>the areas in square miles of three Polynesian islands:</b> 
         				
      </p>
      <div id="outline">
         					
         <ul>
            						
            <li>Tahiti 404 sq mi; </li>
            					
            <li>Raiatea 65 sq mi; </li>
            					
            <li>Tongatapu 100 sq mi</li>
         </ul>
         				
      </div>
      			
      <div id="explan">
         				<img src="TahitiMoorea.svg" alt="SVG map of Tahiti and Mo’orea islands" width="75%" height="75%" />
         			
      </div>
      			
      <p><b>Here’s what you need to do:</b></p>
      			
      <ol>
         <li>First, open a new SVG file in &lt;oXygen/&gt;, by going to File, New, and typing SVG in the filter text window. From the list, choose SVG 1.1. You will see a simple empty SVG file that looks like this:
         <pre>
            &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.0//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-SVG-20010904/DTD/svg10.dtd"&gt;
&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="100%" height="100%"&gt;
    &lt;desc&gt;&lt;/desc&gt;
    &lt;g alignment-baseline="baseline"&gt;
    <code>&lt;!--Write your SVG line and rectangle and text elements here!--&gt;</code>
    &lt;/g&gt;
&lt;/svg&gt;</pre>
            You can just delete the empty <code>&lt;desc&gt;</code> element, or write a description of what you are graphing (up to you). The <code>&lt;g&gt;</code> element is not strictly necessary either, but it is simply used to <em>group</em> related parts of an SVG graphic, such as lines and text. <strong>You can write your SVG elements inside the <code>&lt;g&gt;</code> element.</strong> Save your file (using our standard homework naming file conventions) and view your work in making a graphic by opening it locally in a web browser. (You can also try looking at it in the "Author" view inside &lt;oXygen/&gt;, but it might not render completely there and will look better in a browser window.)
         </li>
         <li>Make a bar graph that has an x axis and a y axis, using the SVG <span class="code">&lt;line&gt;</span> element.
         </li>
         				
         <li>Now, make three bars of different colors using the SVG <span class="code">&lt;rect&gt;</span> element. Experiment with size and scale of your bars for viewing on a web browser!
         </li> 
         				
         <li>Finally, use the SVG <span class="code">&lt;text&gt;</span> element to put labels on the axes or the bars to indicate the island names and the
            numerical values. Position text across the top to give your graph a title that indicates
            what we’re seeing: the relative size in square miles of three Pacific islands.
         </li>
      </ol>
      			
      <p><a href="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/svg/text-element.html">Read about how to work with the SVG <span class="code">&lt;text&gt;</span></a> element, orienting text direction, setting font size, etc. For example, try making
         vertical text, and adjusting the spacing between letters. (Overall, we really like
         this site, <a href="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/svg/index.html">Jakob Jenkov’s tutorial on SVG</a>, as it seems better organized and more informative than <a href="http://w3schools.com/svg/default.asp">the one at w3schools</a>--but feel free to explore both!)

      <h3>The Weirdness of the Y-Axis in SVG coordinate space</h3>
      			
      			
      <p>Remember, as we saw in class, in SVG the y-axis is upside-down! Low y-values close
         to zero sit near the top, and as y values increase, we move <b>down</b> the screen. This means that if you draw your chart using positive y values, the way
         you’d draw it on a sheet on graph paper, the bars will grow downwards instead of upwards,
         and their baseline will be at the top, not the bottom.
      </p>
      			
      			
      <p>If you want to draw a vertical bar graph the usual way with the bottom along an x-axis,
         here’s a way you can do it: Say you want to graph two bars, one with a height of 25
         and the other with a height of 50. Make rectangles with heights of 25 and 50, but
         set the shorter bar at a y position that’s 25 units MORE than the longer one. Try
         making your baseline be at 50, and run your long bar UP THE SCREEN to 0. Then make
         your short bar go from 50 up to 25. (This may be easier to visualize by drawing it
         on a piece of paper with a pencil, and labelling the values, realizing you’ve got
         to deal with the y-axis backwards.
      </p> 
      			
      			
      <p>We’ll eventually be handling this y-axis weirdness in other ways as we make SVG from
         XSLT, but for this exercise, just to learn your way around SVG, we’d like you to
         "hand-code" your graph this way.
