                  <a href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/">&lt;oXygen/&gt;</a>. The University of Pittsburgh has purchased a site license for this software, which
                  is installed in
                  the Pitt computer labs on multiple campuses, and it’s in use in courses here at
                  Greensburg and at Oakland. The license also permits students enrolled in the
                  course to install the software on their home computers (for course-related use
                  only). When installing this on your own computers, <strong>you will need the
                     license key</strong>, which we have posted on our course Announcements section of
                  <a href="https://courseweb.pitt.edu">Courseweb</a>.

            <h2>Coding and Digital Archives: Course Description</h2>
            
            <p>This course is all about working with computers and digital technology to build cultural
               resources on the public web. In taking this course you will gain experience with textual
               scholarship, editing, and digital production, and you will learn a variety of coding
               designed for systematic building and sharing of information resources.
            </p>
            
            <p>This course is meant to be complementary with the <a href="CDV.html">Coding and Data Visualization course</a> taught in spring semesters, but where the emphasis in that course is on analyzing
               data to produce informational graphics, this course concentrates on curating and preparing
               reading views of documents. Neither course is meant to be a prerequisite for the other:
               you may take either one as a beginner. Returning students (in either semester) serve
               as student instructor-mentors to beginning students for units and assignments they
               have already completed confidently.
            </p>
            
            <p>Our class is one of the core courses of <a href="http://greensburg.pitt.edu/academics/info/digital-studies">Pitt-Greensburg’s Digital Studies Certificate</a>, and it satisifes a range of
               general education requirements in quantitative reasoning,
               behavioral sciences, and humanities. That is because this course is distinctively
               interdisciplinary in engaging formal and
               quantitative reasoning through computer coding in ways that matter to students in
               humanities and social sciences who are not training to be computer scientists.
               Students gain hands-on experience in this course with applying computer coding to
               represent and investigate cultural materials. As we design projects together, you
               will gain practical experience in editing and you will certainly fine-tune your
               precision in writing and thinking. You will also be learning in an openly collaborative
               environment (as professional coders learn and work) with an emphasis on building sustainable
               and freely accessible resources on the public web.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Students who complete this course will gain skills in practical hands-on programming,
               digital project management, and
               web development. Their digital projects will distinguish them as investigators
               and makers, able to wield computers creatively and effectively for human interests.
               Your success will require patience, dedication, and regular communication and
               interaction with us, working through assignments on a daily basis. Your success will
               <strong>not</strong> require perfection, but rather your regular efforts throughout the course and your
               documenting of problems when your coding doesn’t yield the results you want. Homework
               exercises are a back-and-forth, intensive dialogue between you and your instructors,
               and we plan to spend a great deal of time with you individually over these as we work
               together. Our guiding principle in developing assignments and working with you is
               that the best way for you to learn and succeed is through regular practice as you
               hone your skills. Our goal is not to make you expert programmers (as we are far from
               that ourselves). Instead, we want you to learn how to apply coding technologies for
               your own purposes, how to track down answers to questions, how to think your way
               algorithmically (step-by-step) through problems to find good solutions.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Learning to Code: Our Context</h2>
            
            <p>You do not need any background or experience at all with computer programming or web
               development to succeed in this course. 
               We teach practical programming as a foundational skill (like reading, writing, and
               arithmetic) that all students should experience regardless of major or background.
            </p>
            
            <p>You will be learning to code with practical goals in mind: to build a digital project
               to investigate a research topic in the humanities, working with eXtensible Markup
               Language (XML) and languages connected with it.
               XML is a powerful tool for modelling texts that we can adapt creatively to our interests
               and
               questions. You will learn how to work with regular expressions to match patterns in
               plain text and <q>up-convert</q> them to an XML document. You’ll learn how to write XPath expressions: a formal language
               for searching and extracting information from XML code which serves as the basis for
               transforming XML into many publishable forms. You’ll learn to
               write XSLT: a programming “stylesheet” transforming language designed to convert XML
               to publishable formats, as well as to
               extract information and plot it in charts in graphs in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG).
               You will learn how to
               design your own systematic coding methods to work on projects, and how to write your
               own rules in schema languages (like Schematron and Relax-NG) to keep your projects
               organized and prevent errors. You’ll gain experience with an international XML
               language called TEI (after the Text Encoding Initiative) which serves as an
               international standard for coding digital archives of cultural materials. Since one
               of the best and most widely accessible ways to publish XML is on the worldwide web,
               you’ll gain working experience with HTML code (a markup language that is a kind of
               XML), styling HTML with Cascading Stylesheets (CSS), and adding dynamic features to
               your website with JavaScript. You will also, all along, be working with Git and GitHub
               for collaborating with the class and your project team, and gaining command line (or
               shell) experience.
            </p>
            
            <p> While we are using XML in an academic research context, 
               what you learn here is also important in the tech industry, where XML is the internal
               format for many general applications (used for bank and hospital records, and the
               basis of the entire Microsoft Office and LibreOffice software packages). 
               XML is important, too, for web developers, where the HTML (hypertext markup language)
               of web pages to be viewed in browsers is often expressed as a form of XML (as we will
               be applying it).  Developers of relational databases widely appreciate XML, too, as
               a universal data interchange format.
               Learning the XML <q>family of languages</q> in a humanities context may give you a strong foundation in practical computing experience
               whatever your major, and we hope what you learn here will help you build a distinctive
               portfolio of skills and projects.

            <p>To keep up with this class, you must work on exercises regularly.
               Each day will involve some small assignment, to prepare you for the next of class,
               and to help you to build your course project.  Students must complete on time at least
               90% of all assigned homework exercises in order to pass the course. For students who
               complete the 90% requirement, the homework
               taken all together, is worth 30% of your course grade.

            <p>
               <strong>Coding assignments:</strong> Coding exercises in this course are about your active learning, and not—as in other
               courses—a way of testing whether you have already learned something we covered in
               class or in an assigned reading. You may often need to look up how to do something
               that you don’t already know how to do. Often, there will be multiple ways of accomplishing
               the task and we are not simply looking for you to do things perfectly in just one
               way. We are instead looking for a record of your learning process as you take on a
               challenge. Documenting problems is key to learning, and sometimes just writing out
               what you are trying to do helps lead you to a solution! When we post solutions for
               homework assignments, part of your homework may be to write a comment to review what
               you missed and assessing what you needed to do for the correct answer. There may be
               times when you don’t get the result you want in the homework, and that is to be expected!
               In those cases you can still get full credit for the assignment if you’ve made a serious
               attempt and if you submit, along with your code, a description of what else you tried,
               what results you expected, what results you got, and what you think went wrong. Getting
               stuck is part of the learning process and the instructors will be happy to help unstick
               you as long as you’ve described your understanding of the problem and your attempts
               to resolve it on your own.
            </p>
            
            <p>The instructors will read and evaluate all student homework, and will post an assessment
               in the Courseweb Grade Center. Coding assignments are assessed as <q>check plus</q>, <q>check</q>, and <q>check minus</q>, or <q>redo</q>. Don’t think of these as grades, since they all receive full credit; they are feedback,
               for learning purposes, about how well you engaged with the assignment. If you have
               not engaged with the assignment adequately (whether that means solving the tasks or
               discussing the coding obstacles you encountered and how you dealt with them), we will
               ask you to meet with us to review the issues and then complete a followup (redo) task
               in order to receive credit. For assignments with posted solutions, we invite you to
               review the posted solution on GitHub and comment on it (we will show you how to do
               this) to address something you learned from the solution or did in a different way.
               For some assignments where we review posted solutions and line-comments together in
               person or in class, we will write back to you with individual comments only if your
               specific submission raises an issue that we don’t address elsewhere. If we don’t return
               your assignment, that means that we have nothing to add to our posted solution, but
               should you have any specific questions after you’ve read our posted solution, please
               ask the instructors. 
            </p>
            
            
            
            <p>
               <strong>Issue posts:</strong> Throughout the course, we’ll assign discussion posts on <a href="https://github.com/ebeshero/DHClass-Hub/issues">our class GitHub site</a> in which you will respond to online readings or evaluate web resources. Your posting
               should do more than
               summarize the article or site (which you could just do by skimming or reading
               the first paragraph), but should demonstrate a thoughtful reflection on
               specific ideas and issues. When evaluating a web resource, don’t simply praise
               or condemn it without going into details about why a key component is effective
               or poorly designed. Good posts demonstrate care and reflection, and
               you may choose to respond to the overarching ideas of a piece, or to selected
               details of specific interest. These posts are scored as <q>check plus</q>, <q>check</q>, and <q>check minus</q>.

            <h3>Participation: In Class and on the DH-ClassHub (15%):</h3>
            
            <p> Coding and programming in real life is a social activity, and professionals in
               the real world aren’t “know-it-all” experts who work alone, but rather are tuned
               into discussion boards and regularly ask and answer questions to stay sharp and to
               learn from their community. In this class, we want you to work together and talk
               to each other and your instructors as your community resource, so we have built
               this into our course participation grade as a formal expectation. <strong>Beginning by week two, we’ll expect each student to post at least once per
                  week on <a href="https://github.com/ebeshero/DHClass-Hub/issues">our course GitHub repo</a></strong>, and we strongly encourage you
               to do more than this minimum. Earn an <q>A</q> in participation by asking questions, making suggestions, and sharing helpful
               resources you’ve found. Help each other out by trying to answer questions on GitHub
               (and
               read the instructor posts too as we wade in to help). Your instructors will likely
               be dominating the class time as we model concepts and methods, so the GitHub Issues
               board gives the students a good space to form into a coding community to help each
               other and reflect together. Also, if you have a question about an assignment, <strong>always think of our GitHub Issues board as your first resource</strong> to
               check for helpful hints and to post your questions, because others may have the
               same question and answers are best shared! Of course you may e-mail us, but we
               really prefer you go the discussion board first, and doing so is, after all, worth
               course credit as your participation grade.
            </p>
            
            
            
            <h3>Tests (15%):</h3>
            
            <p>As scheduled throughout the course there will be several (probably about five or six)
               tests on the various kinds of coding we are learning in the course, and we will drop
               the lowest grade.  All but the first test will be take-home and assigned over a weekend.
               They are open-book, open notes, but they must be completed individually and are designed
               to demonstrate that you have learned from the class material, coding assignments,
               and posted solutions.  Tests may resemble homework assignments, but unlike homework
               exercises, these are given letter grades. These are given grades because they are
               evaluative and involve demonstrating what you have learned after we have finished
               a coding unit.
            </p>
            
            
            
            <h3>Project (40%):</h3>
            
            <p>Throughout the semester you will be working as part of a team on a course project.
               Early in the semester each student posts a proposal for a semester project to work
               with a text (or collection of texts) in the public domain and a set of research questions
               to explore in a coding project. Teams will form around a selection of these projects
               in mid-September and begin work, performing document analysis, developing and implementing
               a system of markup and project rules, marking up text following that system, writing
               programs to conduct research and create a resource to share on a public website you
               will develop together that represents your investigation and your conclusions. Each
               project team must meet regularly together and with a project mentor (one of the instructor
               team) outside of class for project planning and discussion. Each of the project components
               described below adds up to 40% of your grade for the course.
            </p> 
            
            <p><strong>Project Checkpoints</strong> There will be a series of project checkpoints to complete, by set due dates throughout
               the semester. Each is worth 5% of the final course grade (a total of 20%) and a letter
               grade on the following scale:  <q>exceeds target</q> (A+), <q>meets target</q> (A), <q>some progress</q> (B), <q>negligible progress</q> (C), <q>no progress</q>(F). Each checkpoint will expect you to complete a stage of serious work on the course
               project with your project team. Project Checkpoints are met using the Issues and/or
               Projects tabs on your project GitHub repository and by posting files on the project
               website on newtFire.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>The course project develops throughout the semester, but is fully assembled in the
               final weeks of the course and submitted in two places, through code and documentation
               shared in your GitHub repository and on your project website due in Finals Week. Projects
               are evaluated as a team effort, but if unequal effort is observed, project members
               may receive different project grades accordingly. The Final Project grade is worth
               20% of the course grade.
            </p>
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            <h3>Grading Scale:</h3>
            
            <p>Grades for the course are calcuated and posted on Courseweb, and follow this standard
               scale: A: 93-100%, A-:
               90-92%, B+: 87-89%, B: 83-86%, B-: 80-82%, C+: 77-79%, C: 73-76%, C-: 70-72%, D+:
               67-69%, D: 60-66%, F: 59% and below. In taking the course on a S / NC (pass-fail)
               basis, students must earn a C to receive Satisfactory credit. We give G grades
               (incomplete) at our discretion and only in conformity with the University Registrar
               policy: <a href="http://www.registrar.pitt.edu/grades.html">http://www.registrar.pitt.edu/grades.html</a>.

            <h2>Course Policies:</h2>
            
            <p>Each day we are covering material that builds on earlier material and assignments,
               so
               your success depends upon regular attendance and completing each assignment on
               time.
            </p>
            
            
            <h3>Attendance:</h3>
            
            <p> We strictly require your attendance, as it is not only a setback to yourself but
               to the entire class and the success of our projects if students are repeatedly
               absent. Students must attend at least 90% of our class meetings in order <strong>to pass</strong> the course (that is, a maximum of four absences for any reason). Late arrival—particularly
               a pattern of
               repeated late arrivals—may be counted as absences at our discretion. To be considered
               attending for a class period, you
               must be present in the classroom by the beginning of class and until class is
               dismissed. For your own sanity, do not miss two consecutive classes. If you are
               experiencing a genuine emergency or crisis, alert us and provide documentation.
               (We do not want you to attend class if you have a fever or flu-like symptoms! If
               you are a Greensburg student and wish to be excused from two or more consecutive class
               meetings due to your own
               documented illness, please contact one of the following: the Office of the Vice
               President for Academic Affairs, Prof. Jackie Horrall (724-836-7482 or jhorrall at
               pitt.edu), our Campus Health Center (Pamela Reed, 724-836-9947 or
               pmr20 at pitt.edu), or the Director of Counseling, Gayle Pamerleau (gaylep at
               pitt.edu), who can then officially alert all of your professors.
            </p>
            
            
            
            <h3>Deadlines:</h3>
            
            <p> Your daily homework for this course is time-sensitive! Coding assignments,
               response papers, and other homework exercises must be uploaded to CourseWeb (or to
               Box, or the Sandbox server as specified), by the date and time indicated by the
               instructors. Homework assignments will be posted online to our class website
               and linked from our schedule, so students who miss class are nevertheless expected
               to consult the schedule and submit assignments on time. Because we post and share
               answers to homework exercises after submission deadlines, we will not accept late
               homework submissions. In order to pass the course, students must submit at least
               90% of the regular homework assignments, and complete at least 90% of the work in
               each component of the course.
            </p>
            
            
            
            <h3>Exam Policy:</h3>
            
            <p> Similarly, because we will be posting answers or sharing them in class, we do not
               give make-up examinations or allow people to write exams after the solutions are posted.
               However, we will drop your lowest exam score for
               the class, so that you may miss one exam without penalty.
            </p>
            
            
            
            <h3>Classroom Courtesy:</h3>
            
            <p>Our class is fast paced, and requires that we all be making the best use we can of
               our in-person class sessions. Arriving late and leaving early disrupts the
               important collective mental activity of class. So does in-class texting and
               checking your cell phone. While class is in progress, talking disruptively,
               leaving the classroom, texting or using a cell phone or computer, reading a
               newspaper, or other distracting behavior will be actively discouraged, and may
               result in a deduction in your Participation grade. Please respect what we do in
               the classroom: attend class regularly, and come prepared to contribute your
               questions and ideas.
            </p>
            
            
            
            <h3>E-mail:</h3>
            
            <p>Each student is issued a University email address (username@pitt.edu) upon
               admission. This email address may be used by the University for official
               communication with students. Students are expected to read email sent to this
               account on a regular basis. Failure to read and react to University communications
               in a timely manner does not absolve the student from knowing and complying with
               the content of the communications. The University provides an email forwarding
               service that allows students to read their email via other service providers
               (e.g., Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo). Students who choose to forward their email from their
               pitt.edu address to another address do so at their own risk. If email is lost as a
               result of forwarding, it does not absolve the student from responding to official
               communications sent to their University email address. To forward email sent to
               your University account, go to http://accounts.pitt.edu, log into your account,
               click on Edit Forwarding Addresses, and follow the instructions on the page. Be
               sure to log out of your account when you have finished. (For the full Email
               Communication Policy, go to <a href="http://www.bc.pitt.edu/policies/policy/09/09-10-01.html">http://www.bc.pitt.edu/policies/policy/09/09-10-01.html</a>.)

            <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
            
            <p>
               <strong>Source Citation and Plagiarism:</strong> One goal of our course is to
               reflect on how best to cite sources in digital contexts. We will consider how and
               why such citations differ from documenting printed texts. We will also consider
               the ease and frequency with which digital texts and graphics are plagiarized on
               the worldwide web, and discuss how the omission of source citations detracts from
               the authority of a digital information resource. We expect you to practice mindful
               source citation, and plagiarism on your part will have very serious
               consequences.
            </p>
            
            <p>Representing the voice
               of another individual as your own voice constitutes plagiarism, however generous
               that person may be in “helping” you with an assignment. Turning in an assignment
               generated collectively under the name of a single individual is considered
               plagiarism. <strong>When instructed to collaborate on a project, project
                  collaborators share collective authorship and should identify themselves
                  directly as a team.</strong> To avoid plagiarism, cite your sources whenever you
               quote, paraphrase, or summarize material, or use digital images from any outside
               source (including websites, articles, books, course readings, Courseweb or GitHub
               postings,
               or someone else’s notes). When using the “copy” and “paste” features as you read
               and research, be sure that you are carefully marking that these passages are
               unprocessed from their source, so that you know to process it later. Forgetting to
               do so not only produces sloppy work but (whether you intended it or not) results
               in a false representation. As long as you make a good faith and clear effort to
               cite your sources, you will not be faulted for plagiarism, but your work will be
               penalized if citations are inaccurate, unclear, or lack important information.
            </p>
            
            <p>That said, the coding and digital development we do encourages collaboration, and
               for that reason we adopt our colleague David Birnbaum's <a href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/collaboration.xhtml">Collaboration policy</a>, which specifies that students identify collaborators in a comment on submitted asignments
               and take care on projects that all students contribute equally (and no student is
               contributing excessively more than what everyone else has done). When joining a group
               homework session, always work on the assignment by yourself first so you can be an
               equal participant, and write up the assignment <em>by yourself, after</em> the session is over so you take care not to copy from the other students. While we
               want you to consult with each other, you are responsible for doing all your writing
               and coding by yourself, using your own words.
            </p>
            
            
            
            <p>Plagiarism falsely represents another source’s words or ideas as your own, and, if
               you commit plagiarism in this course, you will receive a final course grade of F
               and, at Greensburg campus, be reported to the Vice President for Academic Affairs.
               At Greensburg campus, cheating on exams or exercises will also receive a final course
               grade of F and
               will be reported to the Vice President for Academic Affairs.
            </p>  
            <p>All Pitt students and instructors (from Pittsburgh and Greensburg) are required to
               observe <a href="https://as.pitt.edu/faculty/policies-and-procedures/academic-integrity-code">the Dietrich School Academic Integrity guidelines</a>, and violations of the Academic Integrity Code will be addressed according to those
               guidelines.
