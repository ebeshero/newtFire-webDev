            <head>Coding and Digital Archives: Course Description</head>
            <p>This course is all about doing interesting things with texts using computers and
               digital technology to build cultural resources on the public web. <!--Your professors are researchers of literature and anthropology,
               not computer programmers, and we teach this course based on our experience with
               collaborating on digital humanities projects, some of which you may find on <ref
                  target="newtfire.org">http://newtfire.org</ref>. -->We will work with many kinds of texts: looking at manuscript images, plain text documents, and structured documents like poems, novels, voyage logs, and plays, and learn how to transform and remix them in ways we can share on the public web and study with computer tools that we design for
               ourselves, based on the questions we ask. We work with computers in this course as
               precision instruments that help us to read and process great quantities of
               information, and that lead us to make significant connections, ask new kinds of
               questions, and design web resources for people curious about human history, culture, and creativity.</p>
            <p>Our class is one of the core courses of <ref target="http://greensburg.pitt.edu/academics/info/digital-studies">Pitt-Greensburg’s Digital Studies Certificate</ref>, and it satisifes a range of
               general education requirements in quantitative reasoning,
               behavioral sciences, and humanities. That is because this course is distinctively
               interdisciplinary in engaging formal and
               quantitative reasoning through computer coding in ways that matter to students in
               humanities and social sciences who are not training to be computer scientists.
               Students gain hands-on experience in this course with applying computer coding to
               represent and investigate cultural materials. As we design projects together, you
               will gain practical experience in editing and you will certainly fine-tune your
               precision in writing and thinking.  We will do all of this with
               an eye to your understanding how coding works in an openly collaborative environment, with an emphasis on building sustainable and freely accessible resources on the public web.</p>

            <p>Students who complete this course will gain skills in digital project management and
               web development, and their digital projects will distinguish them as investigators
               and makers, able to wield computers creatively and effectively for human interests.
               Your success will require patience, dedication, and regular communication and
               interaction with us, working through assignments on a daily basis. Your success will
               NOT require perfection, but rather your regular efforts throughout the course, your
               documenting of problems when your coding doesn’t yield the results you want. Homework
               exercises are a back-and-forth, intensive dialogue between you and your instructors,
               and we plan to spend a great deal of time with you individually over these as we work
               together. Our guiding principle in developing assignments and working with you is
               that the best way for you to learn and succeed is through regular practice as you
               hone your skills. Our goal is not to make you expert programmers (as we are far from
               that ourselves). Instead, we want you to learn how to apply coding technologies for
               your own purposes, how to track down answers to questions, how to think your way
               algorithmically (step-by-step) through problems to find good solutions.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="description" style="main"><head>Survey of Coding Technologies Covered:</head>
            <p> We will be working primarily with eXtensible Markup Language (XML) because it is a
               powerful tool for modelling texts that we can adapt creatively to our interests and
               questions. XML represents a standard in adaptability and human-readability in digital
               code, and it works together with related technologies with which you will gain
               working experience: You’ll learn how to write XPath expressions: a formal language
               for searching and extracting information from XML code which serves as the basis for
               transforming XML into many publishable forms. You’ll learn to
               write XSLT: a programming “stylesheet” transforming language designed to convert XML
               to publishable formats, as well as to
               extract information and plot it in charts in graphs in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). You will learn how to
               design your own systematic coding methods to work on projects, and how to write your
               own rules in schema languages (like Schematron and Relax-NG) to keep your projects
               organized and prevent errors. You’ll gain experience with an international XML
               language called TEI (after the Text Encoding Initiative) which serves as the
               international standard for coding digital archives of cultural materials. Since one
               of the best and most widely accessible ways to publish XML is on the worldwide web,
               you’ll gain working experience with HTML code (a markup language that is a kind of
               XML), styling HTML with Cascading Stylesheets (CSS), and adding dynamic features to your website with JavaScript.</p>

               <p>Regular homework exercises are key to the active learning process in this course.
                  Each day will involve some small assignment, building to the larger course
                  projects. Students must complete (on time) at least 90% of each homework component
                  (coding assignments, short response papers, blog postings and responses, in order
                  to pass the course. For students who complete the 90% requirement, the homework
                  taken all together, is worth 35% of your course grade.</p>

                     <hi rend="em">Coding assignments:</hi> These are assignments you’ll complete by
                     writing code to achieve a specified result by applying a coding method you are
                     learning. Often, there will be multiple ways of accomplishing the task. You
                     will receive lots of feedback from us, in the form of posted results and
                     individual commentary on your assignments as needed. If you don’t achieve the
                     result you want, you may still receive full credit so long as you have made a
                     serious attempt to describe your process, what else you tried, what results you
                     expected vs. what results you got, and what you think went wrong. Documenting
                     problems is key to the learning process, and sometimes the documentation
                     process helps lead you to the solution and always helps your learning
                     process.</p>

                     <hi rend="em">Short writing assignments:</hi> We’ll assign short writing assignments in which you will respond to online readings or evaluate web projects and resources. These will usually take the form of postings on our class GitHub site. Your posting should do more than
                     summarize the article or site (which you could just do by skimming or reading
                     the first paragraph), but should demonstrate a thoughtful reflection on
                     specific ideas and issues. When evaluating a web resource, don’t simply praise
                     or condemn it without going into details about why a key component is effective
                     or poorly designed. Good posts demonstrate care and reflection, and
                     you may choose to respond to the overarching ideas of a piece, or to selected
                     details of specific interest. </p>

                     course projects in teams, we expect that each team (not each individual
                     student) will post a project update, usually by Friday of a given week. These
                     postings should be brief status reports about your project work: what you’ve
                     accomplished in the preceding week, what problems you’re facing, what you’ve
                     been learning, resources you’ve been discussing, and should conclude by

                     following the team project posts). These responses can be brief but for credit
                     (and to be useful) they need to be thoughtful: something more than "good work!"
                     or “very interesting!” Respond to something specific in teh blog: make a
                     suggestion, offer a critique, ask or answer a question, discuss how something
                     in the blog post gave you an idea for your project, share a resource you’ve

               <p> Coding and programming in real life is a social activity, and professionals in
                  the real world aren’t “know-it-all” experts who work alone, but rather are tuned
                  into discussion boards and regularly ask and answer questions to stay sharp and to
                  learn from their community. In this class, we want you to work together and talk
                  to each other and your instructors as your community resource, so we have built
                  this into our course participation grade as a formal expectation. <hi rend="em">Beginning by week two, we’ll expect each student to post at least once per
                     week on our online class discussion board</hi>, and we strongly encourage you
                  to do more than this minimum. Ask questions, make suggestions, share helpful
                  resources you’ve found. Help each other out by trying to answer questions (and
                  read the instructor posts too as we wade in to help). Your instructors will likely
                  be dominating the class time as we model concepts and methods, so the discussion
                  boards give you all a good space to form into a coding community to help each
                  other and reflect together. Also, if you have a question about an assignment, <hi rend="em">always think of the discussion board as your first resource</hi> to
                  check for helpful hints and to post your questions, because others may have the
                  same question and answers are best shared! Of course you may e-mail us, but we
                  really prefer you go the discussion board first, and doing so is, after all, worth
                  course credit as your participation grade.</p>

               <head>Quizzes and Tests (15%):</head>
               <p>As scheduled throughout the course there will be several (probably about six to
                  eight) short quizzes and tests that will take roughly half of the class period
                  time. These will ask you to demonstrate your knowledge of coding practices and
                  vocabulary learned in an immediately preceding portion of the course. We will drop
                  your lowest two scores on these exams. (No make-up exams are given: see course

               <head>Project (35%):</head>
               <p> Within the first three weeks of the course, we will familiarize you with some of
                  our ongoing projects and their associated research questions. You will be working in teams
                  to contribute to these ongoing projects, to develop a site of your own designed to
                  enhance these projects or take them in a new direction. The direction you take
                  will be partly shaped by you in conversation with the instructors.
                  <!--We will also assign you to
                  propose a project based on a text or set of texts that interest you and suggest a
                  promising research question to explore with our coding methods, and we’ll respond
                  to these to help you refine your ideas. We’ll ask you all to read each other’s
                  refined proposals, and the class as a whole (working with the instructors) will
                  select which of these we want to pursue through the term, and form groups to begin
                  work.-->
                  Development of the project will involve doing a careful document analysis,
                  developing a coding plan and rules to follow, coding your text(s), and developing
                  programs to address your research question. It will also involve designing a
                  project site to represent your research questions, the texts and your processing
                  of them, as well as to share your coding scripts and to reflect on the results of
                  your investigation. We will post milestones you must meet for the projects
                  throughout the term. Project teams must meet 90% of the project milestone due
                  dates in order to receive a passing grade. It is expected that project teams meet
                  regularly (each week), check in with the instructors, and delegate tasks to each
                  other. Reporting on project progress is required as part of the regular homework
                  assignments for the course. Teams are encouraged to meet with us instructors
                  during (or outside) our scheduled office hours. In the last few weeks of the
                  course, almost all of your course work outside class will be devoted to project
                  development, applying the methods you’ve been learning across the semester.</p>

                  in a timely manner does not absolve the student from knowing and complying with

                  <hi rend="em">Source Citation and Plagiarism:</hi> One goal of our course is to
                  reflect on how best to cite sources in digital contexts. We will consider how and
                  why such citations differ from documenting printed texts. We will also consider
                  the ease and frequency with which digital texts and graphics are plagiarized on
                  the worldwide web, and discuss how the omission of source citations detracts from
                  the authority of a digital information resource. We expect you to practice mindful
                  source citation, and plagiarism on your part will have very serious
                  consequences.</p>
               <p>Plagiarism falsely represents another source’s words or ideas as your own, and, if
                  you commit plagiarism in this course, you will receive a final course grade of F
                  and be reported to the Vice President of Academic Affairs. Representing the voice
                  of another individual as your own voice constitutes plagiarism, however generous
                  that person may be in “helping” you with an assignment. Turning in an assignment
                  generated collectively under the name of a single individual is considered
                  plagiarism. <hi rend="em">When instructed to collaborate on a project, project
                     collaborators share collective authorship and should identify themselves
                     directly as a team.</hi> To avoid plagiarism, cite your sources whenever you
                  quote, paraphrase, or summarize material, or use digital images from any outside
                  source (including websites, articles, books, course readings, Courseweb postings,
                  or someone else’s notes). When using the “copy” and “paste” features as you read
                  and research, be sure that you are carefully marking that these passages are
                  unprocessed from their source, so that you know to process it later. Forgetting to
                  do so not only produces sloppy work but (whether you intended it or not) results
                  in a false representation. As long as you make a good faith and clear effort to
                  cite your sources, you will not be faulted for plagiarism, but your work will be
                  penalized if citations are inaccurate, unclear, or lack important information.
                  Cheating on exams or exercises will also receive a final course grade of F and
                  will be reported to the Vice President of Academic Affairs.</p>

                     complete XML file in a way that makes sense to organize the information in the recipe (giving it a name, classifying the ingredients, etc), and

                            digital humanities projects—it was our starting point and first
                            collaboration with students. The Voyage Maps area got us involved with using maps to represent passages from voyage logs, but the project could use an overhaul to pick up loose ends or continue where we left off a few years ago, and we could move it to our development space at the Supercomputing Center to be with our other projects.</item></list>
