      <h1>Sonnets</h1>
      <h2>Sonnet I</h2>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">1 </span>From fairest creatures we desire increase, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">2 </span>That thereby beauty's rose might never die, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">3 </span>But as the riper should by time decease, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">4 </span>His tender heir might bear his memory: </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">5 </span>But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">6 </span>Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">7 </span>Making a famine where abundance lies, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">8 </span>Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel: </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">9 </span>Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">10 </span>And only herald to the gaudy spring, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">11 </span>Within thine own bud buriest thy content, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">12 </span>And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding: </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">13 </span>Pity the world, or else this glutton be, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">14 </span>To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee. </p>
      <h2>Sonnet II</h2>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">1 </span>When forty winters shall besiege thy brow, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">2 </span>And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">3 </span>Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">4 </span>Will be a tatter'd weed of small worth held: </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">5 </span>Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">6 </span>Where all the treasure of thy lusty days; </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">7 </span>To say, within thine own deep sunken eyes, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">8 </span>Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise. </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">9 </span>How much more praise deserv'd thy beauty's use, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">10 </span>If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">11 </span>Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse,' </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">12 </span>Proving his beauty by succession thine! </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">13 </span>This were to be new made when thou art old, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">14 </span>And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold. </p>
      <h2>Sonnet III</h2>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">1 </span>Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">2 </span>Now is the time that face should form another; </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">3 </span>Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">4 </span>Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother. </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">5 </span>For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">6 </span>Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry? </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">7 </span>Or who is he so fond will be the tomb, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">8 </span>Of his self-love to stop posterity? </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">9 </span>Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">10 </span>Calls back the lovely April of her prime; </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">11 </span>So thou through windows of thine age shalt see, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">12 </span>Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time. </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">13 </span>But if thou live, remember'd not to be, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">14 </span>Die single and thine image dies with thee. </p>
      <h2>Sonnet IV</h2>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">1 </span>Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">2 </span>Upon thy self thy beauty's legacy? </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">3 </span>Nature's bequest gives nothing, but doth lend, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">4 </span>And being frank she lends to those are free: </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">5 </span>Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">6 </span>The bounteous largess given thee to give? </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">7 </span>Profitless usurer, why dost thou use </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">8 </span>So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live? </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">9 </span>For having traffic with thy self alone, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">10 </span>Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive: </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">11 </span>Then how when nature calls thee to be gone, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">12 </span>What acceptable audit canst thou leave? </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">13 </span>Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">14 </span>Which, used, lives th' executor to be. </p>
      <h2>Sonnet V</h2>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">1 </span>Those hours, that with gentle work did frame </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">2 </span>The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">3 </span>Will play the tyrants to the very same </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">4 </span>And that unfair which fairly doth excel; </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">5 </span>For never-resting time leads summer on </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">6 </span>To hideous winter, and confounds him there; </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">7 </span>Sap checked with frost, and lusty leaves quite gone, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">8 </span>Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where: </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">9 </span>Then were not summer's distillation left, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">10 </span>A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">11 </span>Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">12 </span>Nor it, nor no remembrance what it was: </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">13 </span>But flowers distill'd, though they with winter meet, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">14 </span>Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet. </p>
      <h2>Sonnet VI</h2>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">1 </span>Then let not winter's ragged hand deface, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">2 </span>In thee thy summer, ere thou be distill'd: </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">3 </span>Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">4 </span>With beauty's treasure ere it be self-kill'd. </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">5 </span>That use is not forbidden usury, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">6 </span>Which happies those that pay the willing loan; </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">7 </span>That's for thy self to breed another thee, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">8 </span>Or ten times happier, be it ten for one; </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">9 </span>Ten times thy self were happier than thou art, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">10 </span>If ten of thine ten times refigur'd thee: </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">11 </span>Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">12 </span>Leaving thee living in posterity? </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">13 </span>Be not self-will'd, for thou art much too fair </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">14 </span>To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir. </p>
      <h2>Sonnet VII</h2>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">1 </span>Lo! in the orient when the gracious light </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">2 </span>Lifts up his burning head, each under eye </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">3 </span>Doth homage to his new-appearing sight, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">4 </span>Serving with looks his sacred majesty; </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">5 </span>And having climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">6 </span>Resembling strong youth in his middle age, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">7 </span>Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">8 </span>Attending on his golden pilgrimage: </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">9 </span>But when from highmost pitch, with weary car, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">10 </span>Like feeble age, he reeleth from the day, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">11 </span>The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">12 </span>From his low tract, and look another way: </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">13 </span>So thou, thyself outgoing in thy noon: </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">14 </span>Unlook'd, on diest unless thou get a son. </p>
      <h2>Sonnet VIII</h2>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">1 </span>Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly? </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">2 </span>Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy: </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">3 </span>Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">4 </span>Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy? </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">5 </span>If the true concord of well-tuned sounds, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">6 </span>By unions married, do offend thine ear, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">7 </span>They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">8 </span>In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear. </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">9 </span>Mark how one string, sweet husband to another, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">10 </span>Strikes each in each by mutual ordering; </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">11 </span>Resembling sire and child and happy mother, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">12 </span>Who, all in one, one pleasing note do sing: </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">13 </span>Whose speechless song being many, seeming one, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">14 </span>Sings this to thee: 'Thou single wilt prove none.' </p>
      <h2>Sonnet IX</h2>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">1 </span>Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">2 </span>That thou consum'st thy self in single life? </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">3 </span>Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">4 </span>The world will wail thee like a makeless wife; </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">5 </span>The world will be thy widow and still weep </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">6 </span>That thou no form of thee hast left behind, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">7 </span>When every private widow well may keep </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">8 </span>By children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind: </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">9 </span>Look! what an unthrift in the world doth spend </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">10 </span>Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it; </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">11 </span>But beauty's waste hath in the world an end, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">12 </span>And kept unused the user so destroys it. </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">13 </span>No love toward others in that bosom sits </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">14 </span>That on himself such murd'rous shame commits. </p>
      <h2>Sonnet X</h2>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">1 </span>For shame! deny that thou bear'st love to any, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">2 </span>Who for thy self art so unprovident. </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">3 </span>Grant, if thou wilt, thou art belov'd of many, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">4 </span>But that thou none lov'st is most evident: </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">5 </span>For thou art so possess'd with murderous hate, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">6 </span>That 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">7 </span>Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">8 </span>Which to repair should be thy chief desire. </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">9 </span>O! change thy thought, that I may change my mind: </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">10 </span>Shall hate be fairer lodg'd than gentle love? </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">11 </span>Be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">12 </span>Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove: </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">13 </span>Make thee another self for love of me, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">14 </span>That beauty still may live in thine or thee. </p>
      <h2>Sonnet XI</h2>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">1 </span>As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou grow'st, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">2 </span>In one of thine, from that which thou departest; </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">3 </span>And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">4 </span>Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">5 </span>Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase; </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">6 </span>Without this folly, age, and cold decay: </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">7 </span>If all were minded so, the times should cease </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">8 </span>And threescore year would make the world away. </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">9 </span>Let those whom nature hath not made for store, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">10 </span>Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish: </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">11 </span>Look, whom she best endow'd, she gave thee more; </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">12 </span>Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish: </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">13 </span>She carv'd thee for her seal, and meant thereby, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">14 </span>Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die. </p>
      <h2>Sonnet XII</h2>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">1 </span>When I do count the clock that tells the time, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">2 </span>And see the brave day sunk in hideous night; </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">3 </span>When I behold the violet past prime, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">4 </span>And sable curls, all silvered o'er with white; </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">5 </span>When lofty trees I see barren of leaves, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">6 </span>Which erst from heat did canopy the herd, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">7 </span>And summer's green all girded up in sheaves, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">8 </span>Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">9 </span>Then of thy beauty do I question make, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">10 </span>That thou among the wastes of time must go, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">11 </span>Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">12 </span>And die as fast as they see others grow; </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">13 </span>And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">14 </span>Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence. </p>
      <h2>Sonnet XIII</h2>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">1 </span>O! that you were your self; but, love you are </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">2 </span>No longer yours, than you your self here live: </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">3 </span>Against this coming end you should prepare, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">4 </span>And your sweet semblance to some other give: </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">5 </span>So should that beauty which you hold in lease </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">6 </span>Find no determination; then you were </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">7 </span>Yourself again, after yourself's decease, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">8 </span>When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear. </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">9 </span>Who lets so fair a house fall to decay, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">10 </span>Which husbandry in honour might uphold, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">11 </span>Against the stormy gusts of winter's day </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">12 </span>And barren rage of death's eternal cold? </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">13 </span>O! none but unthrifts. Dear my love, you know, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">14 </span>You had a father: let your son say so. </p>
      <h2>Sonnet XIV</h2>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">1 </span>Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck; </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">2 </span>And yet methinks I have astronomy, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">3 </span>But not to tell of good or evil luck, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">4 </span>Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality; </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">5 </span>Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">6 </span>Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">7 </span>Or say with princes if it shall go well </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">8 </span>By oft predict that I in heaven find: </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">9 </span>But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">10 </span>And constant stars in them I read such art </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">11 </span>As 'Truth and beauty shall together thrive, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">12 </span>If from thyself, to store thou wouldst convert'; </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">13 </span>Or else of thee this I prognosticate: </p>
      <h2>Sonnet XV</h2>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">1 </span>When I consider every thing that grows </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">2 </span>Holds in perfection but a little moment, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">3 </span>That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">4 </span>Whereon the stars in secret influence comment; </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">5 </span>When I perceive that men as plants increase, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">6 </span>Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">7 </span>Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">8 </span>And wear their brave state out of memory; </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">9 </span>Then the conceit of this inconstant stay </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">10 </span>Sets you most rich in youth before my sight, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">11 </span>Where wasteful Time debateth with decay </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">12 </span>To change your day of youth to sullied night, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">13 </span>And all in war with Time for love of you, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">14 </span>As he takes from you, I engraft you new. </p>
      <h2>Sonnet XVI</h2>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">1 </span>But wherefore do not you a mightier way </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">2 </span>Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time? </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">3 </span>And fortify your self in your decay </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">4 </span>With means more blessed than my barren rhyme? </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">5 </span>Now stand you on the top of happy hours, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">6 </span>And many maiden gardens, yet unset, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">7 </span>With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">8 </span>Much liker than your painted counterfeit: </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">9 </span>So should the lines of life that life repair, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">10 </span>Which this, Time's pencil, or my pupil pen, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">11 </span>Neither in inward worth nor outward fair, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">12 </span>Can make you live your self in eyes of men. </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">13 </span>To give away yourself, keeps yourself still, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">14 </span>And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill. </p>
      <h2>Sonnet XVII</h2>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">1 </span>Who will believe my verse in time to come, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">2 </span>If it were fill'd with your most high deserts? </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">3 </span>Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">4 </span>Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts. </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">5 </span>If I could write the beauty of your eyes, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">6 </span>And in fresh numbers number all your graces, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">7 </span>The age to come would say 'This poet lies; </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">8 </span>Such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.' </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">9 </span>So should my papers, yellow'd with their age, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">10 </span>Be scorn'd, like old men of less truth than tongue, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">11 </span>And your true rights be term'd a poet's rage </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">12 </span>And stretched metre of an antique song: </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">13 </span>But were some child of yours alive that time, </p>
      <p><span class="lineNumber">14 </span>You should live twice,--in it, and in my rhyme. </p>
