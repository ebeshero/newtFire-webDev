		<chapterHead>CHAPTER I - Looking-Glass house</chapterHead>
		<p>One thing was certain, that the <person ref="wk">WHITE kitten</person> had had nothing to
			do with it:--it was the <person ref="bk">black kitten</person>'s fault entirely. For the
				<person ref="wk">white kitten</person> had been having its face washed by the old
				<person ref="dinah">cat</person> for the last quarter of an hour (<litDev
				type="exposition">and bearing it pretty well, considering</litDev>); so <person
				ref="reader">you</person> see that it COULDN'T have had any hand in the
			mischief.</p>
		<p>The way <person ref="dinah">Dinah</person> washed <person ref="dinah">her</person>
			children's faces was this: first <person ref="dinah">she</person> held the poor thing
			down by its ear with one paw, and then with the other paw <person ref="dinah"
				>she</person> rubbed its face all over, the wrong way, beginning at the nose: and
			just now, as <person ref="author">I</person> said, <person ref="dinah">she</person> was
			hard at work on the <person ref="wk">white kitten</person>, which was lying quite still
			and trying to purr--no doubt feeling that it was all meant for <person ref="wk"
				>its</person> good.</p>
		<p>But the <person ref="bk">black kitten</person> had been finished with earlier in the
			afternoon, and so, while <person ref="alice">Alice</person> was sitting curled up in a
			corner of the great arm-chair, half talking to <person ref="alice">herself</person> and
			half asleep, the kitten had been having a grand game of romps with the ball of worsted
				<person ref="alice">Alice</person> had been trying to wind up, and had been rolling
			it up and down till it had all come undone again; and there it was, spread over the
			hearth-rug, all knots and tangles, with the kitten running after its own tail in the
			middle.</p>
		<p><q sp="alice"><litDev type="apost">Oh, <person ref="bk">you</person> wicked little
					thing!</litDev><litDev type="apost">Really, <person ref="dinah">Dinah</person>
					ought to have taught <person ref="bk">you</person> better manners! <person
						ref="dinah">you</person> OUGHT, <person ref="dinah">Dinah</person>, <person
						ref="dinah">you</person> know <person ref="dinah">you</person>
					ought!</litDev></q>
			<person ref="alice">she</person> added, looking reproachfully at the old <person
				ref="dinah">cat</person>, and speaking in as cross a voice as <person ref="alice"
				>she</person> could manage--and then <person ref="alice">she</person> scrambled back
			into the arm-chair, taking the <person ref="bk">kitten</person> and the worsted with
				<person ref="alice">her</person>, and began winding up the ball again. But <person
				ref="alice">she</person> didn't get on very fast, as <person ref="alice"
				>she</person> was talking all the time, sometimes to the kitten, and sometimes to
				<person ref="alice">herself</person>. <person ref="bk">Kitty</person> sat very
			demurely on <person ref="alice">her</person> knee, pretending to watch the progress of
			the winding, and now and then putting out one paw and gently touching the ball, as if it
			would be glad to help, if it might.</p>
		<p><q sp="alice"><litDev type="apost">Do <person ref="bk">you</person> know what to-morrow
					is, <person ref="bk">Kitty</person>?<litDev/><litDev/><person ref="bk"
						>you</person>'d have guessed if <person ref="bk">you</person>'d been up in
					the window with me--only <person ref="dinah">Dinah</person> was making <person
						ref="bk">you</person> tidy, so <person ref="bk">you</person> couldn't.
						<person ref="alice">I</person> was watching the boys getting in sticks for
					the bonfire--and it wants plenty of sticks, <person ref="bk">Kitty</person>!
					Only it got so cold, and it snowed so, they had to leave off. Never mind,
						<person ref="bk">Kitty</person>, <person ref="alice bk">we</person>'ll go
					and see the bonfire to-morrow.</litDev></q> Here <person ref="alice"
				>Alice</person> wound two or three turns of the worsted round the kitten's neck,
			just to see how it would look: this led to a scramble, in which the ball rolled down
			upon the floor, and yards and yards of it got unwound again.</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="alice">
				<litDev type="apost">Do <person ref="bk">you</person> know, <person ref="alice"
						>I</person> was so angry, <person ref="bk"
					>Kitty</person>,<litDev/><litDev/>when <person ref="alice">I</person> saw all
					the mischief <person ref="bk">you</person> had been doing, <person ref="alice"
						>I</person> was very nearly opening the window, and putting <person ref="bk"
						>you</person> out into the snow! And <person ref="bk">you</person>'d have
					deserved it, <person ref="bk">you</person> little mischievous darling! What have
						<person ref="bk">you</person> got to say for <person ref="bk"
						>yourself</person>? Now don't interrupt me!<litDev/><litDev/><person
						ref="alice">I</person>'m going to tell <person ref="bk">you</person> all
						<person ref="bk">your</person> faults. Number one: <person ref="bk"
						>you</person> squeaked twice while <person ref="dinah">Dinah</person> was
					washing <person ref="bk">your</person> face this morning. Now <person ref="bk"
						>you</person> can't deny it, <person ref="bk">Kitty</person>: <person
						ref="alice">I</person> heard <person ref="bk">you</person>! What's that
						<person ref="bk">you</person> say?<litDev/><litDev/><person ref="dinah"
						>her</person> paw went into <person ref="bk">your</person> eye? Well, that's
						<person ref="bk">your</person> fault, for keeping <person ref="bk"
						>your</person> eyes open--if <person ref="bk">you</person>'d shut them tight
					up, it wouldn't have happened. Now don't make any more excuses, but listen!
					Number two: <person ref="bk">you</person> pulled <person ref="wk"
						>Snowdrop</person> away by the tail just as <person ref="alice">I</person>
					had put down the saucer of milk before <person ref="wk">her</person>! What,
						<person ref="bk">you</person> were thirsty, were <person ref="bk"
						>you</person>? How do <person ref="bk">you</person> know <person ref="wk"
						>she</person> wasn't thirsty too? Now for number three: <person ref="bk"
						>you</person> unwound every bit of the worsted while <person ref="alice"
						>I</person> wasn't looking!</litDev>
			</q>
		</p>
		<p><q sp="alice"><litDev type="apost">That's three faults, <person ref="bk">Kitty</person>,
					and <person ref="bk">you</person>'ve not been punished for any of them yet.
						<person ref="bk">you</person> know <person ref="alice">I</person>'m saving
					up all <person ref="bk">your</person> punishments for Wednesday week--Suppose
					they had saved up all <person ref="alice">MY</person> punishments!</litDev></q>
			<person ref="alice">she</person> went on, talking more to <person ref="alice"
				>herself</person> than the kitten.<q sp="alice">What WOULD <person ref="family"
					>they</person> do at the end of a year? <person ref="alice">I</person> should be
				sent to prison, <person ref="alice">I</person> suppose, when the day came. Or--let
				me see--suppose each punishment was to be going without a dinner: then, when the
				miserable day came, <person ref="alice">I</person> should have to go without fifty
				dinners at once! Well, <person ref="alice">I</person> shouldn't mind THAT much!
					<person ref="alice">I</person>'d far rather go without them than eat
			them!</q></p>
		<p>
			<q sp="alice"><litDev type="apost"/>Do <person ref="bk">you</person> hear the snow
				against the window-panes, <person ref="bk">Kitty</person>? How nice and soft it
				sounds! Just as if some one was kissing the window all over outside. <litDev
					type="personification"><person ref="alice">I</person> wonder if the snow LOVES
					the trees and fields, that it kisses them so gently? And then it covers them up
					snug, <person ref="bk">you</person> know, with a white quilt; and perhaps it
					says, "Go to sleep, darlings, till the summer comes again." And when they wake
					up in the summer, <person ref="bk">Kitty</person>, they dress themselves all in
					green, and dance about--whenever the wind blows--oh, that's very
					pretty!<litDev/><litDev/>And <person ref="alice">I</person> do so WISH it was
					true! <person ref="alice">I</person>'m sure the woods look sleepy in the autumn,
					when the leaves are getting brown.</litDev></q>
		</p>
		<p><q sp="alice"><litDev type="apost"><person ref="bk">Kitty</person>, can <person ref="bk"
						>you</person> play chess? Now, don't smile, <person ref="alice">my</person>
					dear, <person ref="alice">I</person>'m asking it seriously. Because, when
						<person ref="alice bk">we</person> were playing just now, <person ref="bk"
						>you</person> watched just as if <person ref="bk">you</person> understood
					it: and when <person ref="alice">I</person> said "Check!" <person ref="bk"
						>you</person> purred! Well, it WAS a nice check, <person ref="bk"
						>Kitty</person>, and really <person ref="alice">I</person> might have won,
					if it hadn't been for that nasty Knight, that came wiggling down among <person
						ref="alice">my</person> pieces. <person ref="bk">Kitty</person>, dear, let's
					pretend--</litDev></q> And here <person ref="author">I</person> wish <person
				ref="author">I</person> could tell <person ref="reader">you</person> half the things
				<person ref="alice">Alice</person> used to say, beginning with <person ref="alice"
				>her</person> favourite phrase"Let's pretend." <person ref="alice">She</person> had
			had quite a long argument with <person ref="alice">her</person>
			<person ref="sis">sister</person> only the day before --all because <person ref="alice"
				>Alice</person> had begun with <q sp="alice">Let's pretend <person ref="alice sis"
					>we</person>'re kings and queens;</q> and <person ref="alice">her</person>
			<person ref="sis">sister</person>, who liked being very exact, had argued that <person
				ref="alice sis">they</person> couldn't, because there were only two of <person
				ref="alice sis">them</person>, and <person ref="alice">Alice</person> had been
			reduced at last to say, <q sp="alice">Well, <person ref="sis">you</person> can be one of
				them then, and <person ref="alice">I</person>'LL be all the rest.</q> And once
				<person ref="alice">she</person> had really frightened <person ref="alice"
				>her</person> old <person ref="nurse">nurse</person> by shouting suddenly in <person
				ref="nurse">her</person> ear, <q sp="alice"><person ref="nurse">Nurse</person>! Do
				let's pretend that <person ref="alice">I</person>'m a hungry hyaena, and <person
					ref="nurse">you</person>'re a bone.</q></p>
		<p>But this is taking <person ref="reader author">us</person> away from <person ref="alice"
				>Alice</person>'s speech to the kitten. <q sp="alice"><litDev type="apost">Let's
					pretend that <person ref="bk">you</person>'re the <person ref="redQueen">Red
						Queen</person>, <person ref="bk">Kitty</person>! Do <person ref="bk"
						>you</person> know, <person ref="alice">I</person> think if <person ref="bk"
						>you</person> sat up and folded <person ref="bk">your</person> arms, <person
						ref="bk">you</person>'d look exactly like <person ref="redQueen"
						>her</person>. Now do try, there's a dear!</litDev></q> And <person
				ref="alice">Alice</person> got the <person ref="redQueen">Red Queen</person> off the
			table, and set it up before the kitten as a model for it to imitate: however, the thing
			didn't succeed, principally, <person ref="alice">Alice</person> said, because the kitten
			wouldn't fold its arms properly. So, to punish it, <person ref="alice">she</person> held
			it up to the Looking-glass, that it might see how sulky it was--<q sp="alice"><litDev
					type="apost">and if <person ref="bk">you</person>'re not good
						directly,<litDev/><litDev/><person ref="alice">I</person>person>'ll put
						<person ref="bk">you</person> through into Looking-glass House. How would
						<person ref="bk">you</person> like THAT?</litDev></q></p>
		<p>
			<q sp="alice">
				<litDev type="apost">Now, if <person ref="bk">you</person>'ll only attend, <person
						ref="bk">Kitty</person>, and not talk so much, <person ref="alice"
						>I</person>'ll tell <person ref="bk">you</person> all <person ref="alice"
						>my</person> ideas about Looking-glass House. First, there's the room
						<person ref="bk">you</person> can see through the glass--that's just the
					same as <person ref="alice family">our</person> drawing room, only the things go
					the other way. <person ref="alice">I</person> can see all of it when <person
						ref="alice">I</person> get upon a chair--all but the bit behind the
					fireplace. Oh! <person ref="alice">I</person> do so wish <person ref="alice"
						>I</person> could see THAT bit! <person ref="alice">I</person> want so much
					to know whether they've a fire in the winter: <person ref="bk">you</person>
					never CAN tell, <person ref="bk">you</person> know, unless <person
						ref="alice family">our</person> fire smokes, and then smoke comes up in that
					room too--but that may be only pretence, just to make it look as if they had a
					fire. Well then, the books are something like <person ref="alice family"
						>our</person> books, only the words go the wrong way; <person ref="alice"
						>I</person> know that, because <person ref="alice">I</person>'ve held up one
					of <person ref="alice family">our</person> books to the glass, and then they
					hold up one in the other room.</litDev>
			</q>
		</p>
		<p><q sp="alice"><litDev type="apost">How would <person ref="bk">you</person> like to live
					in Looking-glass House, <person ref="bk">Kitty</person>? <person ref="alice"
						>I</person> wonder if they'd give <person ref="bk">you</person> milk in
					there? Perhaps Looking-glass milk isn't good to drink--But oh, <person ref="bk"
						>Kitty</person>! now <person ref="alice bk">we</person> come to the passage.
						<person ref="bk">you</person> can just see a little PEEP of the passage in
					Looking-glass House, if <person ref="bk">you</person> leave the door of <person
						ref="alice family">our</person> drawing-room wide open: and it's very like
						<person ref="alice family">our</person> passage as far as <person ref="bk"
						>you</person> can see, only <person ref="bk">you</person> know it may be
					quite different on beyond. Oh, <person ref="bk">Kitty</person>! how nice it
					would be if <person ref="alice bk">we</person> could only get through into
					Looking- glass House! <person ref="alice">I</person>'m sure it's got, oh! such
					beautiful things in it! Let's pretend there's a way of getting through into it,
					somehow, <person ref="bk">Kitty</person>. Let's pretend the glass has got all
					soft like gauze, so that <person ref="alice bk">we</person> can get through.
					Why, it's turning into a sort of mist now, <person ref="alice">I</person>
					declare! It'll be easy enough to get through--</litDev></q>
			<person ref="alice">She</person> was up on the chimney-piece while <person ref="alice"
				>she</person> said this, though <person ref="alice">she</person> hardly knew how
				<person ref="alice">she</person> had got there. And certainly the glass WAS
			beginning to melt away, just like a bright silvery mist.</p>
		<p>In another moment <person ref="alice">Alice</person> was through the glass, and had
			jumped lightly down into the Looking-glass room. The very first thing <person
				ref="alice">she</person> did was to look whether there was a fire in the fireplace,
			and <person ref="alice">she</person> was quite pleased to find that there was a real
			one, blazing away as brightly as the one <person ref="alice">she</person> had left
			behind. <q sp="alice">So <person ref="alice">I</person> shall be as warm here as <person
					ref="alice">I</person> was in the old room,warmer, in fact, because there'll be
				no one here to scold <person ref="alice">me</person> away from the fire. Oh, what
				fun it'll be, when <person ref="family">they</person> see me through the glass in
				here, and can't get at me!</q></p>
		<p>Then <person ref="alice">she</person> began looking about, and noticed that what could be
			seen from the old room was quite common and uninteresting, but that all the rest was as
			different as possible. For instance, the pictures on the wall next the fire seemed to be
			all alive, and the very clock on the chimney-piece (<litDev type="exposition"><person
					ref="reader">you</person> know <person ref="reader">you</person> can only see
				the back of it in the Looking-glass</litDev>) had got the face of a little old man,
			and grinned at <person ref="alice">her</person>.</p>
		<p><q sp="alice">they don't keep this room so tidy as the other,</q>
			<person ref="alice">Alice</person> thought to <person ref="alice">herself</person>, as
				<person ref="alice">she</person> noticed several of the chessmen down in the hearth
			among the cinders: but in another moment, with a little <q sp="alice">Oh!</q> of
			surprise, <person ref="alice">she</person> was down on <person ref="alice">her</person>
			hands and knees watching <person ref="chessmen">them</person>. The chessmen were walking
			about, two and two!</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="alice">Here are the <person ref="redKing">Red King</person> and the <person
					ref="redQueen">Red Queen</person>,and there are the <person ref="whKing">White
					King</person> and the <person ref="whQueen">White Queen</person> sitting on the
				edge of the shovel--and here are two <person ref="chessmen">castles</person> walking
				arm in arm--<person ref="alice">I</person> don't think <person ref="chessmen"
					>they</person> can hear me,and <person ref="alice">I</person>'m nearly sure
					<person ref="chessmen">they</person> can't see me. <person ref="alice"
					>I</person> feel somehow as if <person ref="alice">I</person> were
				invisible--</q>
		</p>
		<p>Here something began squeaking on the table behind <person ref="alice">Alice</person>,
			and made <person ref="alice">her</person> turn <person ref="alice">her</person> head
			just in time to see <person ref="lily">one of the White Pawns</person> roll over and
			begin kicking: <person ref="alice">she</person> watched <person ref="lily">it</person>
			with great curiosity to see what would happen next.</p>
		<p><q sp="whQueen">It is the voice of <person ref="whQueen">my</person> child!</q>
				the<person ref="whQueen">White Queen</person> cried out as <person ref="whQueen"
				>she</person> rushed past the <person ref="whKing">King</person>, so violently that
				<person ref="whQueen">she</person> knocked <person ref="whKing">him</person> over
			among the cinders. <q sp="whQueen"><person ref="whQueen">my</person> precious <person
					ref="lily">Lily</person>! <person ref="whQueen">my</person> imperial kitten!</q>
			and <person ref="whQueen">she</person> began scrambling wildly up the side of the
			fender.</p>
		<p><q sp="whKing">Imperial fiddlestick!</q> said the <person ref="whKing">King</person>,
			rubbing <person ref="whKing">his</person> nose, which had been hurt by the fall. <person
				ref="whKing">he</person> had a right to be a LITTLE annoyed with <person
				ref="whQueen">the Queen</person>, for <person ref="whKing">he</person> was covered
			with ashes from head to foot.</p>
		<p><person ref="alice">Alice</person> was very anxious to be of use, and, as the poor little
				<person ref="lily">Lily</person> was nearly screaming <person ref="alice"
				>herself</person> into a fit, <person ref="alice">she</person> hastily picked up the
			Queen and set <person ref="whQueen">her</person> on the table by the side of <person
				ref="whQueen">her</person> noisy little daughter.</p>
		<p><person ref="whQueen">The Queen</person> gasped, and sat down: the rapid journey through
			the air had quite taken away <person ref="whQueen">her</person> breath and for a minute
			or two <person ref="whQueen">she</person> could do nothing but hug the little <person
				ref="lily">Lily</person> in silence. As soon as <person ref="whQueen">she</person>
			had recovered <person ref="whQueen">her</person> breath a little, <person ref="whQueen"
				>she</person> called out to the <person ref="whKing">White King</person>, who was
			sitting sulkily among the ashes, <q sp="whQueen">Mind the volcano!</q></p>
		<p><q sp="whKing">What volcano?</q> said the <person ref="whKing">King</person>, looking up
			anxiously into the fire, as if <person ref="whKing">he</person> thought that was the
			most likely place to find one.</p>
		<p><q sp="whQueen">Blew--<person ref="whQueen">me</person>--up,</q> panted the <person
				ref="whQueen">Queen</person>, who was still a little out of breath. <q sp="whQueen"
				>Mind <person ref="whKing">you</person> come up--the regular way--don't get blown
				up!</q></p>
		<p><person ref="alice">Alice</person> watched the <person ref="whKing">White King</person>
			as <person ref="whKing">he</person> slowly struggled up from bar to bar, till at last
				<person ref="alice">she</person> said, <q sp="alice">Why, <person ref="whKing"
					>you</person>'ll be hours and hours getting to the table, at that rate. <person
					ref="alice">I</person>'d far better help <person ref="whKing">you</person>,
				hadn't <person ref="alice">I</person>?</q> But the <person ref="whKing"
				>King</person> took no notice of the question: it was quite clear that <person
				ref="whKing">he</person> could neither hear <person ref="alice">her</person> nor see
				<person ref="alice">her</person>.</p>
		<p>So <person ref="alice">Alice</person> picked <person ref="whKing">him</person> up very
			gently, and lifted <person ref="whKing">him</person> across more slowly than <person
				ref="alice">she</person> had lifted <person ref="whQueen">the Queen</person>, that
				<person ref="alice">she</person> mightn't take <person ref="whKing">his</person>
			breath away: but, before <person ref="alice">she</person> put <person ref="whKing"
				>him</person> on the table, <person ref="alice">she</person> thought <person
				ref="alice">she</person> might as well dust <person ref="whKing">him</person> a
			little, <person ref="whKing">he</person> was so covered with ashes.</p>
		<p><person ref="alice">She</person> said afterwards that <person ref="alice">she</person>
			had never seen in all <person ref="alice">her</person> life such a face as the <person
				ref="whKing">King</person> made, when <person ref="whKing">he</person> found <person
				ref="whKing">himself</person> held in the air by an invisible hand, and being
			dusted: <person ref="whKing">he</person> was far too much astonished to cry out, but
				<person ref="whKing">his</person> eyes and <person ref="whKing">his</person> mouth
			went on getting larger and larger, and rounder and rounder, till <person ref="alice"
				>her</person> hand shook so with laughing that <person ref="alice">she</person>
			nearly let <person ref="whKing">him</person> drop upon the floor.</p>
		<p><q sp="alice">Oh! PLEASE don't make such faces, <person ref="whKing">my</person>
				dear!</q>
			<person ref="alice">she</person> cried out, quite forgetting that the <person
				ref="whKing">King</person> couldn't hear <person ref="alice">her</person>. <q
				sp="alice"><person ref="whKing">you</person> make me laugh so that <person
					ref="alice">I</person> can hardly hold <person ref="whKing">you</person>! And
				don't keep <person ref="whKing">your</person> mouth so wide open! All the ashes will
				get into it--there, now <person ref="alice">I</person> think <person ref="whKing"
					>you</person>'re tidy enough!</q>
			<person ref="alice">she</person> added, as <person ref="alice">she</person> smoothed
				<person ref="whKing">his</person> hair, and set <person ref="whKing">him</person>
			upon the table near the <person ref="whQueen">Queen</person>.</p>
		<p>The <person ref="whKing">King</person> immediately fell flat on <person ref="whKing"
				>his</person> back, and lay perfectly still: and <person ref="alice">Alice</person>
			was a little alarmed at what <person ref="alice">she</person> had done, and went round
			the room to see if <person ref="alice">she</person> could find any water to throw over
				<person ref="alice">him</person>. However, <person ref="alice">she</person> could
			find nothing but a bottle of ink, and when <person ref="alice">she</person> got back
			with it <person ref="alice">she</person> found <person ref="whKing">he</person> had
			recovered, and <person ref="whKing">he</person> and <person ref="whQueen">the
				Queen</person> were talking together in a frightened whisper--so low, that <person
				ref="alice">Alice</person> could hardly hear what <person ref="whQueen whKing"
				>they</person> said.</p>
		<p>The <person ref="whKing">King</person> was saying, <q sp="whKing"><person ref="whKing"
					>I</person> assure, <person ref="whQueen">you</person>
				<person ref="whKing">my</person> dear, <person ref="whKing">I</person> turned cold

		<p>To which <person ref="whQueen">the Queen</person> replied, <q sp="whQueen"><person

		<p>
			<q sp="whKing">The horror of that moment,<person ref="whKing">I</person> shall never,

		</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="whQueen"><person ref="whKing">you</person> will, though,if <person ref="whKing"
					>you</person> don't make a memorandum of it.</q>
		</p>
		<p><person ref="alice">Alice</person> looked on with great interest as <person ref="whKing"
				>the King</person> took an enormous memorandum-book out of <person ref="whKing"
				>his</person> pocket, and began writing. A sudden thought struck <person ref="alice"
				>her</person>, and <person ref="alice">she</person> took hold of the end of the
			pencil, which came some way over <person ref="whKing">his</person> shoulder, and began
			writing for <person ref="whKing">him</person>.</p>
		<p>The poor King looked puzzled and unhappy, and struggled with the pencil for some time
			without saying anything; but <person ref="alice">Alice</person> was too strong for
				<person ref="whKing">him</person>, and at last <person ref="whKing">he</person>
			panted out,<q sp="whKing"><person ref="whKing">my</person>
				<person ref="whQueen">dear</person>! <person ref="whKing">I</person> really MUST get

				writes all manner of things that <person ref="whKing">I</person> don't

		<p>
			<q sp="whQueen">What manner of things?That's not a memorandum of <person ref="whKing"

		</p>
		<p>There was a book lying near <person ref="alice">Alice</person> on the table, and while

			<q sp="alice"><person ref="alice">I</person> should see the garden far better,if <person
					ref="alice">I</person> could get to the top of that hill: and here's a path that
				leads straight to it--at least, no, it doesn't do that--but <person ref="alice"
					>I</person> suppose it will at last. But how curiously it twists! It's more like
				a corkscrew than a path! Well, THIS turn goes to the hill, <person ref="alice"
					>I</person> suppose--no, it doesn't! This goes straight back to the house! Well
				then, <person ref="alice">I</person>'ll try it the other way.</q>
		</p>
		<p>And so <person ref="alice">she</person> did: wandering up and down, and trying turn after
			turn, but always coming back to the house, do what <person ref="alice">she</person>
			would. Indeed, once, when <person ref="alice">she</person> turned a corner rather more
			quickly than usual, <person ref="alice">she</person> ran against it before <person
				ref="alice">she</person> could stop <person ref="alice">herself</person>.</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="alice">
				<litDev type="apost">It's no use talking about it,<litDev/><litDev/><person

			</q>
		</p>
		<p>So, resolutely turning <person ref="alice">her</person> back upon the house, <person
				ref="alice">she</person> set out once more down the path, determined to keep
			straight on till <person ref="alice">she</person> got to the hill. For a few minutes all
			went on well, and <person ref="alice">she</person> was just saying, <q sp="alice"
					><person ref="alice">I</person> really SHALL do it this time--</q> when the path
			gave a sudden twist and shook itself (<litDev type="exposition">as <person ref="alice"

		<p>
			<q sp="alice">Oh, it's too bad!<person ref="alice">I</person> never saw such a house for

		</p>
		<p>However, there was the hill full in sight, so there was nothing to be done but start
			again. This time <person ref="alice">she</person> came upon a large flower-bed, with a
			border of daisies, and a willow-tree growing in the middle.</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="alice">
				<litDev type="apost">O <person ref="tigLil"

		<p>
			<q sp="tigLil">As well as <person ref="alice">you</person> can, And a great deal

		<p><q sp="daisy2">Didn't <person ref="alice">you</person> know THAT?</q> cried another

		</p>
		<p>There was silence in a moment, and several of the pink <person ref="daisies"
				>daisies</person> turned white.</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="tigLil">That's right!The <person ref="daisies">daisies</person> are worst of all.
				When one speaks, <person ref="daisies">they</person> all begin together, and it's

		</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="alice">How is it <person ref="flowers">you</person> can all talk so

		</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="tigLil">Put <person ref="alice">your</person> hand down, and feel the ground,

		<p>
			<q sp="tigLil">In most gardens, <litDev type="pun">they make the beds too soft--so that

		</p>
		<p>This sounded a very good reason, and <person ref="alice">Alice</person> was quite pleased

			<person ref="alice">she</person> said.</p>
		<p><q sp="rose">It's <person ref="rose">my</person> opinion that <person ref="alice"

		<p><q sp="alice">Are there any more people in the garden besides <person ref="alice"

		<p>
			<q sp="rose">Well, <person ref="redQueen">she</person> has the same awkward shape as

			<q sp="rose">But that's not <person ref="alice">your</person> fault,<person ref="alice"

		</p>
		<p><person ref="alice">Alice</person> didn't like this idea at all: so, to change the

		<p>
			<q sp="rose"><person ref="rose">I</person> daresay <person ref="alice">you</person>'ll

		<p><q sp="alice">Where does <person ref="redQueen">she</person> wear the thorns?</q>

		<p>
			<q sp="rose">Why all round <person ref="redQueen">her</person> head, of course,<person

				<person ref="redQueen">she</person> had been only three inches high--and here
				<person ref="redQueen">she</person> was, half a head taller than <person ref="alice"

			<person ref="alice">herself</person>!</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="rose"><litDev type="irony">It's the fresh air that does it</litDev>,wonderfully

		<p>
			<q sp="rose"><person ref="alice">you</person> can't possibly do that,<litDev

		<p>This sounded nonsense to <person ref="alice">Alice</person>, so <person ref="alice"
				>she</person> said nothing, but set off at once towards the <person ref="redQueen"
				>Red Queen</person>. To <person ref="alice">her</person> surprise, <person

		<p>A little provoked, <person ref="alice">she</person> drew back, and after looking

				<person ref="alice">she</person> thought <person ref="alice">she</person> would try

		<p>It succeeded beautifully. <person ref="alice">She</person> had not been walking a minute

		<p><person ref="alice">Alice</person> curtseyed again, as <person ref="alice">she</person>

				<person ref="redQueen alice">they</person> got to the top of the little hill.</p>
		<p>For some minutes <person ref="alice">Alice</person> stood without speaking, looking out
			in all directions over the country--and a most curious country it was. There were a
			number of tiny little brooks running straight across it from side to side, and the
			ground between was divided up into squares by a number of little green hedges, that
			reached from brook to brook.</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="alice"><person ref="alice">I</person> declare it's marked out just like a large
				chessboard!There ought to be some men moving about somewhere --and so there are!It's
				a great huge game of chess that's being played--all over the world--if this IS the

					<person ref="alice">I</person> WISH <person ref="alice">I</person> was one of

		</p>
		<p><person ref="alice">She</person> glanced rather shyly at <person ref="redQueen">the real

				>That's easily managed. <person ref="alice">you</person> can be the<person

					>you</person>'ll be a Queen --</q> Just at this moment, somehow or other,
				<person ref="redQueen alice">they</person> began to run.</p>
		<p><person ref="alice">Alice</person> never could quite make out, in thinking it over
			afterwards, how it was that <person ref="redQueen alice">they</person> began: all
				<person ref="alice">she</person> remembers is, that <person ref="redQueen alice"
				>they</person> were running hand in hand, and the Queen went so fast that it was all
				<person ref="alice">she</person> could do to keep up with <person ref="redQueen"
				>her</person>: and still <person ref="redQueen">the Queen</person> kept crying<q
				sp="redQueen"><imp>Faster!</imp><imp>Faster!</imp></q> but <person ref="alice"
				>Alice</person> felt <person ref="alice">she</person> COULD NOT go faster, though
				<person ref="alice">she</person> had not breath left to say so.</p>
		<p>The most curious part of the thing was, that the trees and the other things round <person
				ref="redQueen alice">them</person> never changed their places at all: however fast
				<person ref="redQueen alice">they</person> went, <person ref="redQueen alice"
				>they</person> never seemed to pass anything. <q sp="alice"><person ref="alice"
					>I</person> wonder if all the things move along with <person

				<person ref="alice">her</person> thoughts, for <person ref="redQueen">she</person>
				cried,<q sp="redQueen"><imp>Faster!</imp>
				<imp>Don't try to talk!</imp></q></p>
		<p>Not that <person ref="alice">Alice</person> had any idea of doing THAT. <person

			<person ref="alice">Alice</person> managed to pant out at last.</p>
		<p><q sp="redQueen">Nearly there!Why, <person ref="redQueen alice">we</person> passed it ten

			ran on for a time in silence, with the wind whistling in <person ref="alice"
				>Alice</person>'s ears, and almost blowing <person ref="alice">her</person> hair off
				<person ref="alice">her</person> head, <person ref="alice">she</person> fancied.</p>
		<p><q sp="redQueen">Now! Now!<imp>Faster!</imp>
				<imp>Faster!</imp></q> And <person ref="redQueen alice">they</person> went so fast
			that at last <person ref="redQueen alice">they</person> seemed to skim through the air,
			hardly touching the ground with their feet, till suddenly, just as <person ref="alice"
				>Alice</person> was getting quite exhausted, <person ref="redQueen alice"
				>they</person> stopped, and <person ref="alice">she</person> found <person
				ref="alice">herself</person> sitting on the ground, breathless and giddy.</p>
		<p><person ref="redQueen">The Queen</person> propped <person ref="alice">her</person> up

		<p><person ref="alice">Alice</person> looked round <person ref="alice">her</person> in great

		</p>
		<p><person ref="alice">Alice</person> thought it would not be civil to say "No," though it

		<p>
			<q sp="redQueen">At the end of two yards,<person ref="redQueen">I</person> shall give

		<p><person ref="alice">Alice</person> did not know what to say to this, but luckily the

		<p><person ref="redQueen">She</person> had got all the pegs put in by this time, and <person

		<p>At the two-yard peg <person ref="redQueen">she</person> faced round, and said,<q

		<p><q sp="alice"><person ref="alice">I</person>--<person ref="alice">I</person> didn't know

		<p><q sp="redQueen"><person ref="alice">you</person> SHOULD have said, "It's extremely kind

			<person ref="alice">Alice</person> got up and curtseyed, and sat down again.</p>
		<p>At the next peg <person ref="redQueen">the Queen</person> turned again, and this time
				<person ref="redQueen">she</person> said,<q sp="redQueen"><imp>Speak in French when

		<p>How it happened, <person ref="alice">Alice</person> never knew, but exactly as <person

		<chapterHead>CHAPTER III - Looking-Glass Insects</chapterHead>
		<p>Of course the first thing to do was to make a grand survey of the country <person
				ref="alice">she</person> was going to travel through.<q sp="alice">It's something
				very like learning geography,Principal rivers-- there ARE none. Principal
					mountains--<person ref="alice">I</person>'m on the only one, but <person
					ref="alice">I</person> don't think it's got any name. Principal towns--why, what
				ARE those creatures, making honey down there? they can't be bees-- nobody ever saw
				bees a mile off, <person ref="hypo">you</person> know--</q> and for some time
				<person ref="alice">she</person> stood silent, watching one of them that was
			bustling about among the flowers, poking its proboscis into them,<q sp="alice">just as
				if it was a regular bee,</q> thought <person ref="alice">Alice</person>.</p>
		<p>However, this was anything but a regular bee: in fact it was an elephant--as <person
				ref="alice">Alice</person> soon found out, though the idea quite took <person
				ref="alice">her</person> breath away at first.<q sp="alice">And what enormous
				flowers they must be!Something like cottages with the roofs taken off, and stalks
				put to them--and what quantities of honey they must make! <person ref="alice"
					>I</person> think <person ref="alice">I</person>'ll go down and--no, <person
					ref="alice">I</person> won't JUST yet,</q>
			<person ref="alice">she</person> went on, checking <person ref="alice">herself</person>
			just as <person ref="alice">she</person> was beginning to run down the hill, and trying
			to find some excuse for turning shy so suddenly.<q sp="alice">It'll never do to go down
				among them without a good long branch to brush them away--and what fun it'll be when
				they ask me how <person ref="alice">I</person> like <person ref="alice">my</person>
				walk. <person ref="alice">I</person> shall say-- "Oh, <person ref="alice">I</person>

		<p>
			<q sp="alice"><person ref="alice">I</person> think <person ref="alice">I</person>'ll go

		</p>
		<p>So with this excuse <person ref="alice">she</person> ran down the hill and jumped over

			<person ref="alice">she</person> said to <person ref="alice">herself</person>. In

			caught at the thing nearest to <person ref="alice">her</person> hand, which happened to

		<p>* * * * * * *</p>
		<p>* * * * * *</p>
		<p>* * * * * * *</p>
		<p>But the beard seemed to melt away as <person ref="alice">she</person> touched it, and
				<person ref="alice">she</person> found <person ref="alice">herself</person> sitting

			<litDev type="exposition">(for that was the insect <person ref="alice">she</person> had

		<p>It certainly was a VERY large <person ref="gnat">Gnat</person>:<q sp="alice">about the

			<person ref="alice">Alice</person> thought. Still, <person ref="alice">she</person>
			couldn't feel nervous with it, after <person ref="alice gnat">they</person> had been

		<p><q sp="gnat">--then <person ref="alice">you</person> don't like all insects?</q> the

		<p>
			<q sp="alice"><person ref="alice">I</person> like them when they can talk,None of them

		</p>
		<p><q sp="gnat">What sort of insects do <person ref="alice">you</person> rejoice in, where
					<person ref="alice">you</person> come from?</q> the <person ref="gnat"
				>Gnat</person> inquired.</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="alice"><person ref="alice">I</person> don't REJOICE in insects at all,because
					<person ref="alice">I</person>'m rather afraid of them--at least the large
				kinds. But <person ref="alice">I</person> can tell <person ref="alice">you</person>
				the names of some of them.</q>
		</p>
		<p><q sp="gnat">Of course they answer to their names?</q> the <person ref="gnat"
				>Gnat</person> remarked carelessly.</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="alice"><person ref="alice">I</person> never knew them do it.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="gnat">What's the use of their having names,if they won't answer to them?</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="alice">No use to them,but it's useful to the people who name them, <person
					ref="alice">I</person> suppose. If not, why do things have names at all?</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="gnat"><person ref="gnat">I</person> can't say,Further on, in the wood down there,
				they've got no names--however, go on with <person ref="alice">your</person> list of
				insects: <person ref="alice">you</person>'re wasting time.</q>
		</p>
		<p><q sp="alice">Well, there's the Horse-fly,</q>
			<person ref="alice">Alice</person> began, counting off the names on <person ref="alice"
				>her</person> fingers.</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="gnat">All right,half way up that bush, <person ref="alice">you</person>'ll see
					<litDev type="pun">a Rocking-horse-fly</litDev>, if <person ref="alice"
					>you</person> look. It's made entirely of wood, and gets about by swinging
				itself from branch to branch.</q>
		</p>
		<p><q sp="alice">What does it live on?</q>
			<person ref="alice">Alice</person> asked, with great curiosity.</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="gnat">Sap and sawdust,<imp>Go on with the list.</imp></q>
		</p>
		<p><person ref="alice">Alice</person> looked up at the Rocking-horse-fly with great
			interest, and made up <person ref="alice">her</person> mind that it must have been just
			repainted, it looked so bright and sticky; and then <person ref="alice">she</person>
			went on.</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="alice">And there's the Dragon-fly.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="gnat">Look on the branch above <person ref="alice">your</person> head,and there
					<person ref="alice">you</person>'ll find a <litDev type="pun"
					>snap-dragon-fly</litDev>. Its body is made of plum-pudding, its wings of
				holly-leaves, and its head is a raisin burning in brandy.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="alice">And what does it live on?</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="gnat">Frumenty and mince pie,and it makes its nest in a Christmas box.</q>
		</p>
		<p><q sp="alice">And then there's the Butterfly,</q>
			<person ref="alice">Alice</person> went on, after <person ref="alice">she</person> had
			taken a good look at the insect with its head on fire, and had thought to <person
				ref="alice">herself</person>, <q sp="alice"><person ref="alice">I</person> wonder if
				that's the reason insects are so fond of flying into candles--because they want to
				turn into Snap-dragon-flies!</q></p>
		<p>
			<q sp="gnat">Crawling at <person ref="alice">your</person> feet,<person ref="alice"
					>you</person> may observe a <litDev type="pun">Bread-and-Butterfly</litDev>. Its
				wings are thin slices of Bread-and-butter, its body is a crust, and its head is a
				lump of sugar.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="alice">And what does IT live on?</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="gnat">Weak tea with cream in it.</q>
		</p>
		<p>A new difficulty came into <person ref="alice">Alice</person>'s head.<q sp="alice"
				>Supposing it couldn't find any?</q>
			<person ref="alice">she</person> suggested.</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="gnat">Then it would die, of course.</q>
		</p>
		<p><q sp="alice">But that must happen very often,</q>
			<person ref="alice">Alice</person> remarked thoughtfully.</p>
		<p><q sp="gnat">It always happens,</q> said the <person ref="gnat">Gnat</person>.</p>
		<p>After this, <person ref="alice">Alice</person> was silent for a minute or two, pondering.
			The <person ref="gnat">Gnat</person> amused itself meanwhile by humming round and round
				<person ref="alice">her</person> head: at last it settled again and remarked, <q
				sp="gnat"><person ref="gnat">I</person> suppose <person ref="alice">you</person>
				don't want to lose <person ref="alice">your</person> name?</q></p>
		<p><q sp="alice">No, indeed,</q>
			<person ref="alice">Alice</person> said, a little anxiously.</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="gnat">And yet <person ref="gnat">I</person> don't know,only think how convenient
				it would be if <person ref="alice">you</person> could manage to go home without it!
				For instance, if <person ref="nurse">the governess</person> wanted to call <person
					ref="alice">you</person> to <person ref="alice">your</person> lessons, <person
					ref="nurse">she</person> would call out "come here--," and there <person
					ref="nurse">she</person> would have to leave off, because there wouldn't be any
				name for <person ref="nurse">her</person> to call, and of course <person ref="alice"
					>you</person> wouldn't have to go, <person ref="alice">you</person> know.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="alice">That would never do, <person ref="alice">I</person>'m sure,<person
					ref="nurse">the governess</person> would never think of excusing <person
					ref="alice">me</person> lessons for that. If <person ref="nurse">she</person>
				couldn't remember <person ref="alice">my</person> name, <person ref="nurse"
					>she'd</person> call <person ref="alice">me</person> "Miss!" as the servants
				do.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="gnat">Well, if <person ref="nurse">she</person> said "Miss," and didn't say
				anything more,of course <person ref="alice">you</person>'d miss <person ref="alice"
					>your</person> lessons. That's a joke. <person ref="alice">I</person> wish
					<person ref="alice">you</person> had made it.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="alice">Why do <person ref="gnat">you</person> wish _<person ref="alice"
					>I</person>_ had made it?It's a very bad one.</q>
		</p>
		<p>But the <person ref="gnat">Gnat</person> only sighed deeply, while two large tears came
			rolling down <person ref="gnat">its</person> cheeks.</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="alice"><person ref="alice">you</person> shouldn't make jokes,if it makes <person
					ref="gnat">you</person> so unhappy.</q>
		</p>
		<p>Then came another of those melancholy little sighs, and this time the poor <person
				ref="gnat">Gnat</person> really seemed to have sighed <person ref="gnat"
				>itself</person> away, for, when <person ref="alice">Alice</person> looked up, there
			was nothing whatever to be seen on the twig, and, as <person ref="alice">she</person>
			was getting quite chilly with sitting still so long, <person ref="alice">she</person>
			got up and walked on.</p>
		<p><person ref="alice">She</person> very soon came to an open field, with a wood on the
			other side of it: it looked much darker than the last wood, and <person ref="alice"
				>Alice</person> felt a LITTLE timid about going into it. However, on second
			thoughts, <person ref="alice">she</person> made up <person ref="alice">her</person> mind
			to go on:<q sp="alice">for <person ref="alice">I</person> certainly won't go BACK,</q>
			<person ref="alice">she</person> thought to <person ref="alice">herself</person>, and
			this was the only way to the Eighth Square.</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="alice">This must be the wood,where things have no names. <person ref="alice"
					>I</person> wonder what'll become of <person ref="alice">my</person> name when
					<person ref="alice">I</person> go in? <person ref="alice">I</person> shouldn't
				like to lose it at all--because <person ref="hypo">they</person>'d have to give me
				another, and it would be almost certain to be an ugly one. But then the fun would be
				trying to find the creature that had got <person ref="alice">my</person> old name!
				That's just like the advertisements, <person ref="hypo">you</person> know, when
				people lose dogs--"ANSWERS TO THE NAME OF DASH: HAD ON A BRASS COLLAR"--just fancy
				calling everything <person ref="alice">you</person> met till one of them answered!
				Only they wouldn't answer at all, if they were wise.</q>
		</p>
		<p><person ref="alice">She</person> was rambling on in this way when <person ref="alice"
				>she</person> reached the wood: it looked very cool and shady.<q sp="alice">Well, at
				any rate it's a great comfort,after being so hot, to get into the--into WHAT?<person
					ref="alice">I</person> mean to get under the--under the--under THIS, you
				know!What DOES it call itself, <person ref="alice">I</person> wonder? <person
					ref="alice">I</person> do believe it's got no name--why, to be sure it
				hasn't!</q></p>
		<p><person ref="alice">She</person> stood silent for a minute, thinking: then <person
				ref="alice">she</person> suddenly began again.<q sp="alice">Then it really HAS
				happened, after all! And now, who am <person ref="alice">I</person>? <person
					ref="alice">I</person> WILL remember, if <person ref="alice">I</person> can!
					<person ref="alice">I</person>'m determined to do it!</q> But being determined
			didn't help much, and all <person ref="alice">she</person> could say, after a great deal
			of puzzling, was,<q sp="alice">L, <person ref="alice">I</person> KNOW it begins with
				L!</q></p>
		<p>Just then <person ref="fawn">a Fawn</person> came wandering by: it looked at <person
				ref="alice">Alice</person> with its large gentle eyes, but didn't seem at all
				frightened.<q sp="alice">Here then! Here then!</q>
			<person ref="alice">Alice</person> said, as <person ref="alice">she</person> held out
				<person ref="alice">her</person> hand and tried to stroke it; but it only started
			back a little, and then stood looking at <person ref="alice">her</person> again.</p>
		<p><q sp="fawn">What do <person ref="alice">you</person> call <person ref="alice"
					>yourself</person>?</q> the Fawn said at last. Such a soft sweet voice it
			had!</p>
		<p><q sp="alice"><person ref="alice">I</person> wish <person ref="alice">I</person>
				knew!</q> thought poor <person ref="alice">Alice</person>. <person ref="alice"
				>She</person> answered, rather sadly,<q sp="alice">Nothing, just now.</q></p>
		<p>
			<q sp="fawn">Think again,that won't do.</q>
		</p>
		<p><person ref="alice">Alice</person> thought, but nothing came of it.<q sp="alice">Please,
				would <person ref="fawn">you</person> tell me what <person ref="fawn">you</person>
				call <person ref="fawn">yourself</person>?<person ref="alice">I</person> think that
				might help a little.</q></p>
		<p>
			<q sp="fawn"><person ref="fawn">I</person>'ll tell <person ref="alice">you</person>, if
					<person ref="alice">you</person>'ll move a little further on,<person ref="fawn"
					>I</person> can't remember here.</q>
		</p>
		<p>So <person ref="alice fawn">they</person> walked on together though the wood, <person
				ref="alice">Alice</person> with <person ref="alice">her</person> arms clasped
			lovingly round the soft neck of <person ref="fawn">the Fawn,</person> till <person
				ref="alice fawn">they</person> came out into another open field, and here <person
				ref="fawn">the Fawn</person> gave a sudden bound into the air, and shook <person
				ref="fawn">itself</person> free from <person ref="alice">Alice</person>'s arms. <q
				sp="fawn"><person ref="fawn">I</person>'m a Fawn!and, dear me! <person ref="alice"
					>you</person>'re a human child!</q> A sudden look of alarm came into <person
				ref="fawn">its</person> beautiful brown eyes, and in another moment <person
				ref="alice">it</person> had darted away at full speed.</p>
		<p><person ref="alice">Alice</person> stood looking after it, almost ready to cry with
			vexation at having lost <person ref="alice">her</person> dear little fellow-traveller so
				suddenly.<q sp="alice">However, <person ref="alice">I</person> know <person
					ref="alice">my</person> name now.that's SOME comfort. <person ref="alice"
					>Alice</person>--<person ref="alice">Alice</person>--<person ref="alice"
					>I</person> won't forget it again. And now, which of these finger-posts ought
					<person ref="alice">I</person> to follow, <person ref="alice">I</person>
				wonder?</q></p>
		<p>It was not a very difficult question to answer, as there was only one road through the
			wood, and the two finger-posts both pointed along it. <q sp="alice"><person ref="alice"
					>I</person>'ll settle it,when the road divides and they point different
				ways.</q></p>
		<p>But this did not seem likely to happen. <person ref="alice">She</person> went on and on,
			a long way, but wherever the road divided there were sure to be two finger-posts
			pointing the same way, one marked "TO TWEEDLEDUM'S HOUSE" and the other "TO THE HOUSE OF
			TWEEDLEDEE."</p>
		<p><q sp="alice"><person ref="alice">I</person> do believe,that <person ref="dee dum"
					>they</person> live in the same house! <person ref="alice">I</person> wonder
					<person ref="alice">I</person> never thought of that before--But <person
					ref="alice">I</person> can't stay there long. <person ref="alice">I</person>'ll
				just call and say "how d'you do?" and ask <person ref="dee dum">them</person> the
				way out of the wood. If <person ref="alice">I</person> could only get to the Eighth
				Square before it gets dark!</q> So <person ref="alice">she</person> wandered on,
			talking to <person ref="alice">herself</person> as <person ref="alice">she</person>
			went, till, on turning a sharp corner, <person ref="alice">she</person> came upon two
				<person ref="dee dum">fat little men</person>, so suddenly that <person ref="alice"
				>she</person> could not help starting back, but in another moment <person
				ref="alice">she</person> recovered <person ref="alice">herself</person>, feeling
			sure that <person ref="dee dum">they</person> must be.</p>

			lay, opening and shutting <person ref="dee">his</person> mouth and <person ref="dee"

		<p><person ref="alice">She</person> caught the shawl as <person ref="alice">she</person>
			spoke, and looked about for the owner: in another moment the <person ref="whQueen">White
				Queen</person> came running wildly through the wood, with both arms stretched out
			wide, as if <person ref="whQueen">she</person> were flying, and <person ref="alice"
				>Alice</person> very civilly went to meet <person ref="whQueen">her</person> with
			the shawl.</p>
		<p><q sp="alice"><person ref="alice">I</person>'m very glad <person ref="alice">I</person>

			<person ref="alice">Alice</person> said, as <person ref="alice">she</person> helped

			again.</p>
		<p>The<person ref="whQueen">White Queen</person> only looked at <person ref="alice"
				>her</person> in a helpless frightened sort of way, and kept repeating something in
			a whisper to <person ref="whQueen">herself</person> that sounded like "bread-and-butter,
			bread-and-butter," and <person ref="alice">Alice</person> felt that if there was to be
			any conversation at all, <person ref="whQueen">she</person> must manage it <person
				ref="alice">herself</person>. So <person ref="alice">she</person> began rather
				timidly:<q sp="alice">Am <person ref="alice">I</person> addressing the<person

		<p>
			<q sp="whQueen"><litDev type="pun">Well, yes, if <person ref="alice">you</person> call

		</p>
		<p><person ref="alice">Alice</person> thought it would never do to have an argument at the

				said,<q sp="alice">If <person ref="whQueen">your Majesty</person> will only tell

		<p><person ref="whQueen">her</person> screams were so exactly <litDev type="simile">like the

		<p>

		<p><q sp="whQueen">When <person ref="whQueen">I</person> fasten <person ref="whQueen"

		<p>
			<q sp="whQueen">That accounts for the bleeding, <person ref="alice">you</person> see,Now

		</p>
		<p>The brooch had come undone as <person ref="whQueen">she</person> spoke, and a sudden gust

				<person ref="whQueen">The Queen</person> spread out <person ref="whQueen"

		<p>* * * * * * *</p>

		<p><q sp="whQueen">Oh, much better!Much be-etter! Be-etter! Be-e-e-etter! Be-e-ehh!</q> The
			last word ended in a long bleat, so like a sheep that <person ref="alice">Alice</person>
			quite started.</p>
		<p><person ref="whQueen">She</person> looked at <person ref="whQueen">the Queen</person>,
			who seemed to have suddenly wrapped <person ref="whQueen">herself</person> up in wool.
				<person ref="alice">Alice</person> rubbed <person ref="alice">her</person> eyes, and
			looked again. <person ref="alice">She</person> couldn't make out what had happened at
			all. Was <person ref="alice">she</person> in a shop? And was that really--was it really
			a <person ref="sheep">sheep</person> that was sitting on the other side of the counter?
			Rub as <person ref="alice">she</person> could, <person ref="alice">she</person> could
			make nothing more of it: <person ref="alice">she</person> was in a little dark shop,
			leaning with <person ref="alice">her</person> elbows on the counter, and opposite to
				<person ref="alice">her</person> was an old <person ref="sheep">sheep</person>,
			sitting in an arm-chair knitting, and every now and then leaving off to look at <person
				ref="alice">her</person> through a great pair of spectacles.</p>
		<p><q sp="sheep">What is it <person ref="alice">you</person> want to buy?</q> the <person
				ref="sheep">sheep</person> said at last, looking up for a moment from <person
				ref="sheep">her</person> knitting.</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="alice"><person ref="alice">I</person> don't QUITE know yet,<person ref="alice"
					>I</person> should like to look all round <person ref="alice">me</person> first,
				if <person ref="alice">I</person> might.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="sheep"><person ref="alice">you</person> may look in front of <person ref="alice"
					>you</person>, and on both sides, if <person ref="alice">you</person> like,but
					<person ref="alice">you</person> can't look ALL round <person ref="alice"
					>you</person>--unless <person ref="alice">you</person>'ve got eyes at the back
				of <person ref="alice">your</person> head.</q>
		</p>
		<p>But these, as it happened, <person ref="alice">Alice</person> had NOT got: so <person
				ref="alice">she</person> contented <person ref="alice">herself</person> with turning
			round, looking at the shelves as <person ref="alice">she</person> came to them.</p>
		<p>The shop seemed to be full of all manner of curious things-- but the oddest part of it
			all was, that whenever <person ref="alice">she</person> looked hard at any shelf, to
			make out exactly what it had on it, that particular shelf was always quite empty: though
			the others round it were crowded as full as they could hold.</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="alice">Things flow about so here!And this one is the most provoking of all--but
					<person ref="alice">I</person>'ll tell <person ref="hypo">you</person>
					what--<person ref="alice">I</person>'ll follow it up to the very top shelf of
				all. It'll puzzle it to go through the ceiling, <person ref="alice">I</person>
				expect!</q>
		</p>
		<p>But even this plan failed: the "thing" went through the ceiling as quietly as possible,
			as if it were quite used to it.</p>
		<p><q sp="sheep">Are <person ref="alice">you</person> a child or a teetotum?<person
					ref="alice">you</person>'ll make <person ref="sheep">me</person> giddy soon, if
					<person ref="alice">you</person> go on turning round like that.</q>
			<person ref="sheep">She</person> was now working with fourteen pairs at once, and
				<person ref="alice">Alice</person> couldn't help looking at <person ref="sheep"
				>her</person> in great astonishment.</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="alice">How CAN <person ref="sheep">she</person> knit with so many?<person
					ref="sheep">She</person> gets more and more like a porcupine every minute!</q>
		</p>
		<p><q sp="sheep">Can <person ref="alice">you</person> row?</q> the <person ref="sheep"
				>sheep</person> asked, handing <person ref="alice">her</person> a pair of knitting-
			needles as <person ref="sheep">she</person> spoke.</p>
		<p><q sp="alice">Yes, a little--but not on land--and not with needles--</q>
			<person ref="alice">Alice</person> was beginning to say, when suddenly the needles
			turned into oars in <person ref="alice">her</person> hands, and <person ref="alice"
				>she</person> found <person ref="alice sheep">they</person> were in a little boat,
			gliding along between banks: so there was nothing for it but to do <person ref="alice"
				>her</person> best.</p>
		<p><q sp="sheep"><imp>Feather!</imp>!</q> cried the <person ref="sheep">sheep</person>, as
				<person ref="sheep">she</person> took up another pair of needles.</p>
		<p>This didn't sound like a remark that needed any answer, so <person ref="alice"
				>Alice</person> said nothing, but pulled away. There was something very queer about
			the water, <person ref="alice">she</person> thought, as every now and then the oars got
			fast in it, and would hardly come out again.</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="sheep"><imp>Feather!</imp>! <imp>Feather!</imp>!<person ref="alice"
				>you</person>'ll be catching a crab directly.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="alice">A dear little crab!<person ref="alice">I</person> should like that.</q>
		</p>
		<p><q sp="sheep">Didn't <person ref="alice">you</person> hear me say
				"<imp>Feather!</imp>"?</q> the <person ref="sheep">sheep</person> cried angrily,
			taking up quite a bunch of needles.</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="alice">Indeed <person ref="alice">I</person> did,<person ref="sheep"
				>you</person>'ve said it very often--and very loud. Please, where ARE the crabs?</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="sheep">In the water, of course!<imp>Feather!</imp>, <person ref="sheep"
					>I</person> say!</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="alice">WHY do <person ref="sheep">you</person> say "feather" so often?<person
					ref="alice">I</person>'m not a bird!</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="sheep"><person ref="alice">you</person> are,<person ref="sheep">you</person>'re a
				little goose.</q>
		</p>
		<p>This offended <person ref="alice">Alice</person> a little, so there was no more
			conversation for a minute or two, while the boat glided gently on, sometimes among beds
			of weeds (<litDev type="exposition">which made the oars stick fast in the water, worse
				then ever</litDev>), and sometimes under trees, but always with the same tall
			river-banks frowning over <person ref="alice sheep">their</person> heads.</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="alice">Oh, please! There are some scented rushes!There really are--and SUCH
				beauties!</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="sheep"><person ref="alice">you</person> needn't say "please" to ME
					about'em,<person ref="sheep">I</person> didn't put 'em there, and <person
					ref="sheep">I</person>'m not going to take'em away.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="alice">No, but <person ref="alice">I</person> meant--please, may <person
					ref="alice sheep">we</person> wait and pick some?If <person ref="sheep"
					>you</person> don't mind stopping the boat for a minute.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="sheep">How am <person ref="alice">_I_</person> to stop it?If <person ref="alice"
					>you</person> leave off rowing, it'll stop of itself.</q>
		</p>
		<p>So the boat was left to drift down the stream as it would, till it glided gently in among
			the waving rushes. And then the little sleeves were carefully rolled up, and the little
			arms were plunged in elbow-deep to get the rushes a good long way down before breaking
			them off--and for a while <person ref="alice">Alice</person> forgot all about the
				<person ref="sheep">sheep</person> and the knitting, as <person ref="alice"
				>she</person> bent over the side of the boat, with just the ends of <person
				ref="alice">her</person> tangled hair dipping into the water--while with bright
			eager eyes <person ref="alice">she</person> caught at one bunch after another of the
			darling scented rushes.</p>
		<p><q sp="alice"><person ref="alice">I</person> only hope the boat won't tipple over!Oh,
				WHAT a lovely one! Only <person ref="alice">I</person> couldn't quite reach it.</q>
			And it certainly DID seem a little provoking (<litDev type="exposition"><q sp="alice"
					>almost as if it happened on purpose,</q>
				<person ref="alice">she</person> thought</litDev>) that, though <person ref="alice"

		<p><q sp="alice">The prettiest are always further!</q>
			<person ref="alice">she</person> said at last, with a sigh at the obstinacy of the

				<person ref="alice">she</person> scrambled back into <person ref="alice"
				>her</person> place, and began to arrange <person ref="alice">her</person> new-found
			treasures.</p>
		<p>What mattered it to <person ref="alice">her</person> just then that the rushes had begun
			to fade, and to lose all their scent and beauty, from the very moment that <person
				ref="alice">she</person> picked them? <litDev type="exposition">Even real scented
				rushes, <person ref="reader">you</person> know, last only a very little
				while--</litDev>and these, being dream-rushes, melted away almost like snow, as they
			lay in heaps at <person ref="alice">her</person> feet-- but <person ref="alice"
				>Alice</person> hardly noticed this, there were so many other curious things to
			think about.</p>
		<p><person ref="alice sheep">they</person> hadn't gone much farther before the blade of one
			of the oars got fast in the water and WOULDN'T come out again (<litDev type="exposition"
				>so <person ref="alice">Alice</person> explained it afterwards</litDev>), and the
			consequence was that the handle of it caught <person ref="alice">her</person> under the
			chin, and, in spite of a series of little shrieks of <q sp="alice">Oh, oh, oh!</q> from
			poor <person ref="alice">Alice</person>, it swept <person ref="alice">her</person>
			straight off the seat, and down among the heap of rushes.</p>
		<p>However, <person ref="alice">she</person> wasn't hurt, and was soon up again: the <person
				ref="sheep">sheep</person> went on with <person ref="sheep">her</person> knitting
			all the while, just as if nothing had happened.<q sp="sheep">That was a nice crab
					<person ref="alice">you</person> caught!</q>
			<person ref="sheep">she</person> remarked, as <person ref="alice">Alice</person> got
			back into <person ref="alice">her</person> place, very much relieved to find <person
				ref="alice">herself</person> still in the boat.</p>
		<p><q sp="alice">Was it? <person ref="alice">I</person> didn't see it,<person ref="alice"
					>I</person> wish it hadn't let go--<person ref="alice">I</person> should so like

				<person ref="sheep">sheep</person> only laughed scornfully, and went on with <person
				ref="sheep">her</person> knitting.</p>
		<p><q sp="alice">Are there many crabs here?</q> said <person ref="alice">Alice</person>.</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="sheep">Crabs, and all sorts of things,plenty of choice, only make up <person

				want to buy?</q>
		</p>
		<p><q sp="alice">To buy!</q>
			<person ref="alice">Alice</person> echoed in a tone that was half astonished and half
			frightened--for the oars, and the boat, and the river, had vanished all in a moment, and
				<person ref="alice">she</person> was back again in the little dark shop.</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="alice"><person ref="alice">I</person> should like to buy an egg, please,How do
					<person ref="sheep">you</person> sell them?</q>
		</p>
		<p><q sp="sheep">Fivepence farthing for one--Twopence for two,</q> the <person ref="sheep"
				>sheep</person> replied.</p>
		<p><q sp="alice">Then two are cheaper than one?</q>
			<person ref="alice">Alice</person> said in a surprised tone, taking out <person
				ref="alice">her</person> purse.</p>
		<p><q sp="sheep">Only <person ref="alice">you</person> MUST eat them both, if <person
					ref="alice">you</person> buy two,</q> said the <person ref="sheep"
				>sheep</person>.</p>
		<p><q sp="alice">Then <person ref="alice">I</person>'ll have ONE, please,</q> said <person
				ref="alice">Alice</person>, as <person ref="alice">she</person> put the money down

				>herself</person>,<q sp="alice">they mightn't be at all nice, <person ref="hypo"
					>you</person> know.</q></p>
		<p>The <person ref="sheep">sheep</person> took the money, and put it away in a box: then
				<person ref="sheep">she</person> said <q sp="sheep"><litDev type="irony"><person
						ref="sheep">I</person> never put things into people's hands--that would

				>she</person> went off to the other end of the shop, and set the egg upright on a

		<p>
			<q sp="alice"><person ref="alice">I</person> wonder WHY it wouldn't do?The egg seems to

		</p>
		<p>* * * * * * *</p>
		<p>* * * * * *</p>

		<p>So <person ref="alice">she</person> went on, wondering more and more at every step, as

			and <person ref="alice">she</person> quite expected the egg to do the same.</p>

		<q sp="alice"><verse>
				<stanza>

							>slithy</nonSp>
						<nonSp pos="noun">toves</nonSp></line>
					<line>Did<nonSp pos="verb"> gyre</nonSp> and <nonSp pos="verb">gimble</nonSp> in

				</stanza>
			</verse></q>
		<p><q sp="humDum">That's enough to begin with,there are plenty of hard words there. "<nonSp
					pos="noun">BRILLIG</nonSp>" means four o'clock in the afternoon--the time when
					<person ref="hypo">you</person> begin BROILING things for dinner.</q></p>
		<p><q sp="alice">That'll do very well,and <nonSp pos="adj">"SLITHY"</nonSp>?</q></p>
		<p><q sp="humDum">Well, <nonSp pos="adj">'SLITHY'</nonSp> means "<nonSp pos="adj"
					>lithe</nonSp> and slimy." "<nonSp pos="adj">Lithe</nonSp>" is the same as
				active. <person ref="alice">you</person> see it's like a portmanteau--there are two

		<p><q sp="alice"><person ref="alice">I</person> see it now,and what are <nonSp pos="noun"
					>'TOVES'</nonSp>?</q></p>
		<p><q sp="humDum">Well, <nonSp pos="noun">'TOVES'</nonSp> are something like
				badgers--they're something like lizards--and they're something like
			corkscrews.</q></p>
		<p><q sp="alice">they must be very curious looking creatures.</q></p>
		<p><q sp="humDum">they are that,also they make their nests under sun-dials--also they live

		<p><q sp="alice">And what's the <nonSp pos="verb">"GYRE"</nonSp> and to <nonSp pos="verb"
					>"GIMBLE"</nonSp>?</q></p>
		<p><q sp="humDum">To <nonSp pos="verb">"GYRE"</nonSp> is to go round and round like a
				gyroscope. To <nonSp pos="verb">"GIMBLE"</nonSp> is to make holes like a

		<p><q sp="alice">And <nonSp pos="noun">"THE WABE"</nonSp> is the grass-plot round a

		<p><q sp="humDum">Of course it is. It's called <nonSp pos="noun">"WABE,"</nonSp>
				<person ref="alice">you</person> know, because it goes a long way before it, and a

		<p><q sp="alice">And a long way beyond it on each side,</q>
			<person ref="alice">Alice</person> added.</p>
		<p><q sp="humDum">Exactly so. Well, then, <nonSp pos="adj">"MIMSY"</nonSp> is "flimsy and
				miserable" (<litDev type="exposition">there's another portmanteau for <person

					>"BOROGOVE"</nonSp> is a thin shabby-looking bird with its feathers sticking out

		<p><q sp="alice">And then "<nonSp pos="adj">MOME</nonSp>
				<nonSp pos="noun">RATHS</nonSp>"?<person ref="alice">I</person>'m afraid <person
					ref="alice">I</person>'m giving <person ref="humDum">you</person> a great deal
				of trouble.</q></p>
		<p><q sp="humDum">Well, a <nonSp pos="noun">"RATH"</nonSp> is a sort of green pig: but
					<nonSp pos="adj">"MOME"</nonSp>
				<person ref="humDum">I</person>'m not certain about. <person ref="humDum">I</person>
				think it's short for "from home"--meaning that they'd lost their way, <person

		<p><q sp="alice">And what does <nonSp pos="verb">"OUTGRABE"</nonSp> mean?</q></p>
		<p><q sp="humDum">Well, <nonSp pos="verb">"OUTGRABING"</nonSp> is something between

		<p>After a while the noise seemed gradually to die away, till all was dead silence, and

				<person ref="lion">Lion</person> and the <person ref="unicorn">Unicorn</person> and

		<p>At this moment <person ref="alice">her</person> thoughts were interrupted by a loud

			<person ref="whKnight">the Knight</person>cried, as <person ref="redKnight">he</person>

		<p>This time it was a <person ref="whKnight">White Knight</person>. <person ref="whKnight"

		<p>
			<q sp="alice"><person ref="alice">I</person> wonder, now, what the Rules of Battle

		<p><q sp="alice">But what are they for?</q>

		<p>
			<q sp="whKnight"><litDev type="irony">To guard against the bites of sharks,</litDev>It's

		</p>
		<p>This took a very long time to manage, though <person ref="alice">Alice</person> held the

		<p><q sp="whKnight"><person ref="whKnight">I</person> hope <person ref="alice"

		<p><q sp="alice">Only in the usual way,</q>

		<p>
			<q sp="whKnight">That's hardly enough,<person ref="alice">you</person> see the wind is
				so VERY strong here. <litDev type="simile">It's as strong as soup</litDev>.</q>
		</p>
		<p><q sp="alice">Have <person ref="whKnight">you</person> invented a plan for keeping the

			<person ref="alice">Alice</person> enquired.</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="whKnight">Not yet,But <person ref="whKnight">I</person>'ve got a plan for keeping

		</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="alice"><person ref="alice">I</person> should like to hear it, very much.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="whKnight">First <person ref="alice">you</person> take an upright stick,Then
					<person ref="alice">you</person> make <person ref="alice">your</person> hair
				creep up it, <litDev type="simile">like a fruit-tree</litDev>. <litDev type="pun"
					>Now the reason hair falls off is because it hangs DOWN</litDev>--things never

				try it if <person ref="alice">you</person> like.</q>
		</p>
		<p>It didn't sound a comfortable plan, <person ref="alice">Alice</person> thought, and for a
			few minutes <person ref="alice">she</person> walked on in silence, puzzling over the

				Knight</person>, who certainly was NOT a good rider.</p>
		<p>Whenever the horse stopped (<litDev type="exposition">which it did very often</litDev>),
				<person ref="whKnight">he</person> fell off in front; and whenever it went on again
				(<litDev type="exposition">which it generally did rather suddenly</litDev>), <person
				ref="whKnight">he</person> fell off behind. Otherwise <person ref="whKnight"
				>he</person> kept on pretty well, except that <person ref="whKnight">he</person> had

			generally did this on the side on which <person ref="alice">Alice</person> was walking,
				<person ref="alice">she</person> soon found that it was the best plan not to walk

		<p><q sp="alice"><person ref="alice">I</person>'m afraid <person ref="whKnight"

		<p><person ref="whKnight">The Knight</person> looked very much surprised, and a little

			<person ref="alice">he</person> asked, as <person ref="whKnight">he</person> scrambled
			back into the saddle, keeping hold of <person ref="alice">Alice</person>'s hair with one
			hand, to save himself from falling over on the other side.</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="alice">Because people don't fall off quite so often, when <person ref="hypo"

		</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="whKnight"><litDev type="irony"><person ref="whKnight">I</person>'ve had plenty of

		</p>
		<p><person ref="alice">Alice</person> could think of nothing better to say than <q

			went on a little way in silence after this, <person ref="whKnight">the Knight</person>
			with <person ref="whKnight">his</person> eyes shut, muttering to himself, and <person

		<p><q sp="whKnight">The great art of riding,is to keep--</q> Here the sentence ended as

				>Alice</person> was walking. <person ref="alice">She</person> was quite frightened
			this time, and said in an anxious tone, as <person ref="alice">she</person> picked

		<p>
			<q sp="whKnight">None to speak of,The great art of riding, as <person ref="whKnight"

		</p>
		<p><person ref="whKnight">he</person> let go the bridle, and stretched out both <person

				<person ref="whKnight">he</person> meant, and this time <person ref="whKnight"
				>he</person> fell flat on <person ref="whKnight">his</person> back, right under the

		<p><q sp="whKnight">Plenty of practice!</q>
			<person ref="whKnight">he</person> went on repeating, all the time that <person

		</p>
		<p><q sp="whKnight"><litDev type="irony">Does that kind go smoothly?</litDev></q>
			<person ref="whKnight">the Knight</person>asked in a tone of great interest, clasping

		<p><q sp="alice"><litDev type="irony">Much more smoothly than a live horse</litDev>,</q>

			<q sp="whKnight"><litDev type="irony"><person ref="whKnight">I</person>'ll get

		<p><person ref="whKnight">he</person> looked so vexed at the idea, that <person ref="alice"

		<p><person ref="whKnight">The Knight</person> looked down proudly at <person ref="whKnight"

						<person ref="whKnight2">He</person> thought it was <person ref="whKnight2"

		<p>
			<q sp="whKnight"><person ref="whKnight">I</person> had to kick <person ref="whKnight2"

			faces--others upset the decanters, and drank the wine as it ran off the edges of the
			table--and three of <person ref="alles">them</person>
			<litDev type="exposition">(who looked like kangaroos)</litDev> scrambled into the dish
			of roast mutton, and began eagerly lapping up the gravy,<q sp="alice"><litDev
					type="simile">Just like pigs in a trough</litDev>!</q> thought <person
				ref="alice">Alice</person>.</p>
		<p><q sp="redQueen"><person ref="alice">You</person> ought to return thanks in a neat
				speech,</q> the <person ref="redQueen">Red Queen</person> said, frowning at <person

		<p><q sp="whQueen"><person ref="alles">We</person> must support <person ref="alice"

			got up to do it, very obediently, but a little frightened.</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="alice">Thank <person ref="alles">you</person> very much,but <person ref="alice"

		</p>
		<p><q sp="redQueen">That wouldn't be at all the thing,</q> the <person ref="redQueen">Red

		<p>(<litDev type="exposition"><q sp="alice">And <person ref="redQueen whQueen">they</person>

		<p>In fact it was rather difficult for <person ref="alice">her</person> to keep in <person
				ref="alice">her</person> place while <person ref="alice">she</person> made <person
				ref="alice">her</person> speech: <person ref="redQueen whQueen">the two

				>her</person> up into the air: <q sp="alice"><person ref="alice">I</person> rise to

			<person ref="alice">Alice</person> began: and <person ref="alice">she</person> really
			DID rise as <person ref="alice">she</person> spoke, several inches; but <person
				ref="alice">she</person> got hold of the edge of the table, and managed to pull
				<person ref="alice">herself</person> down again.</p>
		<p>
			<q sp="whQueen"><imp>Take care of <person ref="alice"
				>your</person>self!</imp>Something's going to happen!</q>
		</p>
		<p>And then (<litDev type="exposition">as <person ref="alice">Alice</person> afterwards
				described it</litDev>) all sorts of things happened in a moment. The candles all
			grew up to the ceiling, looking something <litDev type="simile">like a bed of rushes
				with fireworks at the top</litDev>. <litDev type="anthropomorphism">As to the
				bottles, they each took a pair of plates, which they hastily fitted on as wings, and
				so, with forks for legs, went fluttering about in all directions</litDev>:<q
				sp="alice">and very<litDev type="simile"> like birds they look</litDev>,</q>
			<person ref="alice">Alice</person> thought to <person ref="alice">herself</person>, as
			well as <person ref="alice">she</person> could in the dreadful confusion that was
			beginning.</p>
		<p>At this moment <person ref="alice">she</person> heard a hoarse laugh at <person
				ref="alice">her</person> side, and turned to see what was the matter with the<person
				ref="whQueen">White Queen</person>; but, instead of <person ref="whQueen">the
				Queen</person>, there was <litDev type="anthropomorphism">the leg of mutton sitting
				in the chair</litDev>.<q sp="whQueen">Here <person ref="whQueen">I</person> am!</q>
			cried a voice from the soup tureen, and <person ref="alice">Alice</person> turned again,
			just in time to see the Queen's broad good-natured face grinning at <person ref="alice"
				>her</person> for a moment over the edge of the tureen, before <person ref="whQueen"
				>she</person> disappeared into the soup.</p>
		<p>There was not a moment to be lost. Already <person ref="alles">several of the
				guests</person> were lying down in the dishes, and <litDev type="anthropomorphism"
				>the soup ladle was walking up the table towards <person ref="alice"
				>Alice</person>'s chair, and beckoning to <person ref="alice">her</person>
				impatiently to get out of its way.</litDev></p>
		<p><q sp="alice"><person ref="alice">I</person> can't stand this any longer!</q>
			<person ref="alice">she</person> cried as <person ref="alice">she</person> jumped up and
			seized the table-cloth with both hands: one good pull, and <person ref="alles">plates,
				dishes, guests, and candles</person> came crashing down together in a heap on the
			floor.</p>
		<p><q sp="alice">And as for <person ref="redQueen">you</person>,</q>
			<person ref="alice">she</person> went on, turning fiercely upon the <person
				ref="redQueen">Red Queen</person>, whom <person ref="alice">she</person> considered
			as the cause of all the mischief--but <person ref="redQueen">the Queen</person> was no
			longer at <person ref="alice">her</person> side--<person ref="alice">she</person> had
			suddenly <litDev type="allit">dwindled down to the size of a little doll</litDev>, and
			was now on the table, merrily running round and round after <person ref="redQueen"
				>her</person> own shawl, which was trailing behind <person ref="redQueen"
				>her</person>.</p>
		<p>At any other time, <person ref="alice">Alice</person> would have felt surprised at this,
			but <person ref="alice">she</person> was far too much excited to be surprised at
			anything NOW.<q sp="alice">As for <person ref="alice">you</person>,<person ref="alice"

		<p>It is a very inconvenient habit of kittens (<litDev type="exposition"><person ref="alice"
