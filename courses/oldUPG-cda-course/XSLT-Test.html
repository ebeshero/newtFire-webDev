      <p>Download the XML file I have linked here from our class's Frank O'Hara Project: <a href="McDermottOHaraPoemRevision.xml">McDermottOHaraPoemRevision.xml</a>. The file contains a poem with some interesting markup that we'd like you to transform
         into HTML, according to our instructions:
         			
      </p>
      			
      <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This test will require you to write <strong>modal XSLT</strong> to produce, first, an HTML reading view of this complete poem according to our instructions
         below, followed by an unordered list of the pop culture references marked inside it
         (coded as <span class="code">&lt;ref what="popCulture"&gt;</span>.
      </p>
      			
      <p>The HTML presentation of the poem should meet the following specifications:</p>
      			
      <ol>
         				
         <li>Your HTML must be output as <strong>a valid XHTML strict file</strong>, which means you must have the appropriate <span class="code">xsl:output</span> statement to set this doctype definition.
         </li>
         				
         <li>Each <strong>stanza</strong> of the poem (marked as <span class="code">&lt;st&gt;</span>) and <strong>the date</strong> following the poem, should be held inside an HTML <span class="code">&lt;p&gt;</span> element.
         </li>
         				
         <li>Each line of the poem should be output with an HTML break element, <span class="code">&lt;br/&gt;</span>, and also so that its line number is visible and coded to be styled in CSS differently
            from the main text, like this: <span class="code">&lt;span class="number"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;</span></li>
         				
         			
         <li>The poem features some interesting examples of words broken across lines, so they
            are literally broken in half by a line break. Your HTML presentation should transform
            the contents of the <span class="code">wordBreak</span> elements so they appear bold in the HTML, using the HTML <span class="code">&lt;b&gt;</span> element.
         </li>
         				
         <li>Let's make the contents of the <span class="code">refrain</span> elements stand out by coding them with italics, using the HTML <span class="code">&lt;i&gt;</span> element. 
         </li>
         				
         <li>Write a template rule to transform all the <span class="code">ref</span> elements, using <span class="code">&lt;span class=""&gt;</span> (which would allow us to style this a particular way in CSS), and use an <strong>attribute value template</strong> to determine the value of <span class="code">@class</span>. (You don't need to write CSS for this test.)
         </li>
         				
         <li>Now, write modal XSLT to output <strong>an unordered (bulleted) list to appear after the reading view of the poem</strong>, using <span class="code">&lt;ul&gt;</span> and <span class="code">&lt;li&gt;</span> to list the contents of the Pop Culture references in this poem.
         </li>
         			
      </ol>
      	
      <p>Check your work! Be sure to open your HTML file in &lt;oXygen/&gt; to be sure it is valid
         and well-formed, and modify your XSLT accordingly. When you are finished, <strong>upload only your XSLT file</strong> in <a href="https://courseweb.pitt.edu">Courseweb</a> in "Tests" at the designated upload point for the XSLT exam. We only need to see
         your XSLT file.
