start = root

root = element root {(head | body)*}
#root = element root {(head, body) | (body, head)}
# grouping with parentheses, and using a pipe. head, body indicates that head should appear first, and then body
# but we could also write this using an interleave connector, like this:
# root = element root {head & body} The ampersand (or interleave connector) means that these elements can appear in any order.
# better yet, we DON'T need the interleave connector at all. Think of it this way: 
# root = element root {(head | body)*}

head = element head {title}
title = element title {text}
body = element body {chapter}

chapter = element chapter {mixed {(paragraph | listing)*}}

# We've got a problem here because "list" is a reserved word in Relax-NG. 
# We have a couple of workarounds. One is to "escape" the reserved word with a backslash, like this: \list
# Or we can just give it a different label, and call it "listing" as we've done here. 
# Either way is fine, and you can still use the word "list" as the name of the element in your rule. 

item = element item {mixed {listing*}}

# * means zero or more (optional AND repeatable: the most flexible representation)
# + means 1 or more times. you MUST have at least one of these, and may have more than one
# ? zero or 1, this is optional, but if it occurs, it can only be there ONCE. (Use the * if you want it to be able to occur more than once.)
# nothing at all: this must appear, and only once.
