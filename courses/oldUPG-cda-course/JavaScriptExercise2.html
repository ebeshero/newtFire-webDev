      <p>This exercise will give you experience with:</p>
      <ul>
         				
         <li>coordinating JavaScript with HTML and CSS,</li>
         				
         <li>writing a separate JavaScript file (as well as a separate CSS file) that
            					you associate with your HTML in its <span class="code">&lt;head&gt;</span>
            					element,
         </li>
         				
         <li>and working with an adaptable JavaScript function called <span class="code">classList()</span>, in conjunction with the adaptable HTML <span class="code">&lt;span class=""&gt;</span> code and CSS styling of <span class="code">span.whateverClassNameYouLike</span>.
         </li>
         			
      </ul>
      			
      <p>For this assignment, we would like you to write JavaScript that you adapt to an HTML
         				file that is either part of your project or related in some way to your project
         				development. Prepare an HTML file that uses <span class="code">&lt;span class=""&gt;</span> code in some way useful to you, and work with styling it for toggling in some way.
         You may wish to create buttons to press in your HTML, or a series of checkboxes, or
         some other way that makes sense to you to invite users to do something on click, or
         on some mouse event. (In our work, we have typically used the HTML <span class="code">&lt;fieldset&gt;</span> with checkboxes, which is what is featured in the tutorial connected with this assignment.)
         Read more about HTML input elements at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp">w3schools here</a>.
      </p>
      			
      <p>Before you begin (and as you are coding), read and apply Elisa's tutorial, <a href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/javascript/classListToggle.xhtml">"JavaScript toggling with classList and switch,"</a> which walks you through how to integrate the three kinds of code for users to toggle
         effects on code you have tagged with <span class="code">&lt;span class="whateverClassNameYouLikeHere"&gt;</span>. Elisa prepared this tutorial for Obdurodon based on her work on JavaScript for the
         Pacific Project, and we would like you to try your hand at applying and adapting it
         to your own projects, since classList() can coordinate effectively with many JavaScript
         events (changing colors, showing or hiding content, etc). 
      </p>
      			
      <p>Your assignment is to apply the guidance in the tutorial: Write a separate JavaScript
         file that activates toggling on some kind of mouse event in your HTML <span class="code">&lt;span class=""&gt;</span> elements, by adding (and removing) a CSS class (usually <span class="code">"on"</span>). Your CSS code should accommodate spans with the additional class and spans without
         that class so it is clear what display you want to see when an effect is toggled on
         or off.
      </p>
      			
      <p><strong>What to submit on Courseweb:</strong> your HTML file, your JavaScript file, and your CSS file.
