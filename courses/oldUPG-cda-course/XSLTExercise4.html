       <section id="input_text"> <h3>The input text</h3>
        <p>In this exercise, we work with an XML file originally coded by a Pitt student for a project on the Skyrim legends based on the video game. The XML code is available at <a href="skyrim.xml">http://dh.newtfire.org/skyrim.xml</a>. You should
            right-click on this link, download the file, and open it in &lt;oXygen/&gt;.
            (You don’t need the Relax NG schema, but if you’d like to look at it and associate it with the file, it’s available at
            <a href="skyrim.rnc">http://dh.newtfire.org/skyrim.rnc</a>).</p></section>
       <section id="xslt_root"> <h3>The usual housekeeping:</h3>
        <p>Because this document is not in a namespace, we do not need the
            <code>@xpath-default-namespace</code> attribute, and the only thing we need to add
            to &lt;oXygen&gt;’s default XSLT stylesheet template. We also add our usual
            <code>&lt;xsl:output&gt;</code> line that we use when producing HTML (for making
            sure we produce valid HTML 5 in XHTML format). Here’s what we need:</p>
        <pre>
          &lt;xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
    xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"

        </pre></section>
       <section id="overview"> <h3>Overview of the assignment</h3>
        <p>We will be preparing HTML reading view styled for the web, based on the original XML document. We’re going to work with the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element,
            concentrating on processing the in-line elements to style the text. You can use some of
            the basic HTML in-line elements, like <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> for emphasis or
            <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> for strong emphasis, but you’ll also want to use CSS to
            set some elements to different colors or background colors or borders or fonts or font
            sizes or font styles (e.g., italic) or font weights (e.g., bold) or text decoration
            (e.g., underlining) or text transformation (e.g., convert to all upper case) … well …
            anything else. We describe below how to do that.</p>
        <p>There are six types of in-line elements in the input XML document:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>&lt;QuestEvent&gt;</code></li>
            <li><code>&lt;QuestItem&gt;</code></li>
            <li><code>&lt;character&gt;</code></li>
            <li><code>&lt;epithet&gt;</code></li>
            <li><code>&lt;faction&gt;</code></li>
            <li><code>&lt;location&gt;</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some are immediately inside a <code>&lt;paragraph&gt;</code> and some are inside other
            elements that are inside paragraphs. You may not know at the outset which ones can be
            inside which other ones, or how deeply they can nest. Happily, with XSLT, unlike with
            many other programming languages, you don’t need to care about those questions!</p></section>
       <section id="processMixedContent"> <h3>How to process richly mixed content</h3>
        <p>Prose paragraphs with in-line elements that might contain other in-line elements are
            richly mixed content, with varied and unpredictable combinations of elements and plain
            text. This is the problem that XSLT was designed to solve. With a traditional procedural
            programming language, you’d have to write rules like <q>inside this paragraph, if
                there’s a <code>&lt;QuestEvent&gt;</code> do X, and, oh, by the way, check whether
                there’s a <code>&lt;QuestItem&gt;</code> or a <code>&lt;location&gt;</code> inside
                the <code>&lt;QuestEvent&gt;</code>, etc.</q> That is, most programming languages
            have to tell you what to look for at every step. The elegance of XSLT when dealing with
            this type of data is that all you have to say inside paragraphs and other elements is,
            <q>I’m not worried about what I'll find here; just process (apply templates to) all
                my children, whatever they might be.</q></p>
        <p>The way to deal with mixed content in XSLT is to have a template rule for every element
            and use it to output whatever HTML markup you want for that element and then, inside
            that markup, to include a general <code>&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;</code>, not
            specifying a <code>@select</code> attribute. For example, if you want your
            <code>&lt;QuestEvent&gt;</code> to be tagged with the HTML
            <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> tags, which means <q>strong emphasis</q> and which is
            usually rendered in bold, you could have a template rule like:</p>
        <pre>&lt;xsl:template match="QuestEvent"&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
      &lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;
  &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;</pre>
        <p>You don’t know or care whether <code>&lt;QuestEvent&gt;</code> has any child nodes or, if
            it does, what they are. Whatever they are, this rule tells the system to try to process
            them, and as long as there’s a template rule for them, they’ll get taken care of
            properly somewhere else in the stylesheet. If there are no child nodes, the
            <code>&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;</code> will apply harmlessly (as there will be nothing to process). As
            long as every element tells you to process its children, you’ll work your way down
            through the hierarchy of the paragraph without having to know which elements can contain
            which other elements or text nodes.</p></section>
      <section id="select_att">  <h3>Taking stock: when to use <code>@select</code></h3>
        <p>In the previous XSLT assignment, where you built HTML tables from XML-coded survey data,
            you used <code>&lt;xsl:apply-templates select="…"/&gt;</code>, specifying exactly what
            you wanted to process where. That makes sense when your input (those <code>&lt;fs&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;f&gt;</code> elements and their special attributes) and your output (an
            HTML table) are very regular in structure. <em>Use the <code>@select</code> attribute
                when you know exactly what you’re looking for and where you want to put it.</em></p>
        <p>In this assignment, on the other hand, you don’t know (and don’t need to know) the order
            and nesting hierarchy of whatever <q>tossed salad</q> of elements and plain text you might find inside
            a paragraph or its subelements. You just want to process whatever comes up whenever it
            comes up. <code>&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;</code> without the <code>@select</code>
            attribute says <q>apply templates to whatever you find.</q>
            <em>The upshot: Omit the <code>@select</code> attribute when you are processing lots of different mixed up alternatives and you do not need to rearrange them.</em> (You can still treat them all
            differently because you’ll have different template rules to <q>match</q> them, but when
            you assert that they should be processed, you don’t have to know which ones they actually
            are.)</p></section>
        <section id="stylingOutput"><h3>Styling your output: HTML and CSS</h3>
        <p>HTML provides a limited number of elements for styling in-line text, which you can read
            about at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_formatting.asp"
                >http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_formatting.asp</a>. You can use any of these in
            your output, but note that presentational elements, the kind that describe how text
            looks (e.g., <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> for <q>italic</q>), are generally regarded as less
            useful than descriptive tags, which describe what text means (e.g.,
            <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> for <q>emphasis</q>). Both of the preceding are normally
            rendered in italics in the browser, but the semantic tag is more consistent with the
            spirit of XML than the presentational one.</p>
        <p>The web would be a dull world if the only styling available were the handful of
            presentational tags available in vanilla HTML. In addition to those options, there are
            also ways to assign arbitrary style to a snippet of in-line text, changing fonts or
            colors or other features in mid-stream. To do that:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Before you read any further in this page, read our <a
                href="explainHTMLSpanClass.html">Using
                <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> and <code>@class</code> to style your HTML</a>
                page.</p></li>
            <li><p>To use the strategies described at that page, create an XSLT template rule that
                transforms the element you want to style to an HTML <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>
                element with a <code>@class</code> attribute. For example, you might transform
                <code>&lt;faction ref="MythicDawn"&gt;assassins&lt;/faction&gt;</code> in
                the input XML to <code>&lt;span
                    class="MythicDawn"&gt;assassins&lt;/span&gt;</code> in the output HTML. You
                can then specify CSS styling by reference to the <code>@class</code> attribute,
                as described in the page we link to above.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Note that you can make your transformations very specific. For example,
                        instead of setting all <code>&lt;faction&gt;</code> elements to the same
                        HTML <code>@class</code>, you can create separate template rules to match on
                        factions according to their attribute values. For example,
                        <code>&lt;xsl:template match="faction[@ref='MythicDawn']"&gt;</code> is
                        a normal XPath expression to match <code>&lt;faction&gt;</code> elements
                        only if they have a <code>@ref</code> attribute with the value
                        <q>MythicDawn</q>.</li>
                    <li>If you really want to exercise your XPath skills, note that in the header
                        some factions are described (with an <code>@alignment</code> attribute) as
                        <q>evil</q>, <q>good</q>, or <q>neutral</q>. You can write a matching
                        rule that will <dfn>dereference</dfn> the <code>@ref</code> attribute on,
                        say, <code>&lt;faction ref="MythicDawn"&gt;assassins&lt;/faction&gt;</code>,
                        look up whether this is an evil, good, or neutral faction, and set the
                        <code>@class</code> value accordingly. You could make all good factions
                        one color and all evil factions a different color, letting XPath look up the
                        moral alignment of a faction for you.</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li><p>Setting the <code>@class</code> attributes in the output HTML makes it possible
                to style the various <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements differently according to
                the value of those attributes, but you need to create a CSS stylesheet to do
                that. Create the stylesheet (just as you‘ve created CSS in the past), and
                specify how you want to style your <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements. Link the
                CSS stylesheet to the HTML you are outputting by creating the appropriate
                <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element in your output HTML (you can remind
                yourself how to do that here <a
                    href="http://dh.newtfire.org/explainCSS.html#link_CSS">in this section of our Intro to
                    CSS</a>). You should set that <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element in your XSLT so it is always output every time you update your code.</p></li>
        </ol></section>
       <section id="finishingUp"> <h3>When the smoke clears</h3>
        <p>What you should produce, then, is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>An XSLT stylesheet that transforms the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element and its
                contents into HTML.</li>
            <li>The resulting HTML should style the six types of in-line elements listed above. At
                least some of those styles should be set using <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements
                with the <code>@class</code> attribute.</li>
            <li>You need to create a CSS file, linked to your output HTML, that specifies how to
                style the output document. You can look up the most useful of the available CSS
                properties at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/"
                    >http://www.w3schools.com/css/</a>. We’d suggesting following the links on the
