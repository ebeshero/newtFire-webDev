		  <h2>Reflection Assignment: English Sailors and Tahitian Expectations</h2>
			
		<p>Voyage accounts from the 1760s and 1770s hold a record of people from very different kinds of societies attempting to make sense of each other, attempting to fit each other into their worlds. All parties involved in cultural contact experience will emerge from it changed, with new stories to tell, and big questions about human behavior, rules or &quot;taboos&quot; apparently respected or broken. </p>
			<p>Think about what you learned about chiefdoms and Polynesian societies from class on Mon. 11/11. Before class on Wed. 11/13, we'd like you to read <b><a href="https://pitt.box.com/s/xsrtpubyp0b98fd21m9u">a brief passage (posted on Box)</a></b> of three paragraphs from Cook's Second Voyage account, and write a short reponse paper reflecting on the description of cultural encounters on board ship and on the Tahitian shore. </p>
				<ul><li>How is Otoo's chiefly authority represented in the passage? How about the authority of &quot;me&quot; and &quot;we&quot;--Cook and his officers? <br/><br/></li>
				  <li>Clothing, music, dancing, and performance are all important in this passage. How do each of these raise questions for the English viewers? 
				  <br/><br/></li>
			    
					<li>We developed <b><a href="https://pitt.box.com/s/hn3xzsak70w6rm4tm3fd">a tagging system (our Coding Handout in Box)</a></b> last spring that we need to revisit now, and reconsider how we're tagging cultural interactions in particular--focusing on section 5 (on the Referencing String, or <span class="code">rs</span> markup). Following our guidelines, we'd probably code spans of this passage as <span class="code">&lt;rs type=&quot;interact&quot; subtype=&quot;affin&quot;&gt;</span> to indicate friendly relations, and other passages as <span class="code">&lt;rs type=&quot;interact&quot; subtype=&quot;trade&quot;&gt;</span> to indicate exchanges of objects. We can further define the cultural markup with one more, optional, attribute, <span class="code">@role</span>, which could be used to describe a kind of interaction, involving ritual ceremony, involving violence, or involving sexual behavior in some way. <b>Try your hand at tagging passages in this text in oXygen, following these markup guidelines (and save your work to submit with your paper).</b> <br/><br/></li> 
					<li>In the last paragraph of your paper reflect: <b>What modifications to <span class="code">@subtype</span> or <span class="code">@role</span> might make sense for our markup of interactions? Or, as you think about how to use these on the passage we're reading, what questions or issues might you have with using this markup?</b>  </li> </ul>
