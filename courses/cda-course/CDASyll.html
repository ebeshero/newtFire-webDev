            <h2>All the Tools You Need As We Begin:</h2>
            
            
            <p>Download and install the following software on your own personal computer(s) on or
               before the first day of class. These software tools are available in our campus computing
               labs, too.
            </p>

                  <strong>All students:</strong>
                  <a href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/">&lt;oXygen/&gt;</a>. The University of
                  Pittsburgh has purchased a site license for this software, which is installed in
                  the Pitt computer labs on multiple campuses, and it’s in use in courses here at
                  Greensburg and at Oakland. The license also permits students enrolled in the
                  course to install the software on their home computers (for course-related use
                  only). When installing this on your own computers, <strong>you will need the
                     license key</strong>, which we have posted on our course Announcements section of
                  <a href="https://courseweb.pitt.edu">Courseweb</a>.
               </li>
               
               <li>All students require a good means of secure file transfer (SFTP) for homework
                  assignments and projects (also available in the campus computer labs). There are
                  several good options available. We recommend you download and install on your own
                  computers one (or more) of the following, depending on your platform: (Feel free
                  to experiment with these and others!)

               <li>This course fulfills general education requirements in Q2, SS, and HM, and it fulfills
                  a core requirement for <a href="http://greensburg.pitt.edu/academics/info/digital-studies">the Digital Studies Certificate at Pitt-Greensburg</a>. Think about where this course might fit in your academic career, and how you might
                  apply the skills you learn here.
               </li>
               
               <li>No coding experience? Don’t worry! You are in very good company. We don’t expect any
                  of you to have written a line of computer code before now. Past students in this course
                  who never saw anything like markup or XML code have designed projects (<a href="http://newtfire.org/dh/studentProjects.html">like these</a>) and even spoken about them at an undergraduate conference! You’ll help continue
                  some of these projects we’ve started, and you’ll learn to build and create digital
                  tools for yourself with skills we hope you will keep developing.

                        Using your Git Bash Shell, practice some basic Git commands to build a habit: Always

                        DHClass-Hub. For extra credit, push more than twice to your personal repo <strong>and</strong> the DHClass-Hub.
