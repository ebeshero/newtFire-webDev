            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p>Maps, at their most basic, are symbolic, visual representations of elements arranged
                in a space. From the ancient maps, originating in Mesopotamia, of the night sky to
                modern maps of Subway system, maps have been guiding people and graphically
                depicting spatial relationships for centuries. Geographic information systems, or
                GIS, are computer systems intended to capture, store, check, and display geographic
                data, or data related to positions on Earth’s surface (<a
                    href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/geographic-information-system-gis/"
                    rel="nofollow">National Geographic</a>). Some popular GIS systems include
                ArcGIS, QGIS, Google Earth Pro, and MapInfo. This tutorial focuses on QGIS.</p>
            <p>From the <a href="https://qgis.org/en/site/about/index.html" rel="nofollow">QGIS
                    website</a>, “QGIS is a professional GIS application that is built on top of and
                proud to be itself Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)… It runs on Linux, Unix, Mac
                OS X, Windows, and Android and supports numerous vector, raster, and database
                formats and functionalities.” It is an official project of the Open Source
                Geospatial Foundation, or OSGeo, whose “mission is to foster global adoption of open
                geospatial technology by being an inclusive software foundation devoted to an open
                philosophy and participatory community driven development (<a
                    href="https://www.osgeo.org/about/" rel="nofollow">OSGeo</a>). As part of this
                movement and as stated above, QGIS is open-source software, which means that its
                source code is publicly available to be modified and contributed to; this means that
                it by principle is free to use.</p>
            <p>To download QGIS, go to <a href="https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html"
                    rel="nofollow">Download QGIS</a> and select the installer appropriate for your
                operating system, such as Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux Ubuntu. Please take care to
                download version 3.4.15 - Madeira or a newer version. This tutorial was created with
                3.4.15 in mind, and so later versions might look slightly different, though the
                functionality will still be the same. Earlier versions, such as 2.18, will look very
                different, and if you install a version earlier than 3.0 you might have serious
                difficulty following along with the tutorial. Let me know if downloading an earlier
                version of QGIS (earlier than 3.0) is necessary for you.</p>
            <h2 id="user-content-projects-and-layers">Projects and Layers</h2>
            <p>In QGIS, we work in Projects. To create a new project, first open QGIS. One option
                would be to click the icon of a piece of white paper in the upper left-hand corner
                of the page. It is circled in red in the image below.</p>
            <p>

                </a>
            </p>
            <p>Alternatively, you could hit the “Project” button in the ribbon at the top of the
                page and then select “New Project” from the resulting dropdown menu. It is circled
                in red in the image below.</p>
            <p>
                <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"

                </a>
            </p>
            <p>Another option, evident with the image of the menu above, is to use the shortcut
                Command-N (for Mac OS X users) or Control-N (for Windows or Linux users).</p>
            <p>Once you have created a new project, your QGIS screen should be blank, like the
                following image.</p>

            <p>QGIS, like all GIS, “analyzes spatial location and organizations layers of
                information into visualizations using maps and 3D scenes. With this unique
                capability, [it] reveals deeper insights into data, such as patterns, relationships,
                and situations” (<a href="https://www.esri.com/en-us/what-is-gis/overview"
                    rel="nofollow">ESRI</a>). It utilizes layers to allow users to dive deep into a
                location and glean more information from it than traditional maps may have allowed.
                Layers are added to a project to create a map.</p>
            <p>Next, you’ll add your first layer to the QGIS project, the base layer: the
                OpenStreetMaps XYZ Tiles. An XYZ Tile Layer is “a set of web-accessible tiles that
                reside on a server. The tiles are accessed by a direct URL request from the web
                browser” (<a href="https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/10.3/use/tile-layers.htm"
                    rel="nofollow">Tile layers—Portal for ArcGIS (10.3 and 10.3.1) | ArcGIS
                    Enterprise</a>). As such, you’ll need an Internet connection to first add this
                layer to your project; however, it’s essentially a base map of the world that
                OpenStreetMaps, another open-source project, provides for free from their
                server.</p>
            <p>To add the OpenStreetMap XYZ Tile Layer to your project, go to the Browser menu on
                the left-hand side of the page and select “XYZ Tiles.” The option “OpenStreetMap”
                should appear below “XYZ Tiles,” as pictured below.</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>Double click on “OpenStreetMap” to add the layer to your project. Your QGIS page
                should now look like the image below, with a map of the world where the blank white
                space used to be.</p>

            <p>You should notice that now “OpenStreetMap” is present in the “Layers” menu, which is
                beneath the “Browser” menu. One other thing to notice is that there is a checkmark
                next to the layer name, which means that that layer should be visible on the map. To
                deactivate that layer, click on the checkbox to remove the checkmark; you should
                then see the map of the world disappear from view.</p>
            <h2 id="user-content-delimited-text-layers">Delimited Text Layers</h2>
            <p>Next, we will import a TSV (tab-separated values) file and use it to generate another
                layer, which we will place on top of our base map.</p>
            <p>Please download the following text file, which is a TSV file with the latitude and
                longitude coordinates of all significant earthquakes since 2150 BC from NOAA’s
                National Geophysical Data Center. Save this to your computer as a .txt file, a .csv
                file, or a .tsv file. This data in this file is separated by tabs, which makes it
                technically a tab-separated value (TSV) file. Any file that contains data separated
                by a specific character is a delimited text file, so as long as you save it as one
                of those, you will be fine.</p>

            </p>
            <p>If you open this file and examine it, you’ll notice that there is a column for
                latitude coordinates and a column for longitude coordinates. Those are the two most
                essential columns in this document for creating a layer in QGIS: the X and Y
                coordinates of the locations you want to map.</p>
            <p>Quite simply, the X coordinates will be the longitude coordinates and the Y
                coordinates will be the latitude coordinates. Why?</p>
            <p>Remember the Cartesian coordinate plane.</p>

            <p>The y-axis goes up and down; it is vertical. Conversely, the x-axis goes from left to
                right; it is horizontal.</p>
            <p>Now, remember latitude and longitude lines.</p>

                    rel="nofollow">What Is Longitude and Latitude?</a></p>
            <p>Like the x-axis, lines of latitude go from left to right across the globe; they are
                horizontal. Similarly, the lines of longitude, like the y-axis, are vertical. As
                such, the X coordinates of the table are the latitude coordinates, and the Y
                coordinates of the table are longitude coordinates.</p>
            <p>To import a document into QGIS, its data must be in some way connected to location.
                Perhaps the easiest connection to make is for each row in the table to have X and Y
                coordinates. Otherwise, you’ll have to join tables, which is something that we will
                get into later.</p>
            <h3 id="user-content-making-your-own-delimited-text-layer">Making Your Own Delimited Text Layer</h3>
            <p>If you have project data that you would like to map, you can create your own CSV or
                TSV files to import as Delimited Text Layers. For a good introduction on how to
                generate a TSV from project data with XQuery or XSLT, please refer to Dr. B’s (<a
                    href="http://ebeshero.github.io/thalaba/cytosc.html" rel="nofollow">XML to
                    Cytoscape Tutorial</a>) While that tutorial is focused on generating a TSV or
                CSV specifically for Cytoscape or network analysis, it is still useful for
                explaining the basic concepts of how to construct and output a text-delimited, such
                as TSV or CSV, file. You’ll want to do the same kind of thing to make a delimited
                text file for QGIS.</p>
            <p>However, one thing to note is that unlike text-delimited files created for network
                analysis, text-delimited files created for QGIS do not need to use concepts like
                “edge” or “node.” Unlike network analysis, with QGIS you are not graphically
                representing relationships of association or connection in your data; you are
                representing <em>spatial</em> relationships of data that is somehow related to
                location or place.</p>
            <p>As such, you really only need two columns in a text-delimited file to import it into
                QGIS as a delimited text layer: a column for latitude coordinates and a column for
                longitude coordinates. Other columns of course can be present and may be useful, but
                they would need to be tied to specific geodata, or latitude and longitude
                coordinates; for example, perhaps you have columns for latitude and longitude along
                with a column with the name of each place represented by the coordinates. As long as
                the information included in the other columns of the CSV or TSV are tied to the
                coordinates, you can have as many of them as you should so desire.</p>
            <p>There is a very simple example below of a CSV that could be imported into QGIS.</p>
            <p>
                <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                    href="/ebeshero/DHClass-Hub/blob/master/Assignments/QGIS/qgis_intro/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-09%20at%202.20.09%20PM%202.png">
                    <img
                        src="/ebeshero/DHClass-Hub/raw/master/Assignments/QGIS/qgis_intro/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-09%20at%202.20.09%20PM%202.png"
                        alt="" style="max-width:100%;">
                </a>
            </p>
            <p>As you can see, there are two rows and four columns for this CSV. This is viewed
                through GitHub’s file viewer, and so the actual commas that separate each of the
                values are hidden from view so that the table is more readable, but they are there
                nonetheless.</p>
            <p>The first column is a unique ID attribute for each of the places; it is merely the
                number of the row. It’s very good practice to have a unique ID for every row of any
                table that you want to include in a database, such as QGIS. I will refrain from
                getting into the normalization process, but a file cannot be a table in a database
                until it has a unique identifier for every row. In practice, unique identifiers can
                be extremely useful because they are a means by which you can identify any specific
                row; furthermore, they do not necessarily have to be numeric. The only condition is
                that they are unique. In this case, it is perhaps a bit redundant to use the row
                number, because there are only two places. The latitude or longitude coordinates
                themselves could be unique identifiers. However, if I’d included a place in a table
                more than once, then that system would fail, and one always wants to imagine what
                could go wrong in the case that one might expand the table when one creates the
                table in the first place. In short, that’s what that column is and why it’s
                there.</p>
            <p>The second column, “lat,” holds the latitude coordinates for each of the locations.
                Similarly, the third column “lon” contains the longitude coordinates.</p>
            <p>Finally, the fourth column, “place_name”, contains the names of the locations
                described by the latitude and longitude coordinates in the second and third
                columns.</p>

                Creation of QGIS Layers and How to Make it Suitable for such Endeavors</h3>
            <p>As implied by the section above, your project data will be suitable for QGIS mapping
                if it <em>includes latitude and longitude coordinates</em>. This of course implies
                that there is something in your project to do with actual, physical locations that
                could be mapped.</p>
            <p>(Note: If, perhaps, your project works with fictional locations, then another option
                that you might want to consider is image mapping. In this case, you take a picture
                of a fictional map, then perhaps convert it to an SVG with some tools that Dr. B can
                tell you about, and then use image mapping, also something Dr. B can tell you more
                about, to draw shapes on the picture of the map, so that you can add layers and add
                meaning to the map that way.)</p>
            <p><strong>If your project has something to do with real locations, but you do not have
                    latitude and longitude coordinates in your XML,</strong> then you will need to
                put latitude and longitude coordinates in your XML so that you can then extract such
                data using XSLT or XQuery.</p>
            <h4 id="user-content-where-to-find-latitude-and-longitude-coordinates">Where to Find Latitude and Longitude Coordinates</h4>
            <p>Perhaps the simplest way to go about putting latitude and longitude coordinates into
                your XML is to go manually look them up and manually type them into attribute values
                or an element or so on.</p>
            <p>Good places to manually find latitude and longitude coordinates using place names or
                other reference data are <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=4/38.01/-95.84"
                    rel="nofollow">OpenStreetMap</a> and <a
                    href="https://www.google.com/maps?client=safari" rel="nofollow">Google Maps</a>.
                With both of these places, you can just search for your location in the search
                bar.</p>
            <p>In Google Maps, you will then be presented with a map with a pin on it representing
                your location. To find the latitude and longitude coordinates, right click on the
                pin, and then click “More Info about this Point.”</p>
            <p>You’ll then be presented with a box like the one in the image below.</p>

            <p>OpenStreetMap recognizes that there might be slight variation or error in any
                geocoordinates they provide you with (feel free to read up on the creation of
                geodata and satellite triangulation etc. for more on that), so it provides you with
                a range of values, representing both ends of the range where the location may be:
                the minimum and maximum values for the longitude and latitude coordinates. I’ve
                labelled each of the numeric values in the image above. You’ll have to decide
                whether you want to go with the maximum or minimum values—just be sure to be
                consistent; for example, don’t mix them up and take the max latitude coordinate of a
                location along with the minimum longitude coordinate.</p>
            <p>With these, you can then copy and paste the coordinates into your XML.</p>
            <p>Alternatively, if you click “Export” beneath the OpenStreetMap licensing information,
                you can download a .osm file, which is in fact an XML file. You can then use XSLT to
                integrate the latitude and longitude coordinates held in that file into your XML
                code. The latitude and longitude coordinates, again in a range, are held in the
                    <code>bounds</code>element of this .osm file, in the attributes
                    <code>minlat</code>, <code>minlon</code>, <code>maxlat</code>, and
                    <code>maxlon</code>. You can reference Dr. B’s tutorials and assignments on
                XSLT, published at dh.newtfire.org, for more on how to do that.</p>

                locations, it may be easier to utilize an API. Reference <a

            <p>There are other types of layers, such as Vector layers or Raster layers, but we will
                worry about those later.</p>
            <p>You will then be faced with a screen that looks like this one.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Click on the three dots next to “File Name” to navigate to the file, signif.txt,
                    that you downloaded earlier.</li>
                <li>As a default, the layer will be named signif. However, that name is fairly
                    meaningless out of context. Rename the layer in the text box next to “Layer
                    Name” to something meaningful.</li>
                <li>Unless you saved the document as a CSV file, then you will have to select
                    “Custom Delimeters” and make sure that the box next to “Tab” is selected.</li>
                <li>As you might recall, the first row of the document includes the column names. As
                    such, you’ll want to make sure that the box next to “First record has field
                    names” is checked. If you look at the bottom of the page at the Sample Data, you
                    should then see the column names grayed out or differentiated by color from the
                    actual data.</li>
                <li>Next, you’ll want to select the columns named LONGITUDE and LATITUDE in the
                    drop-down menus next to “X Field” and “Y Field.” As mentioned earlier, LONGITUDE
                    should be in the X Field, and LATITUDE should be in the Y Field. (If you have
                    Detect Field Types selected, then it’s possible that these fields will already
                    be correctly selected.)</li>
                <li>Finally, you’ll want to select the appropriate Coordinate Reference System
                    (CRS). I will err on the side of simplicity and not go into what a CRS is or how
                    it works, but you should just trust me that you should choose the Default CRS:
                    WGS 84.</li>
                <li>Click Add.</li>

                “earthquakes” layer, then it would disappear on the map, because the base map
                “OpenStreetMap” would then be layered on top of it; it would cover it and render it

            <p>Once you click “Add Map,” the “Add Map” mode will be activated. Click and drag a
                square on the white canvas to add a map to that square.</p>

            <p>You should end up with an image like the one above.</p>
            <p>Next, click the “Item Properties” tab on the right-hand side of the page and make
                sure that the boxes next to “Lock layers” and “Lock styles for layers” are
                checked.</p>

            <p>Then, navigate to the main QGIS window. Use the Pan and Zoom tools to zoom in on the
                San Francisco Bay Area. We will use this area as an inset on our larger map.</p>
            <p>Next, right click on the “earthquakes” layer in the “Layers” menu. In the pop up
                menu, click on “Styles” and use the resulting color wheel to choose a new color for
                the points on the map marking where the earthquakes occurred. Try to make it one
                that is brighter or more noticeable than the original color of the symbols.</p>

            <p>Switch back to the “Print Layout” menu, and again select “Add Item” and then “Add
                Map.”</p>
            <p>This time, use the cursor to drag a smaller square on top of the preexisting map of
                California, perhaps in a corner or off to the side where it won’t cover any data
                points.</p>

            <p>Now, we want to make the inset look better with a frame and highlight the area from
                which the inset was taken.</p>
            <p>In the “Items” menu on the right-hand side of the page, select “Map 2,” which is the
                inset map. Click on the “Item Properties” tab, and then make sure that the button
                next to “Frame is checked.” A menu should then appear, and you should change the
                thickness to 1.0 and hit “Enter” on your keyboard. A border should appear around the
                inset.</p>

            <p>Now, select “Map 1”, the larger map, from the “Item” list. Select the “Item
                Properties” tab, and then scroll down to the “Overviews” section. Click on the green
                plus sign to add an overview; once you have done that, select “Map 2” as the Map
                frame. This indicates that Map 1, the larger map, should be highlighted with the
                selection from Map 2, the inset map.</p>

            <p>Next, we’ll add a label to the top of the map. Go to “Add Item” at the top ribbon,
                and then hover over “Add Shape,” and then click on “Add Rectangle.” Then use your
                cursor to drag out a rectangle on top of the map, preferably away from the inset and
                the majority of the data points.</p>

            <p>To color the rectangle, make sure that it is selected in the “Item” list, then go to
                “Style”; to change the color to match the map underneath it, then go to “Symbol
                Selector,” then “Select Color,” and then choose the tab to sample a color. You can
                then use a dropper to select a color from the background map for the background of
                your label.</p>
            <p>Next, to actually add a label to the map, go to “Add Item” and then “Add Label.” You
                can then change the font and label as you should so choose, using the Appearance
                menu on the right-hand side of the page.</p>

            <p>Finally, for the last touch that we’ll be putting on this map, go to “Add Item,” and
