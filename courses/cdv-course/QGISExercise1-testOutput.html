      <p>With this assignment, you’ll be working with the <a href="http://pokemon.newtfire.org" rel="nofollow">Pokemon Map Project</a> to create a map in QGIS that shows where
         certain Pokemon types are located.</p>
      <p>It has been theorized that the Pokemon region of Kanto corresponds to the Japanese
         locale
         of the same name. Using <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_world_in_relation_to_the_real_world" rel="nofollow">this source,</a> we manually inserted some geocoordinates into some
         of the preexisting Pokemon XML files, which enables the locations, the landmark
         elements, to be placed on a QGIS map. The goal of this assignment is to use that
         collection of XML files with geocoordinates to create a map of where certain Pokemon
         types would exist in the real world.</p>
      <h2 id="collecting-the-data">Collecting the Data</h2>
      <p>A collection of carefully curated XML files from the Pokemon Map Project is in <a href="http://newtfire.org:8338/exist/apps/eXide/index.html" rel="nofollow">eXide</a>, in '_db/2020_ClassExamples/pokemonQGIS/'. Your first task is to write an
         XQuery script that runs over that collection and creates a TSV that can be used to
         create a text-delimited layer in QGIS.</p>
      <p>Open one of the Pokemon files in that collection and think about in particular how
         you’d
         access the Pokemon type name, the name of the landmark, the <code>lat</code>attribute,
         and the <code>lon</code> attribute with XPath. More specifically, you’re going to want
         to find the Pokemon type, find the locations associated with that type, and then find
         the latitude and longitude coordinates associated with each of the locations.</p>
      <p>You’ll want your output to look like the following image.</p>
      <p>
         <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="qgis_1/screenshot_pokeData.png">
            <img alt="" style="max-width:100%;" src="qgis_1/screenshot_pokeData.png" />
            </a>
         </p>
      <p>As you can see, the first column of the result TSV contains the Pokemon type, the
         second
         contains the name of the location, the third contains the latitude coordinate, and
         the
         fourth contains the longitude coordinate.</p>
      <p>Hint: You’ve already done the bulk of the work needed to produce this TSV in completing
         the XQuery 2 assignment. To access the latitude and longitude coordinates, you’ll
         need
         another for loop: one that iterates through the distinct landmark values. In that
         for
         loop, you can then navigate down to the <code>lat</code> attribute that matches up with
         both the type iterating variable and the landmark iterating value. You’ll need to
         use
         two predicates. Then, you can use a very similar line of code to access the
         <code>lon</code> attribute. Finally, be sure to take only the distinct values of the
         <code>lat</code> and <code>lon</code> attributes because there are duplicate values
         for those.</p>
      <p>Be sure to output your XQuery as a TSV file (or a CSV file, if you’re feeling bold),
         and
         then save it to your computer.</p>
      <h2 id="making-the-map">Making the Map</h2>
      <h3 id="using-qgis-plugins">Using QGIS Plugins</h3>
      <p>In the QGIS Tutorial, we used the OpenStreetMap XYZ Tile Layer as a base map. In that
         tutorial, we focused on making a map of California; however, you may have noticed,
         if
         you navigated to other countries on the map, that the labels for those countries used
         the languages spoken in those places. The labels on the Japanese portion of the map,
         for
         example, are in Japanese.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, since that layer is owned by OpenStreetMaps, there isn’t a way for
         us to
         alter that. As such, for this assignment we’ll need to install a QGIS Plugin to access
         alternate base maps.</p>
      <p>To install a plugin, navigate to the “Plugins” section of the top ribbon, then click
         “Manage and Install Plugins” in the resulting dropdown menu.</p>
      <p>
         <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="qgis_1/ScreenShot2020-03-11at12.10.42PM2.png">
            <img alt="" style="max-width:100%;" src="qgis_1/ScreenShot2020-03-11at12.10.42PM2.png" />
            </a>
         </p>
      <p>You’ll then be presented with the Plugins window. The plugin that we want to install
         is
         called “QuickMapServices,” so click on “All” in the menu on the left-hand side of
         the
         window, and then search for “QuickMapServices” in the search bar. Click on the result
         in
         the menu below the search bar, and then click on “Install Plugin” on the bottom
         right-hand corner of the window.</p>
      <p>
         <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="qgis_1/ScreenShot2020-03-11at12.12.12PM2.png">
            <img alt="" style="max-width:100%;" src="qgis_1/ScreenShot2020-03-11at12.12.12PM2.png" />
            </a>
         </p>
      <p>After the Plugin has installed and you have closed the Plugins window, you should
         then
         notice that there are extra icons in the top menu bar.</p>
      <p>Click on the tiled Earth icon with a plus sign on the bottom right to show the menu
         of
         all available services.</p>
      <p>
         <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="qgis_1/ScreenShot2020-03-11at12.15.10PM2.png">
            <img alt="" style="max-width:100%;" src="qgis_1/ScreenShot2020-03-11at12.15.10PM2.png" />
            </a>
         </p>
      <p>Do you see a “Google” option on the list? If you do not, click on “Settings” on the
         menu,
         and select the “More Services” tab. Ignore the caution message and click on the “Get
         contributed pack”, and Google will then become available together with a long list
         of
         other GIS services.</p>
      <p>Hover over the “Google” option, and then click on the “Google Road” option. This is
         a XYZ
         Tile layer provided by Google, and all of its labels all over the world are in
         English.</p>
      <p>
         <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="qgis_1/ScreenShot2020-03-11at12.18.48PM2.png">
            <img alt="" style="max-width:100%;" src="qgis_1/ScreenShot2020-03-11at12.18.48PM2.png" />
            </a>
         </p>
      <p>You should then notice that there is a layer called “Google Road” in the Layer list
         on
         the lower left-hand side of the main QGIS window.</p>
      <h3 id="adding-the-pokemon-delimited-text-layer">Adding the Pokemon Delimited Text Layer</h3>
      <p>Next, you’ll want to add the Pokemon TSV that you created with XQuery as a delimited
         text
         layer to your QGIS project. To do that, follow the steps outlined for adding a delimited
         text layer in the <a href="https://github.com/ebeshero/DHClass-Hub/blob/master/Assignments/QGIS/qgis_intro.md">QGIS introductory tutorial</a>.</p>
      <p>If you created a TSV file, you’ll need to change a couple of options when you’re
         importing the file. Make sure that you select “Custom Delimiters” and make sure that
         the
         box next to “Tab” is checked. Furthermore, note that the top row of the TSV file you
         created does not have the names of the columns; if your TSV looks like the example
         picture above, then the first row should just contain relevant data. As such, you’ll
         need to ensure that the box next to “First record has field names” is deselected.
         Finally, also if your TSV looks like the example above, the X Field will be “field_4”
         and the Y Field will be “field_3”. If you remember, the Y coordinates are the latitude
         coordinates, while the X coordinates are the longitude coordinates.</p>
      <p>
         <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="qgis_1/ScreenShot2020-03-10at5.05.34PM2.png">
            <img alt="" style="max-width:100%;" src="qgis_1/ScreenShot2020-03-10at5.05.34PM2.png" />
            </a>
         </p>
      <p>Your QGIS map, zoomed out, should now look something like the following image.</p>
      <p>
         <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="qgis_1/ScreenShot2020-03-11at12.29.36PM2.png">
            <img alt="" style="max-width:100%;" src="qgis_1/ScreenShot2020-03-11at12.29.36PM2.png" />
            </a>
         </p>
      <p>Notice that not all of the locations are in Japan: one is in Hawaii. This is because
         some
         of the Pokemon XML files in that collection reference locations that are supposed
         to be
         in Hawaii (and appear to be from the Pokemon Alola world rather than from Kanto);
         it
         does not appear that the original creators of the Pokemon Map Project restricted
         themselves to the Kanto region. However, the map that we want to create will focus
         on
         Japan.</p>
      <p>Note: the picture does include a point in France. That is because it was made working
         with an older version of the collection. It is not correct, and you should not have
         a
         point in France.</p>
      <p>Zoom in on the points clustered in Japan. Your map should look something like the
         image
         below.</p>
      <p>
         <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="qgis_1/ScreenShot2020-03-11at12.33.44PM2.png">
            <img alt="" style="max-width:100%;" src="qgis_1/ScreenShot2020-03-11at12.33.44PM2.png" />
            </a>
         </p>
      <h3 id="changing-point-colors-according-to-type">Changing Point Colors According to Type</h3>
      <p>First, look again at the data in the TSV that makes up the delimited text layer. To
         do
         that, right click on the Pokemon delimited text layer, and then select “Open Attribute
         Table” in the resulting menu.</p>
      <p>
         <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="qgis_1/ScreenShot2020-03-11at12.38.56PM2.png">
            <img alt="" style="max-width:100%;" src="qgis_1/ScreenShot2020-03-11at12.38.56PM2.png" />
            </a>
         </p>
      <p>You can see that there are 21 separate rows for 21 separate locations, but there are
         only
         13 distinct types in this list. We’re going to change the color of the points for
         each
         of these types using “Case” statements.</p>
      <p>
         <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="qgis_1/ScreenShot2020-03-11at12.40.51PM2.png">
            <img alt="" style="max-width:100%;" src="qgis_1/ScreenShot2020-03-11at12.40.51PM2.png" />
            </a>
         </p>
      <p>Close the attribute table window and right click on the Pokemon delimited text layer
         again, this time selecting “Properties” from the resulting menu.</p>
      <p>The “Layer Properties” window should then appear. Select “Symbology” from the menu
         on the
         left-hand side of the window, and then click on the “Simple Marker” symbol from
         underneath “Marker. These are the options that determine what the points currently
         on
         the map look like. You can see that the color that the points are on the map corresponds
         to the color in the box next to “Fill color.” If we wanted to change the color for
         all
         of the points on the map, then we’d change the color in that box. However, we want
         to
         change the colors of all of the points on the map according to the Pokemon types with
         which they are associated, and so we need to create some expressions. To do that,
         click
         on the gray square on the far right hand side of the window, next to the “Fill Color”
         box, and underlined in red in the image below.</p>
      <p>
         <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="qgis_1/ScreenShot2020-03-11at12.59.40PM2.png">
            <img alt="" style="max-width:100%;" src="qgis_1/ScreenShot2020-03-11at12.59.40PM2.png" />
            </a>
         </p>
      <p>Under the “Expression” section of the menu, click on “Edit…” to edit an expression
         that
         governs how the colors of the points should be adjudicated.</p>
      <h4 id="case-statements-in-qgis">Case Statements in QGIS</h4>
      <p>A case statement is like an “If, then” statement, only it’s more convenient to write
         when
         you have numerous conditions that you want to test for.</p>
      <p>With an If, then statement, you want to test to see if a condition returns true. If
         it
         does return true, then you want something to happen.</p>
      <p>An example, in pseudocode: If 3&gt;0, then print “3 is positive”.</p>
      <p>Here, the condition that we want to test is if 3 is greater than 0. It is greater
         than
         zero, and so, if this were a statement in a programming language like Python or Java,
         the statement “3 is positive” would be printed.</p>
      <p>If -4 &gt; 0, then print “-4 is positive” would not print out “-4 is positive”, because
         -4 is not greater than zero.</p>
      <p>A case statement in QGIS works in a similar manner.</p>
      <p>It’s set up like this:</p>
      <p>CASE WHEN condition THEN result WHEN condition THEN result . . . END</p>
      <p>With this, WHEN a condition is true THEN a result shall occur.</p>
      <p>You use CASE and END to bracket all of the accompanying WHEN statements so that QGIS
         is
         able to recognize them for what they are: multiple cases that could be true.</p>
      <h4 id="using-case-statements-to-change-point-colors">Using Case Statements to Change Point Colors</h4>
      <p>After clicking “Edit…”, the Expression String Builder window should open. It should
         look
         something like the image below.</p>
      <p>
         <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="qgis_1/ScreenShot2020-03-11at2.01.43PM2.png">
            <img alt="" style="max-width:100%;" src="qgis_1/ScreenShot2020-03-11at2.01.43PM2.png" />
            </a>
         </p>
      <p>In the blank white space on the left hand side of the window is where you will be
         writing
         the case statement. The middle column, though the white background on my image makes
         it
         very hard to see, contains the different functions that one can use to build an
         expression. Finally, the column on the right contains explanations for each
         function.</p>
      <p>Essentially, we want to use a case statement like this:</p>
      <p>CASE WHEN type = ELECTRIC then color is yellow END</p>
      <p>In other words, the case when the Pokemon type is equal to ‘ELECTRIC’ should result
         in
         the color of the point being yellow.</p>
      <p>What syntax do we need to use to make this happen?</p>
      <p>First, we should remember that the first column, “field_1”, is what stores the Pokemon
         type names. To reference a column, you use double quotes; to represent a string value
         in
         a column, you use single quotes. As such,</p>
      <p>
         <code>WHEN “field_1” = ‘ELECTRIC’ then color is yellow</code>
         </p>
      <p>would be the first part of the WHEN statement that we eventually want to produce.</p>
      <p>Second, to change the color of a point, we use the function <code>rgb(_, _, _)</code>.
         This function uses the rgb value of a color, or the amount of red, green, and blue
         that
         any given color is made of. The first argument of the <code>rgb</code> function contains
         a number from 0-255, which indicates the amount of red that the resulting color should
         have, the second argument also takes a number from 0-255, which indicates the amount
         of
         green that the resulting color should have, and the third argument takes a number
         from
         0-255 that indicates the amount of blue that the resulting color should have.</p>
      <p>If you go to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp" rel="nofollow">HTML Color Picker</a>, you can use the color wheel to choose a color and then find
         out the different ways in which that color can be represented. You can find out the
         rgb
         values for a color using this tool, indicated by the value underlined in red in the
         picture below.</p>
      <p>
         <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="qgis_1/ScreenShot2020-03-11at2.30.41PM2.png">
            <img alt="" style="max-width:100%;" src="qgis_1/ScreenShot2020-03-11at2.30.41PM2.png" />
            </a>
         </p>
      <p>Now we know what the full WHEN statement should look like:</p>
      <p>
         <code>WHEN “field_1” = ‘ELECTRIC’ then rgb(255,255,0)</code>
         </p>
      <p>Use the HTML Color Picker to select colors for each of the different types, and then
         write a CASE statement to change the point color when the value of “field_1” are all
         of
         the different types. You can either type the expression into the window or click on
         the
         different functions in the middle list to compose the expression.</p>
      <p>When you’re finished, click “OK.”</p>
      <p>The main QGIS map should now look something like this, depending on the different
         colors
         that you chose:</p>
      <p>
         <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="qgis_1/ScreenShot2020-03-11at2.46.33PM2.png">
            <img alt="" style="max-width:100%;" src="qgis_1/ScreenShot2020-03-11at2.46.33PM2.png" />
            </a>
         </p>
      <p>You can see that now there are different colors for different Pokemon types. If this
         were
         being developed for a project website, we'd want to prepare a label and a legend to
         associate colors with Pokemon types, but that part is optional for this homework
         assignment.</p>
