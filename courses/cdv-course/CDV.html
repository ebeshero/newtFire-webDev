            <p>Download and install the following software on your own personal computer(s) on or
               before the first day of class. These software tools are available in our campus
               computing labs, too.

                  <a href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_editor.html/">&lt;oXygen/&gt; XML Editor</a>. The University of
                  Pittsburgh has purchased a site license for this software, which is installed in
                  the Pitt computer labs on multiple campuses, and it’s in use in courses here at
                  Greensburg and at Oakland. The license also permits students enrolled in the
                  course to install the software on their home computers (for course-related use
                  only). When installing this on your own computers, <strong>you will need the
                     license key</strong>, which we have posted on our course Announcements section of
                  <a href="https://courseweb.pitt.edu">Courseweb</a>.

                  assignments and projects (also available in the campus computer labs). There are
                  several good options available. We recommend you download and install on your own

                  developing.

            <h2>Coding and Data Visualization: Course Description</h2>
            
            <p>This course is all about doing interesting things with texts using computers and
               digital technology. In this course, you will learn methods for marking, extracting,
               and analyzing data from digital documents to produce visualizations such as graphs,
               charts, diagrams, maps, which you will design in the context of real projects. This
               course is meant to be complementary with the <a href="CDA.html">Coding and Digital Archives course</a>, but where the emphasis in that course is on curating and preparing reading views
               of documents, this course concentrates on analyzing data to produce informational
               graphics. Neither course is meant to be a prerequisite for the other: you may take
               either one as a beginner. Returning students (in either semester) serve as student
               instructor-mentors to beginning students for units and assignments they have already
               completed confidently.
            </p>
            
            <p>Our class is one of the core courses of <a href="http://greensburg.pitt.edu/academics/info/digital-studies">Pitt-Greensburg’s Digital Studies Certificate</a>, and it satisifes a range of
               general education requirements in quantitative reasoning,
               behavioral sciences, and humanities. That is because this course is distinctively
               interdisciplinary in engaging formal and
               quantitative reasoning through computer coding in ways that matter to students in
               humanities and social sciences who are not training to be computer scientists.
               Students gain hands-on experience in this course with applying computer coding to
               represent and investigate cultural materials. As we design projects together, you
               will gain practical experience in editing and you will certainly fine-tune your
               precision in writing and thinking. You will also be learning in an openly collaborative
               environment (as professional coders learn and work) with an emphasis on building sustainable
               and freely accessible resources on the public web.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Students who complete this course will gain skills in digital project management and
               web development, and their digital projects will distinguish them as investigators
               and makers, able to wield computers creatively and effectively for human interests.
               Your success will require patience, dedication, and regular communication and
               interaction with us, working through assignments on a daily basis. Your success will
               <strong>not</strong> require perfection, but rather your regular efforts throughout the course, your
               documenting of problems when your coding doesn’t yield the results you want. Homework
               exercises are a back-and-forth, intensive dialogue between you and your instructors,
               and we plan to spend a great deal of time with you individually over these as we work
               together. Our guiding principle in developing assignments and working with you is
               that the best way for you to learn and succeed is through regular practice as you
               hone your skills. Our goal is not to make you expert programmers (as we are far from
               that ourselves). Instead, we want you to learn how to apply coding technologies for
               your own purposes, how to track down answers to questions, how to think your way
               algorithmically (step-by-step) through problems to find good solutions.
            </p>
            
            
            <h2>Survey of Coding Technologies Covered:</h2>
            
            <p> We work primarily with eXtensible Markup Language (XML) because it is a
               powerful tool for modelling texts that we can adapt creatively to our interests and
               questions. XML represents a standard in adaptability and human-readability in digital
               code, and it works together with related technologies with which you will gain
               working experience: You’ll learn how to write XPath expressions: a formal language
               for searching and extracting information from XML code which serves as the basis for
               transforming XML into many publishable forms. You’ll learn to
               write XSLT: a programming “stylesheet” transforming language designed to convert XML
               to publishable formats. In this course, you will also learn XQuery, an XPath-based
               language designed to query XML as a database, and we will use XQuery to extract information
               and plot it in charts in graphs in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). You will learn
               how to
               design your own systematic coding methods to work on projects, and how to write your
               own rules in schema languages (like Schematron and Relax-NG) to keep your projects
               organized and prevent errors. Since one
               of the best and most widely accessible ways to publish XML is on the worldwide web,
               you’ll gain working experience with HTML code (a markup language that is a kind of
               XML), styling HTML with Cascading Stylesheets (CSS), and adding dynamic features to
               your website with JavaScript.

            <h3>Homework Exercises (35%):</h3>
            
            <p>Regular homework exercises are key to the active learning process in this course.
               Each day will involve some small assignment, building to the larger course
               projects. <strong>Students must complete (on time) at least 90% of each homework component</strong>
               (coding assignments, short response papers, blog postings and responses, in order
               to pass the course. For students who complete the 90% requirement, the homework
               taken all together, is worth 35% of your course grade.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>
               <strong>Coding assignments:</strong> These are assignments you’ll complete by
               writing code to achieve a specified result by applying a coding method you are
               learning. Often, there will be multiple ways of accomplishing the task. You
               will receive lots of feedback from us, in the form of posted results and
               individual commentary on your assignments as needed. If you don’t achieve the
               result you want, you may still receive full credit so long as you have made a
               serious attempt to describe your process, what else you tried, what results you
               expected vs. what results you got, and what you think went wrong. Documenting
               problems is key to the learning process, and sometimes the documentation
               process helps lead you to the solution and always helps your learning
               process. When we post solutions for homework assignments, part of your homework is
               to complete a write-up reviewing what you missed and assessing what you needed to
               do for the correct answer.
            </p>
            
            
            
            <p>
               <strong>Short writing assignments:</strong> We’ll assign short writing assignments in which you will respond to online readings
               or evaluate web projects and resources. These will usually take the form of postings
               on our class GitHub site. Your posting should do more than
               summarize the article or site (which you could just do by skimming or reading
               the first paragraph), but should demonstrate a thoughtful reflection on
               specific ideas and issues. When evaluating a web resource, don’t simply praise
               or condemn it without going into details about why a key component is effective
               or poorly designed. Good posts demonstrate care and reflection, and
               you may choose to respond to the overarching ideas of a piece, or to selected
               details of specific interest.
            </p>
            
            
            
            <p>
               <strong>Project postings:</strong> These will begin on your GitHub sites
               after you have formed teams to work on the course project. As you work on
               course projects in teams, we expect that each team (not each individual
               student) will post a project update, usually by Friday of a given week. These
               postings should be brief status reports about your project work: what you’ve
               accomplished in the preceding week, what problems you’re facing, what you’ve
               been learning, resources you’ve been discussing, and should conclude by
               discussing what you plan to do the following week.
            </p>
            
            
            
            <p>
               <strong>Project responses:</strong> Again, these begin after you have formed
               project teams. All students respond to each other’s projects at least a few times
               during the term. These responses can be brief but for credit
               (and to be useful) they need to be thoughtful: something more than "good work!"
               or "very interesting!" Respond to something specific about the project: make a
               suggestion, offer a critique, ask or answer a question, discuss how something
               in the blog post gave you an idea for your project, share a resource you’ve
               found that may be helpful for the others.
            </p>
            
            
            
            
            <h3>Participation: In Class and on the DH-ClassHub (15%):</h3>
            
            <p> Coding and programming in real life is a social activity, and professionals in
               the real world aren’t "know-it-all" experts who work alone, but rather are tuned
               into discussion boards and regularly ask and answer questions to stay sharp and to
               learn from their community. In this class, we want you to work together and talk
               to each other and your instructors as your community resource, so we have built
               this into our course participation grade as a formal expectation. <strong>Beginning by week two, we’ll expect each student to post at least once per
                  week on our online class discussion board</strong>, and we strongly encourage you
               to do more than this minimum. Ask questions, make suggestions, share helpful
               resources you’ve found. Help each other out by trying to answer questions (and
               read the instructor posts too as we wade in to help). Your instructors will likely
               be dominating the class time as we model concepts and methods, so the discussion
               boards give you all a good space to form into a coding community to help each
               other and reflect together. Also, if you have a question about an assignment, <strong>always think of the discussion board as your first resource</strong> to
               check for helpful hints and to post your questions, because others may have the
               same question and answers are best shared! Of course you may e-mail us, but we
               really prefer you go the discussion board first, and doing so is, after all, worth
               course credit as your participation grade.
            </p>
            
            
            
            <h3>Quizzes and Tests (15%):</h3>
            
            <p>As scheduled throughout the course there will be several (probably about six to
               eight) short quizzes and tests that will take roughly half of the class period
               time. These will ask you to demonstrate your knowledge of coding practices and
               vocabulary learned in an immediately preceding portion of the course. We will drop
               your lowest two scores on these exams. (No make-up exams are given: see course
               policies below.) 
            </p>
            
            
            
            <h3>Project (35%):</h3>
            
            <p> Within the first three weeks of the course, we will familiarize you with some of
               our ongoing projects and their associated research questions. These include the
               <a href="http://pacific.pitt.edu">Digital Archives and Pacific Cultures
                  Site</a>, <a href="http://mitford.pitt.edu">the Digital Mitford
                  Archive</a>, and a site presenting <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~ebb8/EmilyDickinson16/1601.html">manuscript
                  variants in Emily Dickinson’s Fascicle 16</a>. You will be working in teams
               to contribute to these ongoing projects, to develop a site of your own designed to
               enhance these projects or take them in a new direction. The direction you take
               will be partly shaped by you in conversation with the instructors.
               
               Development of the project will involve doing a careful document analysis,
               developing a coding plan and rules to follow, coding your text(s), and developing
               programs to address your research question. It will also involve designing a
               project site to represent your research questions, the texts and your processing
               of them, as well as to share your coding scripts and to reflect on the results of
               your investigation. We will post milestones you must meet for the projects
               throughout the term. Project teams must meet 90% of the project milestone due
               dates in order to receive a passing grade. It is expected that project teams meet
               regularly (each week), check in with the instructors, and delegate tasks to each
               other. Reporting on project progress is required as part of the regular homework
               assignments for the course. Teams are encouraged to meet with us instructors
               during (or outside) our scheduled office hours. In the last few weeks of the
               course, almost all of your course work outside class will be devoted to project
               development, applying the methods you’ve been learning across the semester.

            <h3>Grading Scale:</h3>
            
            <p>Grades are calculated and posted on Courseweb, and follow this standard scale: A:
               93-100%, A-:
               90-92%, B+: 87-89%, B: 83-86%, B-: 80-82%, C+: 77-79%, C: 73-76%, C-: 70-72%, D+:
               67-69%, D: 60-66%, F: 59% and below. In taking the course on a S / NC (pass-fail)
               basis, students must earn a C to receive Satisfactory credit. We give G grades
               (incomplete) at our discretion and only in conformity with the University Registrar
               policy: <a href="http://www.registrar.pitt.edu/grades.html">http://www.registrar.pitt.edu/grades.html</a>.

            <h2>Course Policies:</h2>
            
            <p>Each day we are covering material that builds on earlier material and assignments,
               so
               your success depends upon regular attendance and completing each assignment on
               time.
            </p>
            
            
            <h3>Attendance:</h3>
            
            <p> We strictly require your attendance, as it is not only a setback to yourself but
               to the entire class and the success of our projects if students are repeatedly
               absent. Students must attend at least 90% of our class meetings in order <strong>to pass</strong> the course. Late arrival—particularly a pattern of
               repeated late arrivals—may be counted as absences at our discretion. Attendance
               will be recorded for every class, and each student can earn percentage points
               added towards their total course grade based on the following scale: Zero or one
               absence: +3 pts; Two absences: +2 pts; Three or more: +0 pts. To earn credit, you
               must be present in the classroom by the beginning of class, until class is
               dismissed. For your own sanity, do not miss two consecutive classes. If you are
               experiencing a genuine emergency or crisis, alert us and provide documentation.
               (We do not want you to attend class if you have a fever or flu-like symptoms! If
               you wish to be excused from two or more consecutive class meetings due to your own
               documented illness, please contact one of the following: the Office of the Vice
               President for Academic Affairs, Prof. Jackie Horrall (724-836-7482 or horrall at
               pitt.edu), our Campus Health Center (Nurse Patty or Pamela Reed, 724-836-9947 or
               upgdoc at pitt.edu), or the Director of Counseling, Gayle Pamerleau (gaylep at
               pitt.edu), who can then officially alert all of your professors.
            </p>
            
            
            
            <h3>Deadlines:</h3>
            
            <p> Your daily homework for this course is time-sensitive! Coding assignments,
               response papers, and other homework exercises must be uploaded to CourseWeb (or to
               Box, or the Sandbox server as specified), by the date and time indicated by the
               instructors. Homework assignments will be posted online to our class DHDS website
               and linked from our schedule, so students who miss class are nevertheless expected
               to consult the schedule and submit assignments on time. Because we post and share
               answers to homework exercises after submission deadlines, we will not accept late
               homework submissions. In order to pass the course, students must submit at least
               90% of the regular homework assignments, and complete at least 90% of the work in
               each component of the course.
            </p>
            
            
            
            <h3>Exam Policy:</h3>
            
            <p> Similarly, because we will be posting answers or sharing them in class, we do not
               give make-up examinations. However, we will drop your lowest two exam scores for
               the class, so that you may miss up to two exams without penalty.
            </p>
            
            
            
            <h3>Classroom Courtesy:</h3>
            
            <p>Our class is fast paced, and requires that we all be making the best use we can of
               our in-person class sessions. Arriving late and leaving early disrupts the
               important collective mental activity of class. So does in-class texting and
               checking your cell phone. While class is in progress, talking disruptively,
               leaving the classroom, texting or using a cell phone or computer, reading a
               newspaper, or other distracting behavior will be actively discouraged, and may
               result in a deduction in your Participation grade. Please respect what we do in
               the classroom: attend class regularly, and come prepared to contribute your
               questions and ideas.
            </p>
            
            
            
            <h3>E-mail:</h3>
            
            <p>Each student is issued a University email address (username@pitt.edu) upon
               admission. This email address may be used by the University for official
               communication with students. Students are expected to read email sent to this
               account on a regular basis. Failure to read and react to University communications
               in a timely manner does not absolve the student from knowing and complying with
               the content of the communications. The University provides an email forwarding
               service that allows students to read their email via other service providers
               (e.g., Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo). Students who choose to forward their email from their
               pitt.edu address to another address do so at their own risk. If email is lost as a
               result of forwarding, it does not absolve the student from responding to official
               communications sent to their University email address. To forward email sent to
               your University account, go to http://accounts.pitt.edu, log into your account,
               click on Edit Forwarding Addresses, and follow the instructions on the page. Be
               sure to log out of your account when you have finished. (For the full Email
               Communication Policy, go to <a href="http://www.bc.pitt.edu/policies/policy/09/09-10-01.html">http://www.bc.pitt.edu/policies/policy/09/09-10-01.html</a>.)

            <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
            
            <p>
               <strong>Source Citation and Plagiarism:</strong> One goal of our course is to
               reflect on how best to cite sources in digital contexts. We will consider how and
               why such citations differ from documenting printed texts. We will also consider
               the ease and frequency with which digital texts and graphics are plagiarized on
               the worldwide web, and discuss how the omission of source citations detracts from
               the authority of a digital information resource. We expect you to practice mindful
               source citation, and plagiarism on your part will have very serious
               consequences.
            </p>
            
            <p>Plagiarism falsely represents another source’s words or ideas as your own, and, if
               you commit plagiarism in this course, you will receive a final course grade of F
               and be reported to the Vice President of Academic Affairs. Representing the voice
               of another individual as your own voice constitutes plagiarism, however generous
               that person may be in “helping” you with an assignment. Turning in an assignment
               generated collectively under the name of a single individual is considered
               plagiarism. <strong>When instructed to collaborate on a project, project
                  collaborators share collective authorship and should identify themselves
                  directly as a team.</strong> To avoid plagiarism, cite your sources whenever you
               quote, paraphrase, or summarize material, or use digital images from any outside
               source (including websites, articles, books, course readings, Courseweb postings,
               or someone else’s notes). When using the “copy” and “paste” features as you read
               and research, be sure that you are carefully marking that these passages are
               unprocessed from their source, so that you know to process it later. Forgetting to
               do so not only produces sloppy work but (whether you intended it or not) results
               in a false representation. As long as you make a good faith and clear effort to
               cite your sources, you will not be faulted for plagiarism, but your work will be
               penalized if citations are inaccurate, unclear, or lack important information.
               Cheating on exams or exercises will also receive a final course grade of F and
               will be reported to the Vice President of Academic Affairs.
