            <h2>All the Tools You Need As We Begin:</h2>
            
            
            <p>Download and install the following software on your own personal computer(s) on or
               before the first day of class. These software tools are available in our campus
               computing labs, too.
            </p>

                  <strong>All students:</strong>
                  <a href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_editor.html/">&lt;oXygen/&gt; XML Editor</a>. The University of
                  Pittsburgh has purchased a site license for this software, which is installed in
                  the Pitt computer labs on multiple campuses, and it’s in use in courses here at
                  Greensburg and at Oakland. The license also permits students enrolled in the
                  course to install the software on their home computers (for course-related use
                  only). When installing this on your own computers, <strong>you will need the
                     license key</strong>, which we have posted on our course Announcements section of
                  <a href="https://courseweb.pitt.edu">Courseweb</a>.
               </li>
               
               <li>All students require a good means of secure file transfer (SFTP) for homework
                  assignments and projects (also available in the campus computer labs). There are
                  several good options available. We recommend you download and install on your own
                  computers one (or more) of the following, depending on your platform: (Feel free
                  to experiment with these and others!)

               <li>This course fulfills general education requirements in Q2, NS, SS, and HM, and
                  it fulfills a core requirement for <a href="http://greensburg.pitt.edu/academics/info/digital-studies">the Digital
                     Studies Certificate at Pitt-Greensburg</a>. Think about where this course
                  might fit in your academic career, and how you might apply the skills you learn
                  here.

               <li>No coding experience? Don’t worry! You are in very good company. We don’t
                  expect any of you to have written a line of computer code before now. Past
                  students in this course who never saw anything like markup or XML code have
                  designed projects (<a href="http://newtfire.org/dh/studentProjects.html">like
                     these</a>) and even spoken about them at an undergraduate conference! You’ll
                  help continue some of these projects we’ve started, and you’ll learn to build and
                  create digital tools for yourself with skills we hope you will keep
                  developing.

                     <p><strong>GitHub Practice (starting today for seven days):</strong> Make sure your personal repo is properly set up and cloned to your local computer.
                        Using your Git Bash Shell, practice some basic Git commands to build a habit: Always
                        pull before you push! Then push one file per day either to your personal repo or the
                        DHClass-Hub. On alternating days, push to the other repo (if you pushed to your personal
                        repo today, tomorrow you will push to the DHClass-Hub). Try cloning repos on multiple
                        computers that you may be using through the semester (including computer lab machines
                        on campus). Pull up our quick guide <a href="https://github.com/ebeshero/DHClass-Hub/blob/master/Git_BasicCommands.md">Using Git Through Command Line</a> for a ready reference of commands and look up details in our <a href="explainGitShell.html">Guide to Git Shell</a>.

                     <p><strong>UX Discussion on DHClass-Hub</strong> Choose one of the following digital archives to explore, find the appropriate discussion
                        thread on the DHClass-Hub, and write a post discussing: 1) how visual aids are used
                        to convey information on the site, and how well (or badly) do these work? What seems
                        unclear to you, and/or what seems to work really well? 2) how effective is the (“UX”)
                        in navigating at least one or two significant areas of the site? (Respond to each
                        other as the thread develops.)

                                 ideas for team projects to work on this semester. Each student
                                 should post an idea for the class to consider: a project involving
                                 XML markup to be managed within a team of 2-4 students to
                                 investigate something we could study and visualize from our markup
                                 more effectively with computers than with human reading and
                                 description alone. All projects must involve a team of at least two
                                 persons, but this first exploratory proposal is an individual
                                 assignment.
