        <h1>QGIS Exercise 2</h1>
        <p>For this assignment, you’ll work with data from the <a
                href="http://pacific.obdurodon.org/index.html" rel="nofollow">Digital Archives and
                Pacific Cultures</a> Project and the <a href="http://magellan.newtfire.org"
                rel="nofollow">Ferdinand Magellan</a> Project to create a map that examines how
            historical navigators travelled around weather conditions and how similar two historic
            voyages were to each other.</p>
        <p>The Digital Archives and Pacific Cultures Project examined the travel logs from
            historical navigators and encoded those logs in TEI XML. For this assignment, we’ll be
            looking at the voyages of Captain Cook and Georg Forster, both of whom travelled the
            Pacific in the 1700s.</p>
        <p>The Ferdinand Magellan Project examines the voyage of Spanish explorer Ferdinand
            Magellan, who set sail in 1519 to discover a Western sea route to the Spice Islands and
            became the first European to cross the Pacific Ocean in the process. This project
            encoded Magellan’s logs for this ground-breaking voyage.</p>
        <p>All of these seafarers were affected by the weather patterns in the ocean they travelled,
            and so, with this assignment, you’ll look at where the points the voyagers described in
            their logs stack up next to global oceanic weather patterns, sea surface temperature and
            wind speed. Furthermore, you’ll look how the points described in logs by the later
            voyagers Cook and Forster compare to points described in logs by Magellan and see how
            spatially similar the voyages were to each other with nearest-neighbor analysis.</p>
        <p>Could weather have impacted the routes of Cook, Forster, or Magellan, and would that
            result in them have described similar locations in their logs?</p>

        <h3 id="historical-geodata">Historical Geodata</h3>
        <p>Projects looking at historical subjects often have the added challenge of needing to work
            with historical data, which can sometimes be messy. Furthermore, sometimes data is
            missing or incomplete. As such, sometimes it can be challenging to merely find relevant
            historical data, let alone relevant historical geodata.</p>
        <p>Note: A good starting point for finding historical geodata is <a

        <h3 id="sea-surface-temperature-raster-layer">Sea Surface Temperature Raster Layer</h3>
        <p>First, download the Network Common Data Form (NetCDF) file of global sea surface
            temperatures from 1850-2020, created by the Hadley Centre in conjunction with the
            Climatic Research Unit of the University of East Anglia.</p>
        <p>Sea surface temperature file: <a
                href="https://github.com/ebeshero/DHClass-Hub/raw/master/Assignments/QGIS/qgis_2/absolute.nc"
                >absolute.nc</a></p>
        <p>Save it to your local machine in a place that you will remember.</p>
        <p>This file is a raster file, which means that it’s made up of matrices of discrete cells
            that represent features on, above, or below the earth’s surface. These cells are
            rectangular and uniform.</p>
        <p>To import the .nc file into QGIS, go to Layers &gt; Add Layer &gt; Add Raster Layer. Once
            there, click on the three dots next to “Raster Database(s)” to navigate to your file.
            Then, click “Add.”</p>

        <p>Next, a window asking for you to choose a CRS (coordinate reference system) may appear.

        <p>A layer called “absolute” should appear in the project, and it should look like the
            following image.</p>
        <p>
            <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                href="/ebeshero/DHClass-Hub/blob/master/Assignments/QGIS/qgis_2/ScreenShot2020-03-21at8.59.42PM.png">
                <img
                    src="/ebeshero/DHClass-Hub/raw/master/Assignments/QGIS/qgis_2/ScreenShot2020-03-21at8.59.42PM.png"

            </a>
        </p>
        <p>As you can see, this layer looks pixelated because it is made up of many cells,
            rectangles, of data. The darker blue and black areas are where the ocean is colder,
            while the lighter areas, closer to the equator, represent warmer ocean surface
            temperatures.</p>
        <p>Since this is a raster layer of the ocean, it’s kind of hard to see where the continents
            are. Next, add the OpenStreetMap XYZ Tile layer, as you did in the Intro Tutorial. Make
            sure that it is above the “absolute” layer in the Layers menu; the “absolute” layer
            should disappear from view.</p>
        <p>We’re going to alter the transparency of the “OpenStreetMap” layer so that we can see the
            “absolute” layer through it. After all, we don’t want to completely erase the sea
            surface temperature data; we just want to be able to more easily contextualize the
            information presented there.</p>
        <p>Right click on the “OpenStreetMap” layer in the “Layers” menu and select “Properties…”
            from the resulting menu. On the menu on the left-hand side, select “Transparency.”</p>
        <p>In the “Transparency” tab, we want to lessen the Global Opacity so that the layer becomes
            more transparent and we can see the “absolute” layer through the “OpenStreetMap” layer.
            You can click and drag the sliding bar underneath “Global Opacity” or type in an opacity
            into the text box beside the sliding bar to alter the opacity. I found that an opacity
            around 35% worked well, but you should test out some different opacities to find one
            that works. Click “Ok” when finished to return to the map.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Now, the continents are now more visible on the map, and we can more easily contextualize
            the ocean surface temperature information.</p>
        <h3 id="wind-speed-vector-layer">Wind Speed Vector Layer</h3>
        <p>Now, we’ll work with wind speed data from the Global Forecast System (GFS) of the US
            National Weather Service.</p>
        <p>Download the following .csv file and save it to your machine. It was acquired from the
            ERDDAP server hosted by the Pacific Islands Ocean Observing System.</p>
        <p>
            <a
                href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ebeshero/DHClass-Hub/master/Assignments/QGIS/qgis_2/wind_vectors.csv"
                rel="nofollow">wind_vectors.csv</a>
        </p>
        <h4 id="prepping-the-data">Prepping the Data</h4>
        <p>The data in this file has already been cleaned and corrected; however, as it is, it is
            incomplete.</p>
        <p>You should open the file in a spreadsheet editing program, such as Microsoft Excel or
            LibreOffice. Notice that there are five columns: id, latitude, longitude, u component,
            and v component. As you're opening the document, you may be asked to specify the comma
            as the delimiter in the document. You should enter through this to open a CSV in an
            Excel environment.</p>
        <p>The id column is a unique identifier for each row. We’ll use that later. The latitude and
            longitude columns are pretty self-explanatory, because they hold the geocoordinates for
            the wind vectors. The u component and the v component columns hold the u-component and
            v-component of the wind vectors, respectively.</p>
        <h5 id="a-short-math-lesson-calculating-wind-direction-and-speed">A Short Math Lesson: Calculating Wind Direction and Speed</h5>
        <p>A vector is a direction with magnitude. It’s, graphically, an arrow pointing in a certain
            direction with a certain size, or length. Because we often want to graph vectors on the
            Cartesian plane, we talk of vectors as having x-components, also sometimes called
            i-components, and y-components, or j-components. A vector’s x-component is the number of
            units it stretches horizontally, and a vector’s y-component is the number of units it
            stretches vertically.</p>
        <p>So if you look at the following image, you can identify the red and blue lines as
            vectors, and you can see that the red one has been named u and the blue one v. They have
            different directions and different sizes, magnitude. Consider vector v. It starts at
            point R, (0,0), and ends at point S, (3,4). The x-component of vector v would be 3,
            because it stretches out 3 units in the x-direction. The y-component would be 4, because
            it stretches up 4 units in the y-direction. Vector u, alternatively, moves two units to
            the left and two units up. As such, it has an x-component of -2 (because it’s moving
            along the negative x-axis, or to the left) and a y-component of 2.</p>

        <p>If you imagine a right triangle like the one below, the y-component would be like the

            horizontal, right-and-left leg of the triangle.</p>

        <p>For some reason, meteorologists decided to call the x-component of a vector its
            u-component and the y-component its v-component. With wind vectors, you say that a
            vector moving to the right has a positive u wind from the west, and a vector moving up
            has a positive v wind from the south. If a vector was moving down and to the left, you’d
            say that it has a negative u wind from the east and negative v wind from the north. You
            can kind of see that in the image below, which describes a vector with u and
            v-components. Just ignore the circle with a line through it and the equations for u and
            v, for now.</p>
        <p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"

                >http://colaweb.gmu.edu/dev/clim301/lectures/wind/wind-uv</a></p>
        <p>In short, the columns “u component” and “v component” hold the u and v components of each
            of the wind vectors, or how much they move in the x- and y- directions,
            respectively.</p>
        <p>Hopefully you haven’t been scared off, yet.</p>
        <p>So we’ve got the u- and v-components of the vectors, now we’ve got to get the vectors
            themselves. If you remember the right triangle from above, we’ve got the horizontal and
            vertical legs of the triangle, and now we want to get the diagonal leg, the hypotenuse,
            that connects the horizontal and vertical legs.</p>
        <p>What’s a vector, again? It’s a direction with magnitude. As such, we need to use the u-
            and v-components to find the <strong>direction</strong> of the vector and its
                <strong>magnitude</strong>.</p>
        <p>The direction of the vector is its angle up or down from straight zero degrees. We
            usually name that angle “theta,” which is designated with \theta. It’s the circle with a
            line through it. It will always be less than 180 degrees, because it’s part of a
            triangle.</p>
        <p>Okay, now go <em>way</em> back to trigonometry.</p>
        <p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"

            dummies</a></p>
        <p>I’m not going to hold forth on this because this isn’t a math class, but maybe you’ll
            remember that to find the theta, as pictured in the image above, you’ll need to take the
            inverse of the tangent function, or the cotangent. The adjacent leg is the x- or
            u-component and the opposite leg is the y- or v-component.</p>
        <p>So what do we need to do? Take the u-component and divide it by the v-component. Or let
            the spreadsheet editor do it for us with a formula. This will give us the value of the
            angle, or the direction of the wind vector.</p>
        <p>Your spreadsheet editor should have a function called Atan2(), which takes in 2
            arguments: the u-component and the y-component of the vector.</p>
        <p>Atan2(v-component, u-component) = \theta</p>
        <p>To utilize a function in a spreadsheet editor, go to a blank column, type in “=“ and then
            your function, referencing the names of the cells (column letter and row number) that
            you want to use for the calculation.</p>

            that, you SHOULD get #Value as the result--because it's trying to use words - the labels
            - to do a mathematical calculation. Just ignore it for now.</p>
        <p>Highlight the entire column by clicking on the column letter. Then, hit CTRL+D (or

        <p>Now, we need to get the vectors’ magnitudes. In other words, we need to find the
            hypotenuse of the triangle.</p>
        <p>If you go WAY back, you may recall something called Pythagorean’s Theorem.</p>
        <p><code>a^2+b^2=c^2</code>, with “a” and “b” the opposite and adjacent legs of the right
            triangle and “c” the hypotenuse.</p>
        <p>Or,</p>
        <p>
            <code>c = √a^2 + b^2</code>
        </p>
        <p>In words: the hypotenuse is equal to the square root of the value of one leg multiplied

        <p>This is a map of the various wind speeds around the globe, with, in my image, the orange
            color representing areas with high wind speeds and light blue areas representing areas
            with low wind speeds.</p>
        <p>However, we’ve lost our sea surface temperature data and the OpenStreetMap layer! Go back
            to the Properties of the wind vector layer and return to the Symbology tab.</p>
        <p>At the bottom of the window unhide the “Layer Rendering” section, then use the sliding
            bar next to “Opacity” to alter the transparency of the layer. I found that an opacity
            around 20% works in order to see the sea surface temperature information through the

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Import “magellan.csv” as a delimited-text layer into QGIS, just as you’ve done before.
            The second column will be the X coordinate and the third will be the Y coordinate.</p>
        <p>Import “pacific.csv” as a delimited-text layer into QGIS as well, being sure to check the
            box next to “DMS Coordinates.” The latitude and longitude coordinates in “Degree Minute
            Second”, or DMS, format. Checking the box allows QGIS to account for that. The third
            column will be the X coordinate and the second will be the Y coordinate.</p>
        <p>Finally, import “magellan_desc.csv” into QGIS as a delimited-text layer. This file, if
            you open it, has no latitude or longitude coordinates. It contains merely a column
            containing a unique identifier for each row and then place names (sometimes those are
            written as latitude or longitude coordinates, but we’re counting them as names, here,
            because that’s what they were encoded as in the original project data.) Because of this,
            be sure to select “No geometry (attribute only table)” in the “Geometry Definition”
            section.</p>
        <p>The map should now look something like the following. On my map, the pink dots are the
            Pacific Project data points, and the blue points are the Magellan data points. There is
            no apparent “magellan_desc” layer visible on the map because that layer does not contain
            geocoordinates of any sort.</p>

        <p>What the “magellan_desc” layer DOES contain are labels for each of the Magellan data
            points. However, before we can label the Magellan points with the labels contained in
            the “magellan_desc” layer, we need to join the “magellan_desc” layer to the “magellan”
            layer.</p>
        <p>Right click on the “magellan” layer and click on “Properties…” Go to the “Labels” tab and
            click on the menu that currently has “No Labels” selected. Then, select “Single Label”
            from the resulting menu. If you click on the drop-down menu next to “Label with,” you’ll
            see that the only options are fields 1, 2, or 3, none of which contain meaningful labels
            for the Magellan data points. Field 1 contains IDs, field 2 contains latitude points,
            and field 3 contains longitude points. The names of the data points are contained in the
            “magellan_desc” layer, so we need to join the two layers together.</p>
        <p>Go to the “Joins” tab and click on the green plus sign on the bottom left-hand side of
            the window.</p>

        <p>What does it mean to join two layers together? It means that you find a common value that
            connects each row of one layer to each row of the other. In this case, the IDs for the
            latitude and longitude points in the “magellan.csv” file are the same as the IDs for the
            place names in the “magellan_desc.csv” file. As such, we’ll use the ID column in both of
            the tables, layers, to join them together.</p>
        <p>Essentially, we’re saying that that the data contained in the columns of the
            “magellan_desc.csv” file is connected to the data contained in the columns of the
            “magellan.csv” file because they share the same ID.</p>
        <p>In the “Add Vector Join” window, select “magellan_desc” as the “Join Layer”. The “Join
            Field” should be “id” - the name of the column of IDs in the “magellan_desc.csv” file.
            The “Target Field” should be “field_1”, the column of IDs in the “magellan.csv” file.
            Then click “Ok.”</p>

            actually be mapped because they are incomplete, and they will be harmful for the

            To do this, we’ll first construct a distance matrix.</p>
        <p>A distance matrix will take points on the map and then calculate the distance between
            them. Actually, it will be calculating the magnitude of the vector between the two
            points - a calculation you know how to do - but that is perhaps beside the point.</p>
        <p>Unhide the “Vector analysis” section of the “Processing Toolbox,” then scroll down and
            double-click “Distance Matrix.”</p>
        <p>In the Distance Matrix window, select “magellan” as the “Input point layer,” “field_1” as
            the “Input unique ID field,” “pacific” as the “Target point layer,” and “field_1” as the
            “Target unique ID field.” Then, ensure that the output matrix type is a Linear (N*k x 3)
            distance matrix, and that 1 is in the box beneath “Use only the nearest (k) target
            points,” which means that only the nearest neighbor will be produced in the output.
            Click “Run,” when finished, and then wait for the process to finish before closing the
            window.</p>

        <p>That created a new layer called “Distance matrix,” and it should be now represented by
            points on the map. If you were to open the attribute table of this new layer, you’d
            notice that there’s columns for the input layer’s ID, the target layer’s ID, and the
            distance between those two points.</p>
        <p>Now, we want to change the styling of the “Distance matrix” layer so that it’s a little
            bit more intuitive that it’s representing a distance. Right click on the layer and click
            on “Properties…”</p>
        <p>Go to the Symbology tab. Click on “Simple marker,” beneath “Marker.” Then, click on the
            “Symbol layer type” menu and select “Geometry generator.”</p>

        <p>Then, change the “Geometry type” to “Line/Multiline String.”</p>
        <p>In the expression window, type <code>make_line(point_n( $geometry, 1), point_n(
                $geometry, 2))</code></p>
        <p>This basically says to draw a line between points. In our case, lines will be drawn
            between the Magellan points and the Pacific points that are nearest to those points.</p>

        <p>You can see that the Magellan points are closest to Pacific Project points most often in
            areas of high wind speed and high surface water temperature - areas where storms are
            likely to occur.</p>
        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Of course, more data, especially more Magellan data, would make this graph more
            interesting. However, I think it is apparent that weather may possibly have affected the
            Cook and Forster voyages, because you can see that those points are clustered in areas
            of high wind speed and low sea surface temperature.</p>
        <p>Use Map Layout to create a nice picture of your map, complete with features like a title
            or legend that make your map more easily understood by others. NOTE: We found that if we
            exported the map to SVG this time the file size was enormous, and it was better to
            export an image and choose .PNG as the file type for a more portable graphic.</p>
