         <!--ebb: Need to rewrite XSLT to calculate dates from start to end of term. Non XSLT solution: To begin for a new year, autogenerate a list of dates and days of week in Excel (start with manually entering the first week’s dates, and add +7 to each; format as ISO dates. 
            Paste in template xml file and autotag weeks as tables and days as rows, with cells for date, class activity, and assignments. 
            Then manually correct with holidays and Fall Break, etc.-->

            <head>Coding and Data Visualization: Course Description</head>
            <p>This course is all about doing interesting things with texts using computers and
                digital technology. In this course, you will learn methods for marking, extracting, and analyzing data from digital documents to produce visualizations such as graphs, charts, diagrams, maps, which you will design in the context of real projects. This course is meant to be complementary with the <ref target="CDA.html">Coding and Digital Archives course</ref>, but where the emphasis in that course is on curating and preparing reading views of documents, this course concentrates on analyzing data to produce informational graphics. Neither course is meant to be a prerequisite for the other: you may take either one as a beginner. Returning students (in either semester) serve as student instructor-mentors to beginning students for units and assignments they have already completed confidently.</p>
             <p>Our class is one of the core courses of <ref target="https://www.greensburg.pitt.edu/academics/majors-minors/digital-studies">Pitt-Greensburg’s Digital Studies Certificate</ref>, and it satisifes a range of
                 general education requirements in quantitative reasoning,
                 behavioral sciences, and humanities. That is because this course is distinctively
                 interdisciplinary in engaging formal and
                 quantitative reasoning through computer coding in ways that matter to students in
                 humanities and social sciences who are not training to be computer scientists.
                 Students gain hands-on experience in this course with applying computer coding to
                 represent and investigate cultural materials. As we design projects together, you
                 will gain practical experience in editing and you will certainly fine-tune your
                 precision in writing and thinking. You will also be learning in an openly collaborative environment (as professional coders learn and work) with an emphasis on building sustainable and freely accessible resources on the public web.</p>
             
             <p>Students who complete this course will gain skills in practical hands-on programming, digital project management, and
                 web development. Their digital projects will distinguish them as investigators
                 and makers, able to wield computers creatively and effectively for human interests.
                 Your success will require patience, dedication, and regular communication and
                 interaction with us, working through assignments on a daily basis. Your success will
                 <hi>not</hi> require perfection, but rather your regular efforts throughout the course and your
                 documenting of problems when your coding doesn’t yield the results you want. Homework
                 exercises are a back-and-forth, intensive dialogue between you and your instructors,
                 and we plan to spend a great deal of time with you individually over these as we work
                 together. Our guiding principle in developing assignments and working with you is
                 that the best way for you to learn and succeed is through regular practice as you
                 hone your skills. Our goal is not to make you expert programmers (as we are far from
                 that ourselves). Instead, we want you to learn how to apply coding technologies for
                 your own purposes, how to track down answers to questions, how to think your way
                 algorithmically (step-by-step) through problems to find good solutions.</p>
         
         </div>
          <div type="description" style="main"><head>Survey of Coding Technologies Covered:</head>
              <p> We work primarily with eXtensible Markup Language (XML) because it is a
                  powerful tool for modelling texts that we can adapt creatively to our interests and questions. XML represents a standard in adaptability and human-readability in digital code, and it works together with related technologies with which you will gain
                  working experience: You’ll learn how to write XPath expressions: a formal language for searching and extracting information from XML code which serves as the basis for
                  transforming XML into many publishable forms. You’ll learn to
                  write XSLT: a programming “stylesheet” transforming language designed to convert XML
                  to publishable formats. In this course, you will also learn XQuery, an XPath-based language designed to query XML as a database, and we will use XQuery to extract information and plot it in charts in graphs in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). You will learn how to
                  design your own systematic coding methods to work on projects, and how to write your
                  own rules in schema languages (like Schematron and Relax-NG) to keep your projects
                  organized and prevent errors. Since one
                  of the best and most widely accessible ways to publish XML is on the worldwide web,
                  you’ll gain working experience with HTML code (a markup language that is a kind of
                  XML), styling HTML with Cascading Stylesheets (CSS), and adding dynamic features to your website with JavaScript.</p>

                         <hi rend="em">Coding assignments:</hi> Coding exercises in this course are about your active learning, and not—as in other courses—a way of testing whether you have already learned something we covered in class or in an assigned reading. You may often need to look up how to do something that you don’t already know how to do. Often, there will be multiple ways of accomplishing the task and we are not simply looking for you to do things perfectly in just one way. We are instead looking for a record of your learning process as you take on a challenge. Documenting problems is key to learning, and sometimes just writing out what you are trying to do helps lead you to a solution! When we post solutions for homework assignments, part of your homework may be to write a comment to review what you missed and assessing what you needed to do for the correct answer. There may be times when you don’t get the result you want in the homework, and that is to be expected! In those cases you can still get full credit for the assignment if you’ve made a serious attempt and if you submit, along with your code, a description of what else you tried, what results you expected, what results you got, and what you think went wrong. Getting stuck is part of the learning process and the instructors will be happy to help unstick you as long as you’ve described your understanding of the problem and your attempts to resolve it on your own.</p>
                     <p>The instructors will read and evaluate all student homework, and will post an assessment in the Canvas Grade Center. Coding assignments are assessed as <q>check plus</q>, <q>check</q>, and <q>check minus</q>, or <q>redo</q>. Don’t think of these as grades, since they all receive full credit; they are feedback, for learning purposes, about how well you engaged with the assignment. If you have not engaged with the assignment adequately (whether that means solving the tasks or discussing the coding obstacles you encountered and how you dealt with them), we will ask you to meet with us to review the issues and then complete a followup (redo) task in order to receive credit. For assignments with posted solutions, we invite you to review the posted solution on GitHub and comment on it (we will show you how to do this) to address something you learned from the solution or did in a different way. For some assignments where we review posted solutions and line-comments together in person or in class, we will write back to you with individual comments only if your specific submission raises an issue that we don’t address elsewhere. If we don’t return your assignment, that means that we have nothing to add to our posted solution, but should you have any specific questions after you’ve read our posted solution, please ask the instructors. </p>

                 <p> Coding and programming in real life is a social activity, and professionals in
                     the real world aren’t “know-it-all” experts who work alone, but rather are tuned
                     into discussion boards and regularly ask and answer questions to stay sharp and to
                     learn from their community. In this class, we want you to work together and talk
                     to each other and your instructors as your community resource, so we have built
                     this into our course participation grade as a formal expectation. <hi>Beginning by week two, we’ll expect each student to post at least once per
                         week on <ref target="https://github.com/ebeshero/DHClass-Hub/issues">our course GitHub repo</ref></hi>, and we strongly encourage you
                     to do more than this minimum. Earn an <q>A</q> in participation by asking questions, making suggestions, and sharing helpful
                     resources you’ve found. Help each other out by trying to answer questions on GitHub (and
                     read the instructor posts too as we wade in to help). Your instructors will likely
                     be dominating the class time as we model concepts and methods, so the GitHub Issues board gives the students a good space to form into a coding community to help each
                     other and reflect together. Also, if you have a question about an assignment, <hi rend="em">always think of our GitHub Issues board as your first resource</hi> to
                     check for helpful hints and to post your questions, because others may have the
                     same question and answers are best shared! Of course you may e-mail us, but we
                     really prefer you go the discussion board first, and doing so is, after all, worth
                     course credit as your participation grade.</p>

All but the first test will be take-home and assigned over a weekend. They are open-book, open notes, but they must be completed individually and are designed to demonstrate that you have learned from the class material, coding assignments, and posted solutions.  Tests may resemble homework assignments, but unlike homework exercises, these are given letter grades. These are given grades because they are evaluative and involve demonstrating what you have learned after we have finished a coding unit.</p>

                 <p>Throughout the semester you will be working as part of a team on a course project. Early in the semester each student posts a proposal for a semester project to work with a text (or collection of texts) in the public domain and a set of research questions to explore in a coding project. Teams will form around a selection of these projects in mid-September and begin work, performing document analysis, developing and implementing a system of markup and project rules, marking up text following that system, writing programs to conduct research and create a resource to share on a public website you will develop together that represents your investigation and your conclusions. Each project team must meet regularly together and with a project mentor (one of the instructor team) outside of class for project planning and discussion. Each of the project components described below adds up to 40% of your grade for the course.</p>

               <p>Our class is fast paced, and requires that we all be making the best use we can of
                  our in-person class sessions. Arriving late and leaving early disrupts the
                  important collective mental activity of class. So does in-class texting and
                  checking your cell phone. While class is in progress, talking disruptively,
                  leaving the classroom, texting or using a cell phone or computer, reading a
                  newspaper, or other distracting behavior will be actively discouraged, and may
                  result in a deduction in your Participation grade. Please respect what we do in
                  the classroom: attend class regularly, and come prepared to contribute your
                  questions and ideas.</p>

               <head>E-mail:</head>
               <p>Each student is issued a University email address (username@pitt.edu) upon
                  admission. This email address may be used by the University for official
                  communication with students. Students are expected to read email sent to this
                  account on a regular basis. Failure to read and react to University communications
                  in a timely manner does not absolve the student from knowing and complying with
                  the content of the communications. The University provides an email forwarding
                  service that allows students to read their email via other service providers
                  (e.g., Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo). Students who choose to forward their email from their
                  pitt.edu address to another address do so at their own risk. If email is lost as a
                  result of forwarding, it does not absolve the student from responding to official
                  communications sent to their University email address. To forward email sent to
                  your University account, go to http://accounts.pitt.edu, log into your account,
                  click on Edit Forwarding Addresses, and follow the instructions on the page. Be
                  sure to log out of your account when you have finished. (For the full Email

                  <hi rend="em">Source Citation and Plagiarism:</hi> One goal of our course is to
                  reflect on how best to cite sources in digital contexts. We will consider how and
                  why such citations differ from documenting printed texts. We will also consider
                  the ease and frequency with which digital texts and graphics are plagiarized on
                  the worldwide web, and discuss how the omission of source citations detracts from
                  the authority of a digital information resource. We expect you to practice mindful
                  source citation, and plagiarism on your part will have very serious
                  consequences.</p>
               <p>Plagiarism falsely represents another source’s words or ideas as your own, and, if
                  you commit plagiarism in this course, you will receive a final course grade of F
                  and be reported to the Vice President of Academic Affairs. Representing the voice
                  of another individual as your own voice constitutes plagiarism, however generous
                  that person may be in “helping” you with an assignment. Turning in an assignment
                  generated collectively under the name of a single individual is considered
                  plagiarism. <hi rend="em">When instructed to collaborate on a project, project
                     collaborators share collective authorship and should identify themselves
                     directly as a team.</hi> To avoid plagiarism, cite your sources whenever you
                  quote, paraphrase, or summarize material, or use digital images from any outside
                  source (including websites, articles, books, course readings, Canvas postings,
                  or someone else’s notes). When using the “copy” and “paste” features as you read
                  and research, be sure that you are carefully marking that these passages are
                  unprocessed from their source, so that you know to process it later. Forgetting to
                  do so not only produces sloppy work but (whether you intended it or not) results
                  in a false representation. As long as you make a good faith and clear effort to
                  cite your sources, you will not be faulted for plagiarism, but your work will be
                  penalized if citations are inaccurate, unclear, or lack important information.
                  Cheating on exams or exercises will also receive a final course grade of F and
                  will be reported to the Vice President of Academic Affairs.</p>

                            persons, but this first exploratory proposal is an individual
