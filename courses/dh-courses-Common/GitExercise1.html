            <h3>Preliminaries</h3>
            <p>Before beginning this assignment please thoroughly read our tutorial: <q><a
                        href="explainGitShell.html" target="_blank">Guide
                        to Git Shell: Git and GitHub at Command Line</a></q>. It will benefit you to
                keep this tutorial open while you work on this assignment. Also, you should complete
                this assignment on a computer you will likely be using the most this semester,
                because you will be configuring it to get it working routinely with Git and GitHub
                and navigating your own file directories. (You can always set up Git on other
                computers when you need to and access GitHub wherever you are.)</p>

            <h3>Analysis of the task</h3>
            <p>The goals of this assignment are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Create a GitHub account</li>
                <li>Download Git on a local computer</li>
                <li>Understand where and how to access command line / terminal / git shell on your
                    local computer</li>
                <li>Navigate our <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ebeshero/DHClass-Hub"
                        >DHClass-Hub</a> repository on GitHub's web interface</li>
                <li>Comment and/or create an Issue on GitHub.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section title="step_by_step">
            <h3>Step By Step</h3>
            <p>Begin by navigating to our <a href="http://www.newtfire.org/dh/explainGitShell.html"
                    target="_blank">tutorial</a> and following the steps under <q>Let's Get
                    Started</q> to create a <a
                    href="explainGitShell.html#account" target="_blank"
                    >GitHub account</a> and <a
                    href="explainGitShell.html#setup" target="_blank"
                    >download Git Shell</a>. <strong>Do not rush through this process and be sure to
                    read thoroughly.</strong></p>
            <!-- RJP:2016-09-08: Add here link back to tutorial (section being developed) that discusses opening Command line based on platform and brief instructions to explore computer directories using command line. REVISED: THIS IS PART OF THE SETUP SECTION ON THE TUTORIAL.  -->
            <p>Once you have completed the above tasks navigate to our <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://github.com/ebeshero/DHClass-Hub">DHClass-Hub</a> repository. First
                read through the README.md file that displays at the bottom of the repo. This is a
                general welcome to the DHClass-Hub and details the basic workflow of using this
                repo.</p>
            <p>In order for you to contribute to the DHClass-Hub we will need to add you as a
                collaborator. This is the perfect moment to create and/or comment on a GitHub issue.
                Navigate to the <a href="https://github.com/ebeshero/DHClass-Hub" target="_blank"
                    >DHClass-Hub GitHub page</a>. At the top of the page, under
                    <q>ebeshero/DHClass-Hub</q> you will see a tab that says <q>Issues</q>. In our
                    <a href="https://github.com/ebeshero/DHClass-Hub/issues" target="_blank"
                    >DHClass-Hub Issues Board</a> notice there are open issues and closed issues.
                Search through the open issues for an issue where others are asking to be added as a
                collaborator using keywords like <q>collaborator</q> or <q>add to sandbox</q> in the
                search bar. If there is such an issue already existing click on it to create a
                comment. If there is not an existing issue click the <q>New issue</q> button at the
                top of the page.</p>
            <p><img src="NewIssue_GitEx1.jpg" alt="GitHub Issues Board" /></p>
            <p>As mentioned in our tutorial section <a href="explainGitShell.html#issue"
                    target="_blank"><q>GitHub as Social Media</q></a>, issues and their comments are
                written in <dfn>markdown language</dfn>. GitHub offers a comprehensive <a
                    href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/" target="_blank"
                    >guide to writing markdown</a> that you should reference as you find the
                necessity to create and comment on issues (especially when you want you to include
                segments of code). For the purposes of this assignment though you will only need to
                create an issue with the title <q>Adding Hub Collaborators</q> and/or comment in
                such an issue with your GitHub username <span class="smaller">(i.e. Dr.
                    Beshero-Bondar's username is <code>ebeshero</code>)</span>. Along with your
                username, also type the <code>@</code> symbol followed by Dr. Beshero-Bondar's
                username this will notify her to add you. In future issue comments use the
                    <code>@</code> and specify any GitHub user by their username and this will send
                an email or push notification to the user leading them to your comment as well as
                leave a link to their profile for the instances that you may be trying to designate
                credit to them. Your issue comment for this assignment should resemble this:</p>

            <p>We will be monitoring the issue board to add collaborators as they come in. As you
                wait for us to add you, take some time to read our <q><a target="_blank"
                        href="https://github.com/ebeshero/DHClass-Hub/issues/">Welcome to the Issues
                        Board</a></q> issue and our <a
                    href="https://github.com/ebeshero/DHClass-Hub/blob/master/Troubleshooting/Troubleshooting-Readme.md"
                    target="_blank">Troubleshooting-Readme</a>
                <span class="smaller">(which explains how to use the Troubleshooting folder in our
                    DHClass-Hub)</span>.</p>
