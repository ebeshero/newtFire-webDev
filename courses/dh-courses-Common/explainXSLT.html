      <h3>XSLT: eXtensible Stylesheet Language: Transformations</h3>
      			
      <p>XSLT is designed to transform XML into other kinds of XML, including HTML. First
         				designed in 1999, it co-evolved with XPath, with working groups at the W3 Consortium
         				collaborating on both. By 2007, both XPath and XSLT were well integrated together,
         				which made XSLT a very powerful transformation language, capable of executing
         very
         				precise manipulations and functions in remixing XML documents. That is really
         what
         				XSLT is for: It is called a <em>stylesheet language</em>, which might remind you of
         					<a href="explainCSS.html">CSS (Cascading Stylesheets)</a>, although CSS is very limited
         				by comparison with XSLT. CSS cannot change the order of elements or the content
         of a
         				document, but instead simply styles the elements already in place, as its functions
         				are limited to presentation and display. XSLT, by contrast, can generate new kinds
         				of documents from a base XML file, and was designed to translate one form of XML
         				into another form (as, for example: XML to XHTML, TEI to XHTML, XML to SVG (scalable
         				vector graphics, a form of XML that plots lines and shapes), or XML to KML (or
         					<em>Keyhole Markup Language</em>, a form of XML designed for plotting placemarks
         				and routes on Google Earth and other map interfaces.
      </p>
      			
      <p>XSLT is a kind of XML document, with a single root element, <span class="code">&lt;xsl:stylesheet&gt;</span> that contains some very important attributes that
         				define what the XSLT is transforming, from what and into what. Following that
         is an
         					<span class="code">&lt;xsl:output&gt;</span> statement that sets rules for the
         				output document. Then the rest of the document is typically a series of <span class="code">&lt;xsl:template&gt;</span> rules, which are written to
         					<strong>match</strong> on particular elements of the input document. The way
         				XSLT does this is different from most programming languages, which describe a
         set
         				order or procedure. By contrast, XSLT is a <em>declarative language</em>, which
         				means that its template rules <em>declare</em> what to do in the event a particular
         				element shows up in the document: The rules seek to match specific scenarios:
         If
         				there is a <span class="code">&lt;name&gt;</span> element, and a template rule to
         				match, <span class="code">&lt;template match="name"&gt;</span>, the rule will
         				“fire” and generate output according to scenario you have written in the
         				template. (So, for example, you might write a template rule that matches on all
         					<span class="code">&lt;name&gt;</span> elements in an XML file, and outputs them
         				all in an HTML list. Inside an <span class="code">&lt;xsl:template&gt;</span> is
         				typically an <span class="code">&lt;xsl:apply-templates&gt;</span> rule which
         				effectively calls on one or more of the elements in a file to be match the next
         				appropriate template for them.
      </p>
      			
      <p>To get started writing an XSLT file in &lt;oXygen/&gt; go to File→New Document,
         				and choose XSLT. Typically we write and run XSLT in oXygen using the “XSLT
         				debugger” view, which we show you in the graphic below. In that view, we
         				choose an input file and an XSLT file to run, select a kind of output, and produce
         				it in the output window on the right: 
      </p>
      			
      <div class="wideImage"><img src="ExplainXSLT_oXygenView.png" alt="screen capture in oXygen of XSLT debugger" /></div>
      			
      <h3>XSLT’s Built-in Rules</h3>
      			
      <p>You don’t have to write any rules at all in XSLT. You could simply write a stylesheet
         				with no template rules, and it would output all of the plain text of your document.
         				That’s because XSLT has built-in rules that by default with output text nodes
         				of all elements. The built-in rules start at the root of the element, and unless
         				they are told to stop or diverted by template rules they will walk the whole XML
         				tree and output any text they find. 
      </p>
      			
      <h3>XSLT Stylesheet and Output Elements</h3>
      			
      <p>If you open an XSLT stylesheet in &lt;oXygen/&gt;, as of 2016 you will see this
         				opening and root element. We will usually need to alter this a little: 
      </p>
      			
      <div class="code"> &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;<br /> &lt;xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"<br />
         				<span class="indent">xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"</span><br />
         				<span class="indent">exclude-result-prefixes="xs"</span><br />
         				<span class="indent">version="2.0"&gt;</span><br />
         				<br /> &lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt; 
      </div>
      			
      <p>The part of this we need to alter are the <span class="code">@xmlns</span>
         				attributes, usually to add something more. These are the <strong>namespace</strong>
         				declarations, which indicate the namespaces of the file from which we are reading
         				(our input XML document), and the output we are writing to (XML or HTML, etc).
         When
         				things go very badly wrong in XSLT and no output is generated at all, <em>it is nearly
         				always a namespace issue</em>: you may have forgotten to include the appropriate
         				namespaces! For example, in our work on the Digital Mitford project, and in some
         of
         				your homework exercises, you will need to be reading from the TEI namespace and
         be
         				outputting to XHTML: To do that you must add the appropriate attributes to the
         <span class="code">&lt;xsl:stylesheet&gt;</span>, indicating that TEI is the default
         					<strong>XPath namespace</strong> and that the XHTML namespace applies as well.
         				Here is our series of declarations that we would use <strong>to read from an input TEI XML document and output HTML 5</strong>:
      </p>
      			
      <div class="code"> &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;<br /> &lt;xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"<br />
         				<span class="indent"><span class="code">xpath-default-namespace="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"</span></span><br />
         				<span class="indent">xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"</span><br />
         				<span class="indent">xmlns:math="http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math"</span><br />
         				<span class="indent">exclude-result-prefixes="xs math"</span><br />
         				<span class="indent"><span class="code">xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"</span></span><br />
         				<span class="indent">version="3.0"&gt;</span><br />
         				<br /> &lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt; 
      </div>
      			
      <p>Of course we don’t bother to memorize this, and typically copy and paste the
         				namespace values from one file to the next (or by consulting pages like this
         				one)!
      </p>
      			
      <h4>The Output Statement</h4>
      			
      <p>We need to write another “top-level” statement (an immediate child of
         				the root element) that indicates the kind of output the XSLT file is generating.
         				(This is necessary to output a valid HTML 5 document written in XML syntax.) The
         					<span class="code">&lt;xsl:output/&gt;</span> element is self-closing, and its
         				first attribute, <span class="code">@method</span> needs to designate one of the
         				following options as its value: "xml" (which is the default), "xhtml", "html",
         and
         				"text".</p><p>We set "xhtml" here when outputting HTML 5 to avoid validation errors in
         our output. There are other attributes to place
         				on the output statement, which we’ll explain by walking through this
         				example:
      </p>
      			
      <div class="code"> &lt;xsl:output method="xhtml" encoding="utf-8" doctype-system="about:legacy-compat" 
         omit-xml-declaration="yes"/&gt; 
      </div>
      			
      <p>The method is set to xhtml to control the xml syntax of the output document (as HTML in XML form). We set <code>@encoding</code> to utf-8,
         				because it’s the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">universal
            					Unicode character set</a>, the most widely compatible character set for use on
         				the World Wide Web. The <span class="code">@doctype-system</span>, must be set to generate an HTML 5 doctype declaration in your output.
         Lastly we set <code>@omit-xml-declaration</code> to "yes" to suppress the xml line at the top of the output HTML <span class="smaller">(The precise setting of the @doctype-system attribute is, as of February
            2016, the easiest way in XSLT to generate the current doctype statement for HTML 5,
            and the “about:legacy-compat” part of it is actually for compatibility with software
            that outputs HTML rather than compatibility with browsers.)</span>.</p>
      			
      <h4>White Space: Preserve or Destroy</h4>
      			
      <p>The last top-level elements we need to tell you about are for controlling white space
         				in your output. These are optional, but occasionally really necessary depending
         on
         				the output you need and the state of your source file: 
      </p>
      			
      <div class="code"> &lt;xsl:strip-space elements="day month year"/&gt;<br /><br />
         				&lt;xsl:preserve-space elements="p li name"/&gt; 
      </div>
      			
      <p>Use <span class="code">xsl:strip-space</span> to remove white space inside the
         				elements in the list. Notice that the attribute (<code>@elements</code>) takes a space-delimited list of element names. The idea is that
         				you may need to remove extra spaces in the text of some of your elements, such
         as
         				new-line characters and indentations at beginnings of lines, so you use strip-space
         				to systematically remove them all. By contrast, you’d use <span class="code">xsl:preserve-space</span> to keep the white space.
      </p>
      			
      <p>Usually we don’t need these elements, but when you need them you will know, because
         				your output will have too much white space, or your formatting will be all
         				wrong.
      </p>
      			
      <h3>Template Rules</h3>
      			
      <p>The main part of the XSLT stylesheet are its template rules. When you write an <span class="code">xsl:template</span>, you specify an <span class="code">@match</span> attribute which calls out to particular elements. The value of
         @match can be described as <em><q>XPath-like</q></em> or an <em><q>XPath pattern</q></em>: This is because we do not designate the
         				template <span class="code">@match</span> to walk down the XML document tree. No.
         				Instead, the elements <em>come to the template rule</em>, and if you were to write a
         				full XPath expression with the leading // to designate walking down from the root,
         				that would have no effect. With xsl:template rules, the elements in the input XML
         				are matched <em>out of context with their hierarchy</em>. For example, if you have written a
         				template match for <code>&lt;xsl:template match="div"&gt;</code>, that
         				rule is going to “fire” any time a <code>div </code>comes
         				by from the source document. 
      </p>
      			
      <p>That can be really useful if we want a template rule to match all the divs in the hierarchy and treat them the same way. But usually that is not what we want. This is
         where the <em>“XPath-like”</em> or <em>XPath-pattern</em> syntax comes in: In a file with a complex hierarchy, like one of our Pacific Voyage Narratives, you may want to process Book (<span class="code">&lt;div&gt;</span> elements directly under the <span class="code">&lt;body&gt;</span>) differently from Chapter (<span class="code">&lt;div&gt;</span> elements directly under Books), and so, using <strong>XPath-like</strong> syntax for <span class="code">@match</span>, you can write one template rule for
         					<span class="code">match="body/div"</span> and another for <span class="code">match="div/div"</span>. You can also use predicates; for example, to process
         				only the date elements for the year 1769, you can write a rule for <span class="code">xsl:template
            					match="date[contains(., '1769')]"</span>. Those template rules will only match on
         				the special cases you designate as they come up, wherever they come up in the document.
      </p>
      			
      <p>To write a complete template rule, you first have to <em>call</em> for a particular kind of node
         in your document (usually an element, but maybe other things), and then you have
         to <em>do some action with it</em>. The action usually creates output nodes, and then goes on
         to <strong>apply templates</strong> to the children of the current context node
         				that has come by. So, to output lines of poetry in the form of HTML paragraphs
         				so you can preserve the line breaks, you could write the following template rule:
      </p>
      			
      <div class="code"> &lt;xsl:template match="line"&gt;<br />
         				<span class="indent">&lt;p&gt;</span><br />
         				<span class="indentMore">&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;</span><br />
         				<span class="indent">&lt;/p&gt;</span><br /> &lt;/xsl:template&gt;<br />
         			
      </div>
      			
      <p>Here is what happens when this rule fires: A <span class="code">&lt;line&gt;</span>
         element drifts by this template rule and is caught by the <span class="code">@match</span> attribute. The template takes its contents (basically <em>consumes</em> the node), and in its place it outputs an HTML <span class="code">&lt;p&gt;</span>.
         				What’s inside that <span class="code">&lt;p&gt;</span> element generates its
         				contents: <span class="code">&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;</span> by itself with no
         				attributes says, process the contents (the text contents) of this element it is consuming. <span class="code">&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;</span> will process the contents of
         					<span class="code">&lt;line&gt;</span> and pass its child nodes on to the
         				templates that apply to them. 
      </p>
      			
      <p>You might want to process something in particular in a template rule, to direct <span class="code">&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;</span> to a next element that you want
         				to be consumed in this particular position: perhaps something specific you would
         want to see
         				next within the HTML element you are constructing, to restrict what comes next.
         For example, say you are working with our <a href="ForsterGeorgComplete.xml">Georg Forster Pacific Voyage text coded in TEI</a>, and you do not want to output the entire document. Say you only want to output a pair of nested HTML lists: Inside an outer list, we want to generate the chapter headings in the Forster file, and inside each chapter list entry, we want to make an inside list of each of the place names we have tagged inside that chapter (not worrying for the moment about whether those place names are repeated in the chapter). We will do this with an HTML unordered list (coded with an outer <span class="list">ul</span> and an inner series of <span class="list">li</span> (list items), with an outer list containing the Chapter headings and an inner list
         for each chapter holding the <span class="code">&lt;placeName&gt;</span> elements within it. For this transformation from TEI we are going to need three template
         rules, to sit at different levels of our stylesheet. Here’s how we wrote it:
      </p>

                &lt;h1&gt;Places Listed in Each Chapter of Georg Forster’s Voyage Record&lt;/h1&gt;
                &lt;ul&gt;
                    <span class="code">&lt;xsl:apply-templates select="//text/body//div[@type='chapter']"/&gt;</span>
                &lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;/body&gt;
        &lt;/html&gt;
    <span class="code">&lt;/xsl:template&gt;</span>
   <span class="code"> &lt;xsl:template match="div[@type='chapter']"&gt;</span>
        &lt;li&gt;
            <span class="code">&lt;xsl:apply-templates select="head/l"/&gt;</span>
            &lt;ul&gt;
                <span class="code">&lt;xsl:apply-templates select="descendant::p/placeName"/&gt;</span>
                <span style="color:green;">&lt;!--ebb: In this stylesheet, we wanted to include only the placeName elements inside the body paragraphs of the chapters. 
                   So we set our @select statement to step down and collect only these placeNames --&gt;</span>
            &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
    <span class="code">&lt;/xsl:template&gt;</span>
    <span class="code">&lt;xsl:template match="p/placeName"&gt;</span>
        <span style="color:green;">&lt;!--ebb: This template rule matches on a pattern: 
           Any time this rule is called, it finds a placeName that is the child of a body paragraph. 
           In the previous template rule, we called for this template to be applied *only selectively* 
           that is, *only to the placeNames inside the paragraphs within chapter div elements.* 
           So this template rule will only fire under those selective conditions. --&gt;</span>
        <span class="code">&lt;li&gt;&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;</span>
        <span style="color:green;">&lt;!--ebb: When we don't use an <code>@select</code> on apply-templates, we simply pass the contents of the current element being processed on to whatever template rules 
           in the document are ready to process it, and if there is only plain text inside, plain text will be output. 
           Try copying and pasting this XSLT into oXygen, run it over the Georg Forster file, and study the output HTML. 
           As you’ll see from the output, perhaps we should consider modifying this rule! 
           We seem to be outputting note elements that are children of placeName in this document, which introduces some clutter to our output results! 
           Sometimes running a transformation can show us some things we may want to change about our source code, 
           or things we can try to exclude or modify in our XSLT transformation. --&gt;</span>
        &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
   
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;			
         			
      </pre>
      			
      <p>In the stylesheet above, the very first template rule matches on <span class="code">"/"</span>, and that indicates the XML root element. When we transform XML to HTML we begin with this 
         template match on root, so that we say the basic structural elements of the XML file are to be replaced by the basic structural elements of an HTML document. 
         We begin basically writing the document hierarchy of an HTML page, from its <span class="code">&lt;html&gt;</span> document node (or root) onward, any <strong>outer level</strong> element that we expect to appear <strong>only once</strong> in the document hierarchy. 
         So up here in the template rule matching on the document node, we plot out the basic structural units of the HTML file and we set up the outer element that creates any unordered list or table we need. 
         Where we need to reach in and grab more deeply nested, repeating elements in the hierarchy, we need to invoke and fire new template rules, via <span class="code">xsl:apply-templates</span>, 
         which we can specify as needed with the <span class="code">@select</span> attribute to direct which parts of the XML file will be consumed and processed in particular lists or positions in the output HTML document. Notice that the <span class="code">@select</span> attribute on <span class="code">xsl:apply-templates</span> is a <strong>literal XPath expression</strong>. In the template rule matching <span class="code">div @type="chapter"</span> we see two ways of stepping down into a literal XPath from the current context node,
         whatever it is: In the <em>first</em> <span class="code">xsl:apply-templates @select</span>, we step into a child node and then down another path step to the <span class="code">&lt;l&gt;</span> (or line) element that is the child of head:
         <span class="code">head/l</span>. In the <em>second</em> <span class="code">xsl:apply-templates @select</span>, we reach down the <code>descendant::</code> axis <em>from the current template match</em> (or <dfn>context node</dfn>) to select a specific node to process next. We could also have written that <code>xsl:apply-templates @select</code> like this:</p>
         <div class="code">
            <span class="code"> &lt;xsl:template match="div[@type='chapter']"&gt;</span>
            &lt;li&gt;
            <span class="code">&lt;xsl:apply-templates select="head/l"/&gt;</span>
            &lt;ul&gt;
            <span class="code">&lt;xsl:apply-templates select="<span style="color:red;">.//</span>p/placeName"/&gt;</span>
    
            &lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            <span class="code">&lt;/xsl:template&gt;</span>
         </div>
  <p>        
     Here we used the <strong><q>dot</q> notation</strong> to indicate the current context node. This <q>dot</q> notation, <span class="code">.</span>, is very important
     because when there is nothing indicated to the left of it our <span class="code">//</span> descendent axis notation (or a <span class="code">/</span> child axis notation) would otherwise be read as starting from <em>the root of the XML tree</em> and heading all the way down, rather than reading within a specific chapter and looking all the way down through its children and children ’s children <em>only within the chapter</em>.  This is because <span class="code">xsl:apply-templates @select</span> is a <strong>literal XPath expression</strong> that <em>must be defined in terms of the current context node</em>, quite unlike what we described with the <strong><q>XPath-like</q></strong> syntax in the template’s <span class="code">@match</span>. Notice that we only need to use the dot notation when we are designating the descendant axis with its abbreviated double-slash form from the current context node . We do not use it here to step down to the <em>immediate child</em>  or over to <em>an attribute</em> on the current context node: we can simply designate those by element name or by @attribute and no slash is necessary (so therefore no dot notation is necessary either). So that is why we wrote: <span class="code">&lt;xsl:apply-templates select="head/l"/&gt;</span> in the first template rule above; but we wrote <span class="code">&lt;xsl:apply-templates select="descendant::p/placeName"/&gt;</span> in the same rule, in order to step down the descendant axis from the context node. After all, we do not need to use the dot if we always <strong>specify the axis name</strong> at the start of the @select value, and we think it is best practice always to specify the axis direction here.

      <h4>Calculating and Outputting XPath Functions</h4>
      			
      <p>If we wanted to calculate a <span class="code">count()</span> or take the <span class="code">distinct-values()</span> of a series of output elements, or calculate and output <span class="code">string-length()</span> of a node, or otherwise execute XPath functions, we would write something like this:
         <span class="code">&lt;xsl:value-of select="count(placeName)"/&gt;</span>, to deliver the <strong>calculated value</strong> of something. We would use this in place of our usual <span class="code">&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;</span></p>
      			
      <h4>Totally suppressing a node:</h4>
      			
      <p>One way not to output anything for an element is to write an empty template rule for
         it! For example, you could ensure that none of your paragraphs were ever output if
         you wrote the following:
      </p> 
      				
      <div class="code">&lt;xsl:template match="p"/&gt;
         				
         				
         				
      </div>
      			
      <p>This works to suppress the built-in rule to output text when no rules are defined,
         and effectively suppresses your paragraphs. 
      </p>
      			
      			
      		
      <h4>XSLT Processing: Understanding the Difference between <span class="code">@match</span> and <span class="code">@select</span>:
      </h4>
      			
      <p>Use <span class="code">@match</span> only when we’re defining a template rule.
      </p>  
      			
      <div class="code">	&lt;xsl:template <span class="code">match="a-pattern-wherever-it-is-that-we-want-to-match"</span>&gt;<br />
         
         					<span class="indent" style="color:green;">&lt;!--INSIDE HERE we write code to process what we’ve matched, and we instruct XSLT what to
            do next from this point in the document.--&gt;</span><br />
         					
         					&lt;/xsl:template/&gt;<br />
         				
      </div>
      			
      <p>We use <span class="code">@select</span> in the internal part, on one of two XSLT elements: <span class="code">&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;</span> or <span class="code">&lt;xsl:value-of/&gt;</span>.
      </p>
      				
      				
      				
      			
      <div class="code">			&lt;xsl:template match="wherever-it-is-that-we-want-to-match"&gt;<br/>	
         					<span class="indent">&lt;newElement&gt; <span style="color:green;">&lt;!--This is the new element we want to show up in the transformed document--&gt;</span></span><br />
         					<span class="indentMore">&lt;xsl:apply-templates <span class="code">select="something-related-by-XPath-to-this-point-we’ve-matched</span>&gt;</span><br />
         				<span class="indent">&lt;/newElement&gt;</span><br/>
         				&lt;/xsl:template&gt;
      </div>
      				
      			
      <p>We don’t have to use <span class="code">@select</span> at all! We could simply go with <span class="code">&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;</span> if we want to duplicate ALL the contents of the thing we’ve matched in this place.
         We use <span class="code">@select</span> when we need to be <strong>selective</strong> about what we’re going to process at the points of our match. So, let’s think about
         this with a couple of examples, one that uses <span class="code">&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;</span> with NO <span class="code">@select</span> attribute, and one that uses <span class="code">@select</span>.
      </p>
      				
      			
      <p><strong>Example 1: simple <span class="code">&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;</span>  (no <span class="code">@select</span>):</strong></p>
      				
      				
      <div class="code">
         					&lt;xsl:template match="div/div//head"&gt;<br />
         					
         					<span class="indent">&lt;h1&gt; &lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt; &lt;/h1&gt;</span><br />
         					
         					&lt;/xsl:template&gt;
         				
      </div>
      				
      				
      			
      <p>This template rule makes an <span class="code">@match</span> on something "XPath-like":  We use XPath syntax to define it, but notice that it
         is NOT a full XPath expression, because we can’t see where it originates: we haven’t
         defined a path down to it from the root element. But what we’re doing is looking for
         a pattern, wherever it turns up in the XML tree: wherever we see a <span class="code">div/div//head</span> (or a head element that sits in a configuration like this), go match on it, whether
         it appears up near the root element, or down inside a body paragraph).  When we are
         there, the rule says, output an &lt;h1&gt; HTML element (for a top-level heading in HTML),
         and inside output the full contents of our XML &lt;head&gt; element, and then go on and
         process any children of head by the other template rules I’ve written in this XSLT
         file: Apply templates from this point on down the XML tree.
      </p>
      					
      					
      <p>vs.</p>
      			
      <p><strong>Example 2: <span class="code">&lt;xsl:apply-templates select=".//something"&gt;</span>  using <span class="code">@select</span> (when and why we do it):</strong></p>
      						
      			
      <div class="code">&lt;xsl:template match="placeName"&gt;<br />
         							
         							<span class="indent">&lt;strong&gt; &lt;xsl:apply-templates select="@ref"/&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;</span><br />
         							
         							&lt;/xsl:template&gt;
      </div>
      						
      			
      <p>This rule says, first of all, make a template <span class="code">@match</span> on <strong>any</strong> <span class="code">placeName</span>, wherever it appears in my XML input file. When you are there, <span class="code">&lt;xsl:apply-templates select="@ref"&gt;</span> says, go and process <strong>selectively</strong>: We don’t want the whole output here: What we want is ONLY the contents of the @ref
         attribute sitting on <span class="code">&lt;placeName ref="Someplace"&gt;text-content-here &lt;/placeName&gt;</span>.  The template rule will go and read the contents of the <span class="code">@ref</span> attribute and output it here in the transformed HTML, wrapped in a <span class="code">&lt;strong&gt;</span> element to present it as bold. <span class="code">&lt;xsl:apply-templates select="@ref"&gt;</span> also says "go and apply the other template rules on this sheet to any children of
         <span class="code">placeName</span> (if there are any).
      </p>
      							
      							
      <p>Think of <span class="code">@select</span> this way:
      </p>
      			
      <div class="code">	&lt;xsl:apply-templates select="XPath-from-this-point"&gt; </div>
      			
      <p>Wherever our template rule has matched, the <span class="code">apply-templates @select</span> expresses <strong>a definite XPath from that point</strong>—usually to a child element or to an attribute, or to some specific point that you
         want to process so that you <strong>don’t</strong> output the full content of the thing the template has matched on.  Use <span class="code">@select</span> when you want to define very specific output.
      </p>
