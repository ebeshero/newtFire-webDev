            <p>Digital humanities is an area of study that explores the intersection of computing
                and the humanities. Often, computing tools are used to answer humanities based
                research questions. Digital humanities, or humanities computing, is becoming an
                increasingly prevalent area of academic study. In particular, digital humanities
                scholarship is beginning to permeate the study of literature. The recent increase in
                digital texts is not only impacting the accessibility of texts, but is also
                challenging concepts of textuality and redefining literary scholarship. Part of this
                trend is necessitated by cultural shifts: in the age of Google Books, blogs, online
                newspapers, and Wikipedia, it would be negligent for scholars to ignore the changing
                relationships between reader, scholar, and text. Because of digital texts, more
                readers are able to access literary scholarship and perform their own textual
                research. For example, the search function available in most digital documents
                allows any reader to instantaneously determine word frequencies. Many websites
                display textual information, data, and visualizations that would be inaccessible or
                unavailable without computing tools.<a href="#F1" id="f1" class="footnote"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
            <!--By making the footnotes links, the user is able 
            to jump from the text to the footnotes and back-->
            <!-- <p> tags are just paragraphs.-->
            <p>Digital humanities is not only impacting the presentation and accessibility of
                resources, but is also creating opportunities for scholars to ask new questions; the
                integration of computing tools into literary research is shaping the way scholars
                can interrogate their texts. This is not to say that the study of digital humanities
                is making literary research more objective. The anxiety that computing tools are
                taking the “human” out of the humanities overlooks the fact that computers do not
                have the power to analyze or interpret data. Thomas Rommel, a literary scholar and
                digital humanist, astutely points out in “A Companion to Digital Humanities” that
                the strength of using computing tools in literary scholarship is that they provide
                speed, accuracy, unlimited memory, and instantaneous access to virtually all textual
                features, but are still completely reliant on the scholar.<a href="#F2" id="f2" class="footnote"><sup>2</sup></a> The systematic analysis of literature based on
                quantitative textual features has always been a part of literary study. For example,
                scholars have used concordances for centuries to study patterns and data sets
                present in a text. Digital tools allow scholars to sample larger amounts of texts
                and perform a more complete comparison of the differences among sets of texts. If
                anything, with more data readily available at their fingertips, scholars have to
                work harder to figure out which lines of inquiry will yield productive results.</p>
            <p> Understanding these emerging relationships involves investigating how digital texts
                themselves are created, a process at the heart of all digital humanities
                scholarship. This paper seeks to further the idea that the advent of digital texts
                and technologies in the humanities must be met with a critical interrogation of the
                procedures being used and the ideologies behind them. This is not a new idea; the
                study of how transcription methods and editing practices affect print texts is well
                established. Many similarities can be found between the creation of digital and
                print versions of a text. The encoding process demands that the scholar makes a
                decision in terms of classifying elements of the text. Similarly, when new versions
                of a print text are created, editorial decisions are often made about ambiguous
                elements of the text. For example, the punctuation used in different print versions
                of William Blake’s <cite>Songs of Innocence and Experience</cite> widely varies because the
                intended punctuation in the illuminated versions is unclear.<a href="#F3" id="f3" class="footnote"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
            <p>There are differences between the two processes as well. Perhaps most significantly,
                even if a transcribed digital copy of a text is formatted in the same way as the
                print version, acts of interpretation and classification occur during the encoding
                process and exist in the marked up version. This is because the process of markup
                used in digital humanities is intended to be descriptive.<a href="#F4" id="f4" class="footnote"><sup>4</sup></a> This is not the case in the creation of a
                printed text. If the goal of creating a print transcription is to visually reproduce
                the text, classifications of meaning do not have to be made. In such a case, whether
                or not the mark at the end of a poem was intended as a period or a comma is
                irrelevant, it’s shape, color, and size are important. However, in the creation of a
                digital version of a text, decisions about classification are made even if the focus
                is on rendering a digital version that is visually similar to the original. In
                addition, the marked up version of a text exists for as long as the “readable”
                version exists. As a related point, different modes of classification and textual
                interpretation in the creation of a digital text can be made to achieve the same
                visual result.</p>
            <h3><a id="P2" href="#p2" class="title">The Implications of Encoding</a></h3>
            <p>If it is true that the interpretive decisions made “behind the scenes” do not
                necessarily affect the presentation of the text, why do the methodologies used for
                encoding matter? The answer to this question has three components. The first is that
                while descriptive markup may not affect the potential visual presentation of the
                text, it does significantly affect any queries run on the text. For example, suppose
                a scholar encounters a text in which the content between quotation marks includes
                words that are not part of a spoken quotation:</p>
            <div class="code">“Hello, said the girl, how are you?”</div>
            <p>Assuming that the scholar does not want to compromise the integrity of the text by
                relocating the questions marks, she is faced with a number of ways to classify and
                interpret this text: she could label the example as either one or two separate
                quotations. Whether or not the scholar decides to label this instance as one
                quotation or two quotations separated by the phrase “said the girl” does not impact
                the way that the text can be rendered after the markup process. However, the
                methodology would affect a count of quotations within the text and would also impact
                the number of letters contained within the quotation.<a href="#F5" id="f5" class="footnote"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
            <p>The second reason that the encoded text is important is that the creation of a
                digital text is an active, interpretive process. This process is cyclical: on the
                one hand the scholar’s understanding of the text shapes the way in which she chooses
                to encode the text. On the other hand, the constraints of the markup process and the
                ideology behind it affect the way the scholar perceives the text. This last point is
                particularly relevant, though it has been largely ignored, when discussing the
                importance of markup philosophy, since it acknowledges the potential for the system
                of formalizing a text to limit the literary scholar. It also suggests that the study
                of markup should be focused on the activity of encoding and how the scholar
                interacts with this process.<a href="#F6" id="f6" class="footnote"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
            <p>Building off of the relationship between markup and scholar, it becomes clear that
                the rules and constraints of the markup system used can impact the reader as well.
                The scholar’s choices of categorization and formalization may impact a reader’s
                interpretation of the text. For example, if a reader were to observe that a line of
                a poem by John Donne had been encoded as an example of “metaphysicalDeceit,”<a href="#F7" id="f7" class="footnote"><sup>7</sup></a> their interpretation of
                the line might change in the same way it would from reading a piece of criticism.<a href="#F8" id="f8" class="footnote"><sup>8</sup></a> This makes sense, since
                both the markup process and literary criticism are based on interpretation. However,
                since the scholar’s acts of interpretation are in part based on the constraints of
                the markup system, the reader’s perception of the text is indirectly influenced by
                the markup system.</p>
            <p>This argument is dependent on the reader seeing and understanding the encoded text.
                Because most people who read digital texts do not observe them in their encoded
                form, this is a weak argument. However, it is likely that over the next several
                years coding literacy will increase, making it more probable that readers will view
                the source files of documents. The motivation behind this might come from a desire
                to “decode” the code, or understand the methods of interpretation and inscription
                behind any given text, something that is present in the study and consumption of
                print media today. A more immediate and convincing argument about the relationship
                between reader and scholar is that the digital resources and information available
                to the general public are determined by the questions a scholar asks of her texts.
                By way of a trickle down effect then, the structure of the markup system also
                impacts readers even if they have not viewed a text in its encoded form.</p>
            <p> In light of the relationships between text, markup, scholar, and reader, the next
                logical question is: What are the constraints of current markup procedure, and how
                are they impacting research? In order to fully discuss this question, it is
                necessary to give some background information about the history and evolution of
                text encoding.</p>
            <h3><a id="P3" href="#p3" class="title">Text Encoding</a></h3>
            <p>The most current and widely used method of describing, or marking up, a text so that
                it is machine-readable, is XML (eXtensible Markup Language). XML grew of out of SGML
                (Standard Generalized Markup Language), a language that was developed for data
                encoding and the sharing of machine-readable texts in the late 1980’s. It is
                important to note that, although SGML was developed to encode texts, its original
                goals were very different from the way humanities scholars now use XML. SGML was
                intended to facilitate the sharing and storage of large-project documents in law,
                government, and industry.<a href="#F9" id="f9" class="footnote"><sup>9</sup></a>
                When SGML was developed it was assumed that the system of formal features described
                would be based exclusively on a text’s genre. SGML was not developed for application
                in humanities scholarship and the primary concerns driving its creation were
                practical. One such practical concern focused on creating a model that would be
                accessible and easy to use.<a href="#F10" id="f10" class="footnote"><sup>10</sup></a> The history and development of text encoding suggest that it
                might be necessary for literary scholars to reassess and reclaim the tools they are
                currently using. It seems strange that methodologies developed around principles of
                practicality are being used to determine textual interpretation and meaning. This
                begs the question: Are the text encoding methodologies used in literary scholarship
                rooted in principles foreign to their current purpose and use?</p>
            <p>Surprisingly, most of the scholarship on the philosophy of markup is from the 1980’s
                and 1990’s and is thus focused on SGML as opposed to XML. The discontinuation of the
                SGML debate was not a result of significant improvements. Rather, it seems as if
                with the creation of XML, most scholars accepted the shortcomings of SGML and XML as
                unavoidable. Although there are differences between SGML and XML they both share the
                same formal logic. Encoding a text with XML involves wrapping the text in tags,
                markup that describes components of the text. Tags divide the text into elements.
                Elements include tags and everything in between them. For example, in the following
                sample the text, “This is a sample,” is wrapped between a sentence start tag and a
                sentence end tag. End tags always contain a slash. The entire example constitutes a
                sentence element.</p>
            <div class="code"><code>&lt;sentence&gt;</code>This is a sample.<code>&lt;/sentence&gt;</code></div>
            <p>XML, unlike most other languages, does not have predefined tag sets. This essentially
                means that the scholar determines the “name” of a tag. In the above example the word
                “sentence” could be replaced with any other word and still be processed the same
                way. Other languages may include syntax that seems deceptively like prose, for
                example Shakespeare language allows the user to program by creating sentences
                including nouns, adjectives, characters, and scenes. However, such languages, unlike
                XML, do not allow for the valid input of virtually any Unicode character.<a href="#F11" id="f11" class="footnote"><sup>11</sup></a> This aspect of XML
                makes it remarkably similar to a human language, and in fact the experience of
                writing XML is in many ways similar to writing prose. However, it is important to
                remember that the “names” are not read or understood by the computer. Because humans
                can comprehend the words written in XML, it is easy to think that a computer is
                processing the text in a similar way. However, the computer is processing XML as
                binary machine code.</p>
            <p> Writing in a language that does not have pre-defined tag sets increases the effect
                of the markup process on the scholar. For example, take the following sample of
                text:</p>
           <div class="code">“-able wind. Considering the grand way these moments are photographed, it almost
                appears as if Navidson is trying through ever the most quotidian objects and events
                to evoke for us some senses of Holloway's epic progress. That or participate in it.
                Perhaps even challenge it.”<a href="#F12" id="f12" class="footnote"><sup>12</sup></a></div><p style="font-size: small;">To interact with a digital
                    version of <i>House of Leaves</i>, click <a href="http://markzdanielewski.info/hol/holuk/holreadframe.html">here</a></p>
            <p>In its source document, the above snippet of text was displayed with line breaks
                between a preceding and following paragraph. If the scholar were to encode this
                snippet of text with HTML, a language with predefined tag sets, a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>
                tag, or paragraph tag, would most likely be used. There are no other options in HTML
                that come close to describing the above sample. However, being given the complete
                freedom to “name” the sample makes the classification more difficult. It also makes
                it more thought provoking. Is it in fact a paragraph? The first word, which is part
                of “untouchable,” is cut off and there is no indentation. The scholar could choose
                to label the sample as any number of things, including
                <code>&lt;paragraph&gt;, &lt;text_block&gt;, or  &lt;incomplete_p&gt;</code>. Each of these options
                represents a separate interpretation of the text.</p>
            <p>Though the scholar is free to choose the words that describe the text, SGML, XML, and
                the TEI, a standardized subset of XML that includes its own rules and list of valid
                textual components, have specific rules about the way in which the text can be
                tagged. All of these languages are based on the idea that texts can be represented
                as ordered hierarchies of content objects (OHCO). This approach is modeled after the
                computer science concept of a tree data structure. Tree structures are based on a
                hierarchy in which individual components, or nodes, form parent, child, and sibling
                relationships. In the following diagram, the parent node is represented by box A.
                Boxes B, C, and F are siblings because they are the immediate children of A.</p>
            <img src="dom2.gif" alt="diagram"/><a href="#F13" id="f13" class="footnote"><sup>13</sup></a>
            <p>The rules of XML revolve around forming and maintaining this type of hierarchal
                structure. If the structure produced does not follow these rules, it is said to be
                invalid, and cannot be processed. In order for a document to be valid, it must have
                a root node and be properly nested. A root node is the topmost node in a tree and
                consequently is the only node not to have a parent. In this diagram the root node
                would be box A. In order for markup to be properly nested, there must be no
                overlapping hierarchies.<a href="#F14" id="f14" class="footnote"><sup>14</sup></a>
                If the text is going to be used for research purpose, after it has been marked up,
                the hierarchal structure is used to traverse the document and pull out information
                relevant to a scholar’s query.</p>
            <p>Overall, the tree based approach works very well. Having to impose a hierarchical
                structure often leads scholars to notice new or unusual structural features of a
                text. Perhaps this explains why in the last fifteen years there have been very few
                works of scholarship that explore or criticize this model and few attempts have been
                made to refine it.<a href="#F15" id="f15" class="footnote"><sup>15</sup></a> The
                main reason for the success of OHCO based system is that most texts lend themselves
                well to a hierarchical structure. Books contain chapters that contain paragraphs
                that contain sentences etc. However, this model is not foolproof. In particular,
                many texts contain overlapping hierarchies. Although there are a variety of methods
                in place to circumvent this issue, overlapping hierarchies need to be thought of as
                something more than an “exception” to the rule. The fact that they exist at all
                suggests a more fundamental problem with the way that hierarchy based methods define
                a text.</p>
            <h3><a id="P4" href="#p4" class="title">Overlapping Hierarchies</a></h3>
            <p>SGML was originally intended to represent a single, logical, hierarchy in a document.
                It was assumed that each document could only have one logical hierarchy and that the
                hierarchy would be determinate on genre. For example, the typical document hierarchy
                for a script might be: cast list, performance history, title, stage directions, act,
                scene, line.<a href="#F16" id="f16" class="footnote"><sup>16</sup></a> Once SGML
                and XML started to be used for literary scholarship, it became obvious that there is
                no single “standard” hierarchy for any given text. Hierarchy came to be dependent on
                interpretation. Thus, markup reflects a theory of text; there are an unlimited
                number of logical hierarchies to be found and encoded in any document. This
                realization opened up the door for a number of problems.</p>
            <p>Overlapping hierarchies can occur almost anywhere including the following: when a
                paragraph extends over multiple pages, when a metaphor extends over multiple
                sentences, when attempting to encode the hidden message in an acrostic. While
                overlapping hierarchies can occur in any genre of text, they are often found in
                poetry. This type of overlapping hierarchy is often caused by enjambment. Take for
                instance, the poem “The Unrhymable Word: Orange” by Willard Espy: “The four
                eng-/ineers/Wore orange/brassieres.”<a href="#F17" id="f17" class="footnote"><sup>17</sup></a> If a scholar attempted to tag both the lines and the
                words in this poem, the first two lines would create an overlapping hierarchy:</p>
            <div class="badCode"><span class="red">&lt;line&gt;</span><span class="purple">&lt;word&gt;</span>eng-<span class="red">&lt;/line&gt;</span>ineers<span class="purple">&lt;/word&gt;</span></div>.
            <p>The relationship between words and lines in this poem does not corresponded to a
                strictly parent, child, and sibling structure. The first diagram shows the
                relationships between lines and words that exist in the poem; it shows the
                interconnected and overlapping nature of the structure. The second diagram shows the
                type of relationship that OHCO and XML require the scholar to conform to.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="venntarget.png" alt="diagram"/><a href="#F18" id="f18" class="footnote"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
            <p>
                <img src="ohcotarget.png" alt="diagram"/></p>
            <p>There are numerous ways to sidestep this problem, one of which would be to use empty
                elements to delineate the start and end of the word “engineers.” Empty elements are
                self-contained units; they are simultaneously a start and an end tag. The syntax for
                such a tag is to insert a slash before the closing bracket: <code>&lt;tag&gt;</code>.
                These tags do not wrap around text. Often they are used to include metadata. Using
                them in the above poem would look like the following:</p>
            <div class="code"><span class="red">&lt;line&gt;</span>The four<span class="purple">&lt;word/&gt;</span>eng-<span class="red">&lt;/line&gt;</span>ineers<span class="purple">&lt;word/&gt;</span></div>
            <p>While this type of solution does allow the scholar to search for the text between two
                empty element tags, it does not acknowledge the existence of an overlapping
                hierarchy of word and line elements. Essentially, it is a way of tricking the
                system. Since the purpose of XML is to describe a text, this does not seem like an
                adequate solution. Other potential solutions deal with the issue in a similar way
                and none reconcile the formative nature of the text with the hierarchal model of the
                markup procedure. Many scholars ignore the broader implications of overlapping
                hierarchies, some address the problem in a way that attempts to reconcile its
                existence with the basic premises of the OHCO model, but very few think that
                overlapping hierarchies invalidate the OHCO hypothesis.</p>
            <h3><a id="P5" href="#p5" class="title">Why OHCO?</a></h3>
            <p>There are several different reasons why digital humanists support the idea that a
                text can be described in terms of ordered hierarchies. The supporters of OHCO can be
                split into two major subgroups: those who support the model for practical reasons
                and those who support it for ontological reasons. Often, the line between these two
                groups is blurred. The ontological approach seeks to answer the question: “What is
                text?” and proposes the answer: “Text is an ordered hierarchy of content objects.”
                The logic for this argument revolves around the idea that the meaning of text can be
                deduced from determining the parts of a text that, if taken away, change the text
                into a new text.</p>
            <p>In a paper that seeks to defend the OHCO model, “What is Text, Really?,” the authors
                give the following train of reasoning: “The essential parts of any document form
                what we call ‘content objects,’ and are of many types, such as paragraphs,
                quotations, emphatic phrases, and attributions. Each type of content object usually
                has its own appearance when a document is printed or displayed, but that appearance
                is superficial and transient rather than essential.”<a href="#F19" id="f19" class="footnote"><sup>19</sup></a> According to this theory, if ‘content
                objects’ are changed, either by removing them or changing their order, a new
                document is produced. If formatting, such as font type, is changed the text remains
                the same. The authors go on to say that “most content objects are contained in
                larger content objects, such as subsections, sections, and chapters…Generally,
                smaller content objects do not cross the boundaries of larger ones; thus a paragraph
                will not begin in one chapter and end in the next. For this reason, the structure of
                a document is a hierarchical one, like a tree.”<a href="#F20" id="f20" class="footnote"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
            <p>There are several problems with this reasoning. In a paper that criticizes this
                argument, “Refining Our Notion of What Text Really Is: The Problem of Overlapping
                Hierarchies,” the authors point out that even the ontological argument in favor of
                OHCO is motivated by practicality: “The partisans of content-oriented text
                processing and descriptive markup claimed that treating texts as if they were
                ordered hierarchies of content objects had many practical benefits, while
                alternative representational practices resulted in various inefficiencies and
                inadequacies. It was a short step from noting the practical advantages of treating
                texts as if they were OHCOs to explaining those advantages by the hypothesis that
                texts are OHCOs.”<a href="#F21" id="f21" class="footnote"><sup>21</sup></a>
                Interestingly, three of the authors of this paper authored “What Is Text, Really?”
                three years earlier. One of the problems they point out is that the proponents of
                OHCO take a preexisting model of markup procedure, SGML, which was not designed for
                fully describing texts, and attempt to justify its approach by arguing that it is
                practical. This is a problem because they are attempting to answer an ontological
                question, what is text, with a purely pragmatic answer. “What is Text, Really?”
                often fall into this faulty logic. The fact that OHCO can work and that it works
                better than its predecessors are practical observations and have nothing to do with
                the nature of text. The argument that most texts can conform to a hierarchal model
                does not equate to “all texts are ordered hierarchies of content objects.”</p>
            <p> There are other problems with the ontological argument that opponents do not
                acknowledge. “Refining Our Notion of What Text Really Is,” addresses the fact
                that ordered hierarchies are a debatable model, but the article does not question
                the idea that a text is composed of “content objects.” It makes sense that
                formatting would not be considered important for the original purpose of SGML,
                sharing law documents. However, contrary to the OHCO argument, formatting and visual
                presentation can be “essential” elements of a text. An example of the importance of
                presentation in creating meaning can be found in Mark Z. Danielewski’s novel, <i>House
                    of Leaves</i>.<a href="#F22" id="f22" class="footnote"><sup>22</sup></a> Changing
                either the “content objects” or the formatting in <i>House of Leaves</i> fundamentally
                changes the text.</p>
            <p>There are many visual components of <i>House</i> of Leaves that reference the narrative and
                are integral to the experience of reading the text. One such component is the use of
                different fonts. Three separate characters narrate <i>House of Leaves</i>, Johnny Truant,
                Zampano, and the editor, each of which is represented by a different type-font.
                Rather than have the narrators take control of entire chapters, Danielewski
                structured the novel so that each narrator often has a portion of the same chapter.
                If the book is reorganized so that each narrator’s story occurs in sequence the text
                changes even though the component parts are still present. This is because the
                narrators respond to one another and taking them out of context changes the effect
                of the novel. In so doing the self-referential nature of the text is eliminated. By
                having different narrators comment on and add to the text, Danielewski’s novel
                references itself as a physical textual artifact. In this way, the “content objects”
                are essential.</p>
            <p>However, changing the formatting would impact the novel in a similar way. Sometimes
                it is impossible to identify which narrator is speaking by the content alone.
                Eliminating the differences in type-font would make it impossible to parse certain
                parts of the narrative. Although the authors of “What is Text, Really?” claim that
                such a change would not fundamentally alter the text, one could still attempt to
                argue that the formatting of <i>House of Leaves</i> fits into a hierarchal system. Such an
                argument would assume that the fact that the narrative contains three different
                type-fonts is important, but not the type-fonts themselves. This is also wrong; the
                type-fonts were picked intentionally and reference the character with which they are
                associated. For example, Johnny Truant’s text is written in courier. Within the
                narrative Johnny functions as a messenger, delivering the text to the reader.</p>
            <p>There are countless other examples of texts whose visually elements and styling are
                integral parts of the narrative structure and in fact one could argue that this is
                true of all texts. While the assumption that formatting is not “essential” does not
                directly impact markup procedure in digital humanities, the fact that the
                ontological OHCO model operates on this faulty assumption indicates that the
                intended use of OHCO encoding is not inline with its current use.</p>
            <p>The pragmatic argument for OHCO is not dependent on the assumption that text is
                composed of content objects because they are the only “essential” part of a text.
                Instead, this argument focuses on the practical applications of the OHCO model and
                argues that the success of the model means that it accurately reflects the nature of
                text. This approach is harder to argue with. Compared to its predecessors, SGML and
                XML function much more efficiently as text encoding languages.<a href="#F23" id="f23" class="footnote"><sup>23</sup></a> Also, revisions of the OHCO thesis
                suggest a way in which overlapping hierarchies are not at odds with the OHCO model,
                a tempting argument given its practical advantages. In this argument, hierarchies
                that overlap are considered to belong to a different sub-hierarchy: x is a
                sub-perspective of y if and only if x is a perspective and y is a perspective and
                the rules, theories, methods, and practices of x are all included in the rules,
                theories, methods, and practices of y, but not vice versa.<a href="#F24" id="f24" class="footnote"><sup>24</sup></a> By this logic, any overlapping hierarchy can
                be decomposed into sub-perspectives of the text. However, the “rules, theories,
                methods, and practices” mentioned seem completely open to interpretation. By this
                definition it seems as if any perspective could be ruled a sub-perspective of
                another perspective.</p>
            <p>The practical benefits of OHCO combined with this revision might initially seem to
                eradicate doubts about the validity of the model. However, upon a close examination,
                problems still exist. The authors of “Refining our Notion of What Text Is” point out
                that there are cases in which overlapping hierarchies are created by objects that
                self-overlap, or overlap with more of the same type of object. For example, if a
                question overlaps with a line in a poem, it could be argued that questions and lines
                are elements of different perspectives. If, on the other hand, two stories overlap
                with one another, this argument falls apart.</p>
            <p>However, even without contemplating the existence of self-overlapping objects, the
                revision is hard to digest. The creation of sub-perspectives seems ambiguous and
                arbitrary. Even if it is true that overlapping hierarchies are really perspectives
                and sub-perspectives, the coding solutions remain the same. Either perspectives and
                sub-perspectives can be circumnavigated with coding tricks, or, perhaps more inline
                with this revision, different perspectives can be marked up in multiple copies of a
                document. These solutions are not adequate. If there is still no way to represent
                “perspective and sub-perspectives” as coexisting features of the same document, the
                revision is useless.</p>
            <p>Despite these difficulties, ultimately, the practical benefits of OHCO are real.
                While the ontological argument has more obvious flaws, the practical approach is
                grounded in almost ten years of largely successful XML encoding in the humanities.
                However, there is a difference between acknowledging the usefulness of these
                languages, and assuming that their superiority over previous models precludes the
                development of new and better technologies not based on the OHCO model. In light of
                the difficulties posed by overlapping hierarchies, it seems counterproductive that
                both the ontological and pragmatic arguments for OHCO cling to the validity of the
                current markup model.</p>
            <h3><a id="P6" href="#p6" class="title">The Appeal of OHCO</a></h3>
            <p>If there are so many issues with the OHCO argument, where does the inclination to
                treat it as a definitive and infallible model come from? A good insight into this
                question might come from the way that scholars feel about the process of text
                encoding. Though “feel” is hard to measure, Stephen Ramsay, a programmer and digital
                humanist, offers some particularly useful insights. Ramsay refers to the encoding
                process as an act of creation: “As humanists, we are inclined to read maps (to pick
                one example) as texts…But making a map (with a GIS system, say) is an entirely
                different experience… Building is, for us, a new kind of hermeneutic – one that is
                quite a bit more radical than taking the traditional methods of humanistic inquiry
                and applying them to digital objects.”<a href="#F25" id="f25" class="footnote"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
            <p>Comparing encoding to building is particularly useful in that it highlights the
                relationship between the scholar and markup language as that of builder and tool. As
                with most tools, if they get the job done there is no reason to question them. XML
                gets the job done. In addition, the basic syntax of XML makes the language seem
                deceptively open ended. Because the scholar has complete control in determining tag
                names and in determining which textual elements to tag, the limitation of the
                language are not always obvious. Also, current approaches for dealing with
                overlapping hierarchies are very easy to implement, even though they do not fully
                address the problem.</p>
            <p>Another helpful way of thinking about the allure of OHCO might be as follows. For a
                long time people thought CD players were wonderful. Although CD players could not
                play videos, this was not recognized as a “problem” or inadequacy because a video
                playing CD player was unimaginable. Most owners of portable CD players did not stop
                to question the fundamental design properties of the tool they were using to
                listen to music. The people who did stop to consider the fundamental design
                principles of CD players were the engineers making them: people who were intimately
                familiar with the basic principles behind the creation process. Eventually, the iPod
                came out and changed the way people viewed their music players. Engineers were able
                to conceive of a future technological advance because they understood the basic
                design principles behind it and could determine what was feasible.</p>
            <p>Most digital humanists do not fully understand the tools they are using or the
                principles behind them. Nor are the aware of the history of SGML and XML. They know
                that, for the most part, the tools work. Humanities scholars, the people who care
                about the ontological aspects of the markup model, cannot understand how another
                model might exist without better understanding the current system. Thus, many
                scholars fall into the trap of unquestionably accepting the OHCO model. Scholars
                need to be aware of the fact that the tools they are using were not designed for
                them, and that other options are available. This does not mean that scholars should
                disavow the current system. However, in order to improve, there needs to be more
                room for inquiry.</p>
            <h3><a id="P7" href="#p7" class="title">Alternatives and Conclusions</a></h3>
            <p>CONCUR, an alternative to the OHCO approach, was originally a feature of SGML but
                has fallen out of use mainly because it creates cumbersome and verbose markup. It is
                based on the principle of concurrent data structures, a way of dealing with multiple
                threads of data at the same time. CONCUR allows for a document to be simultaneously
                marked up in multiple conflicting hierarchical tag-sets. CONCUR was not included as
                a feature in XML and although some similar languages have been developed, none are
                widely used in humanities markup.<a href="#F26" id="f26" class="footnote"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
            <p>Although there are a number of problems with CONCUR, its basic principle,
                acknowledging and supporting multiple hierarchies simultaneously within a document,
                could be a useful way of dealing with the inadequacies of the current model. In
                addition, the principles behind CONCUR may more adequately reflect the relationship
                between interpretations of a text. It follows that perhaps such a model might also
                allow for a better relationship between the scholar and the markup procedure she is
                using to describe a document.</p>
            <p>However, with that said, it is important not to adopt the same route as the
                proponents of the OHCO model. The fact that CONCUR might more conveniently or
                completely represent certain features of a text does not mean it represents the true
                nature of what text “really is.” CONCUR, like standard SGML and XML, assumes that a
                text is composed of hierarchies. While this assumption is not necessarily wrong,
                emerging markup theories should not assume any principles of previous encoding
                methods as a given and should be discussed critically from the perspective of the
                humanities scholar.</p>
            <p>The “problems” with the current model of textual markup, such as overlapping
                hierarchies, indicate a more fundamental issue with the way text encoding has, for
                the most part, been conceptualized. This is a serious problem because the
                constraints of markup strategies have serious, real world ramifications in the
                relationship between text, scholar, and reader. If scholars must fit a text they
                wish to encode into a hierarchical structure, does this mean that scholars are
                ignoring significant textual relationships that do not conform to the parent, child,
                and sibling model? Because they were not originally intended for literary
                scholarship, SGML and XML cannot be assumed to represent the “true” nature
                of text, nor can they be assumed to be the best languages for describing texts. The
                fact that these markup languages have been used successful does not indicate that there
                is not room for significant improvement. In light of the history and limitations of
                current markup procedure, literary scholars need to reclaim their methods of
                transcription. This might not mean that the OHCO model for text encoding needs to be
                abandoned. However, it is impossible to determine the correct approach to text
                encoding without opening up a larger discussion about what digital humanists want
                and need their markup languages to provide.</p>
