Change in future if people are working in TEI or past projects. -->

        <h3>The texts</h3>
        <p>For this assignment, we set you free to write XSLT on your own project files. Alternatively, you may choose to work with XML files you have discovered and downloaded from <a href="studentProjects.html">the GitHub repos of other newtFire projects</a>.</p>
         <!--   <ul>
                <li>The <a href="http://digitalmitford.org">Digital Mitford</a> project and its full <a href="http://digitalmitford.org/si.xml">Site Index</a>)</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/laurenmcguigan/DecameronProject/blob/master/engDecameronTEIpersName.xml">TEI file in the GitHub repo</a> from <a href="http://decameron.newtfire.org/">the Decameron project</a></li>
                <!-\-<li><a href="http://pacific.pitt.edu">Digital Archives and Pacific Cultures project</a>: look for links to TEI files here.</li>-\->
                <li><a href="https://github.com/RJP43/CitySlaveGirls-ChicagoDailyTimes1888">GitHub repo</a> of the <a href="http://nelson.newtfire.org">City Slave Girls (Nell Nelson) project</a>. </li>
                <li>Other XML file(s) from <a href="studentProjects.html">GitHub repos of other newtFire projects</a></li>
                
            </ul>-->
          <p>Because the XML texts in these projects may still be under development, they may be inconsistently or incompletely marked up. As long as they are well formed, however, you can explore them with XPath-based tools, including XSLT. While you are welcome to use XML files from any of these sources, we will be especially pleased to see you create something interesting from your own project XML files to build new HTML pages for your project website.</p>
        <h3>The assignment</h3>
        <p>Select an XML file from one of the projects and take a few minutes to study it and familiarize yourself with its overall structure. (Notice whether it’s in a namespace and change your stylesheet template accordingly!)
            Visit the project site to learn more about the general project. You may use your own XML
            files or someone else’s. Download an XML file from whichever project you choose into
            &lt;oXygen/&gt;.</p>
        <h3>XSLT Stylesheet setup</h3>
        <p>In Spring 2019, none of the project teams have been coding XML in a namespace like TEI. So if working with 2019 project code, your XSLT stylesheet template just needs to process non-namespaced XML and output code in the HTML namespace. Here is a template for that purpose: </p>
        <pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
      xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
    exclude-result-prefixes="xs"
    <span style="color:blue;">xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"</span>
         version="3.0"&gt;
    
         <span style="color:firebrick;">&lt;xsl:output method="xhtml" encoding="utf-8" doctype-system="about:legacy-compat"
        omit-xml-declaration="yes"/&gt;</span>
    
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;</pre> 
        <h3>Advice in case you need it: Downloading files from GitHub</h3>
        <p>The easiest way to download a file from GitHub is to clone the project onto your own
            machine, which will copy all files, and then open the file you need. If you want to
            download just one file (which is all you need for this assignment), <em>you can’t just
                right-click and download</em> because you’ll download a version with extraneous
            GitHub specific markup mixed into the file, which will render the file unusable for your
            purposes. What you can do instead is:</p>
        <ol>  <li>Connect to the repo in a browser;</li> 
            <li>Click on the file you want, which will display its contents;</li>
            <li>Click on the button labeled <q>Raw</q> at the top of the code window, which will display its contents without
                any extraneous GitHub-specific material; and</li> 
            <li>Either right-click and do a <q>Save as</q> or select all the text in the window, copy it to the clipboard, and paste it
                into a new XML document in &lt;oXygen/&gt;.</li></ol>
        <h3>What to do with the file or collection once you’ve downloaded it</h3>
        <p>Transform the XML into some form of HTML using XSLT, whether that’s a reading view or
            some sorts of lists or tables or other reports. You should decide yourself on the type
            of output you find interesting or useful, but so that you’ll gain practice with
            a range of XSLT techniques, this assignment requires that you make
            meaningful use of <strong>at least two of the following in your XSLT:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Attribute value templates (see <a href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/avt.xhtml">Attribute value templates
                (AVT)</a>)</li>
            <li>Conditional: an <code>&lt;xsl:if&gt;</code> and/or <code>&lt;xsl:choose&gt;</code>
                statement(s) (see <a href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/xslt-basics-2.xhtml">XSLT, part 2: conditionals and push
                    and pull</a>)</li>
            <li>An <code>&lt;xsl:for-each&gt;</code> statement (see <a href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/xslt-basics-2.xhtml"
                >XSLT, part 2: conditionals and push and pull</a>)</li>
            
            <li>Modal XSLT (see <a href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/modal-xslt.html">Modal XSLT</a>)</li>
            <li>Internal linking (see <a href="XSLTExercise6.html">XSLT Exercise 6</a>)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please upload your XSLT and the XML to CourseWeb. You do not have to upload the HTML
            output of your transformation (we’re going to run the transformation and generate the
            HTML ourselves anyway). We recommend that you style your output HTML with CSS, and if you do this, be sure
            that your XSLT generates the necessary <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element inside HTML document, and upload the CSS file along with the XSLT and output HTML.</p>
