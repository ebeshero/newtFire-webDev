      <h1><span class="banner">JavaScript Exercise 3</span></h1>
      <p>In this exercise, we will enhance our output from <a href="SVGExercise2_CDV.html">SVG
            Exercises 2</a> and <a href="SVGExercise3_CDV.html">3</a>, that is, the timeline we
         output in SVG from XQuery on the Digital Mitford letters collection stored in our eXist
         database. At that stage, we output a vertical timeline that ran down the screen and
         required scrolling, and we plotted a parallel line showing how just one correspondent,
         Benjamin Robert Haydon, aligned with the total collection timeline. The parallel line
         marked the earliest and latest letters addressed to him and indicated the stretch of time
         represented by his letters.</p>
      <h2>Our goals</h2>
      <p>Your task is to create a timeline that can sit on a project webpage as a clickable
         infographic that helps us to survey the contents of our collection of files. Our sample
         output looks like this screen capture (but we will refrain from showing you the clickable
         output until you have completed the assignment):</p>
      <img src="screenCapCDVJS3.png" width="1000" />
      <p>As shown in the screen capture image, a clicked checkbox shows or hides a line indicating a
         timespan associated with a particular Mitford correspondent. When a checkbox is clicked,
         this triggers a JavaScript function to fire to check whether a specific SVG
            <code>&lt;g&gt;</code> element, is displaying or hidden.</p>
      <p>To reconstruct our old SVG output into a dynamic webpage involves some alterations to the
         original XQuery we wrote, prior to drafting JavaScript. You will need to do the
         following:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Output an SVG line <em>for each</em> of the correspondents in the collection (not just
            for Benjamin Robert Haydon). <ul>
               <li>Plot the timelines horizontally this time, so the earliest dates are on the left
                  of the screen and the latest on the right.</li>
               <li>Prepare the SVG viewport so the lines do not require scrolling to be viewed.</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>Output a clickable web form in HTML listing each correspondent, and assemble a document
            that successfully integrates HTML with SVG.</li>
         <li>Write CSS and JavaScript so that the SVG timelines for each of Mitford's correspondents
            can be toggled from the HTML portion of the page. Our visitors should be able to show
            and hide particular lines so they can compare the time spans associated with particular
            correspondents on the list. On click of one or more names, we should be able to reveal
            the lines we are interested in seeing.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Help with details</h2>
      <h3>XQuery to output HTML with SVG</h3>
      <p>Optimally, we want to generate our HTML page with SVG set within it, so that the same
         XQuery functions generate the entire page. This is a bit of a challenge for outputting code
         in multiple namespaces. Here is how we did it:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>First, we set up multiple namespaces in our XQuery script. We need to account for three
            namespaces: <ol>
               <li>A default output namespace (which we set to SVG, though you could set it to HTML
                  if you like). The default output namespace one will <strong>not</strong> require
                  prefixes.</li>
               <li>A namespace for the HTML output, with a prefix that we designate.</li>
               <li>A namespace identifying the TEI elements when you are reading them from our
                  collection in eXist-db.</li>
            </ol>
            <p> Note that you can really reverse the default output namespace and make it HTML
               rather than SVG. That is up to you, but whatever output namespace you choose, the
                  <em>other</em> one must be prefixed in your XQuery script. That means that in our
               script, every time we indicate an HTML element, we place an <code>htm:</code> prefix
               in front of it. </p>
            <p>Here is the code we used to define the namespaces as global variables at the top of
               our XQuery script (highlighting the prefix definitions):</p>
            <pre>
               xquery version "3.0";
               declare default element namespace "http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"; 
               declare namespace <code>tei=</code>"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"; 
               declare namespace <code>htm=</code>"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml";</pre>
         </li>
         <li>Unless we noted errors in your original SVG homework, your original global variable
            definitions for the SVG assignment should be fine and will be necessary for this
            assignment, too. We added three new variables to help us identify to <q>dereference</q>
            (or look up) the first standard full name of each correspondent as listed in the Digital
            Mitford site index file, which is posted on the web here: <code><a
                  href="http://digitalmitford.org/si.xml"
               >http://digitalmitford.org/si.xml</a></code>:
            <pre>declare variable $col := collection ('/db/mitford');
                 declare variable $letCol := collection ('/db/mitford/letters');
                       (: other variables here. . . :)
                <code>declare variable $letterRecipients := $letFiles/descendant::tei:titleStmt/tei:title/tei:persName/@ref;
                 declare variable $distLetterRecips := distinct-values($letterRecipients);
                 declare variable $si := doc('http://digitalmitford.org/si.xml');</code></pre>
            Dereferencing isn’t strictly necessary for our assignment, but it is a nice touch for
            display on the Mitford project’s website, where we can use it in our output HTML to list
            a full name rather than just an id value as our list of letter correspondents. Consider
            that a bonus challenge for the assignment: instead of just listing out the @ref values,
            can you output in the HTML a list of the full names of the letter writers? Hint: In our
            code, when we wrote a <code>for loop</code> to step through the distinct
               <code>@ref</code> values, we looked up in the
               <code>http://digitalmitford.org/si.xml</code> file the first
               <code>&lt;tei:persName&gt;</code> child of the <code>&lt;tei:person&gt;</code>
            element whose <code>@xml:id</code> equals the current index variable in the loop. </li>
         <li>Our XQuery needs to output an HTML page, with the SVG timelines tucked inside. You will
            need to build an outer shell of HTML elements around your XQuery script (just as you
            have done in previous assignments in the XQuery series), and within the content of that
            page, we recommend placing an HTML <code>div type="svg"</code> element (with the
            namespace prefix if you prefixed HTML: <code>&lt;htm:div type="svg"&gt;</code>). You can
            apply styling to adjust the dimensions of the div, but you can control the dimensions of
            the SVG viewport so that your timelines will fit on a screen.</li>
         <li>You need to output a list of correspondents to click on in the HTML, and in the SVG you
            need to output a corresponding set of SVG elements. While it would be satisfying to
            output these as the return of the same <code>FLWOR</code>, we found we had to create two
               <code>for loops</code> over the set of distinct values of correspondents in the
            collection, one placed near the top of the HTML page, and the other within the SVG
            portion of the file. Note the following: <ul>
               <li>We used the HTML <code>&lt;htm:input type="checkbox"&gt;</code> element to
                  generate our checkboxes, and we placed an <code>@id</code> attribute on each one.
                  (To read more about HTML checkbox inputs, see <a
                     href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/checkbox"
                     >https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/checkbox</a>
                  ).Our checkbox basically just responds to a mouseclick, and with JavaScript we
                  will make the presence or absence of a check correspond with the display
                  properties of the corresponding SVG line. Note: You do not have to use a checkbox:
                  you could use a <code>htm:button</code> or even an <code>htm:span</code> element
                  that you might stylize in CSS. You simply need for the element to hold an
                     <code>@id</code> attribute that corresponds to each member of your list of
                  distinct values. In order for that <code>@id</code> value to be valid, you will
                  need to remove the hashtag from the front of the string retrieved from the TEI
                     <code>@ref</code> attributes.</li>
               <li>How do we make the SVG lines for each correspondent pair up with the HTML input
                  elements? We set up a <code>for loop</code> to output SVG
                     <code>&lt;line&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;text&gt;</code> elements spaced down
                  the page, and we wrap these in an SVG <code>&lt;g&gt;</code>, on which we place an
                     <code>@id</code> attribute. However, we are not allowed to use the same
                     <code>@id</code> value twice on the same document, so we wrote a short string
                  of prefixing text to distinguish one from the other. (We put <code>SVG_</code> in
                  front of the distinct correspondent value identifying its group of SVG elements,
                  but we could just as easily have put something like <code>HTM_</code> in front of
                  the <code>@id</code> on the HTML input element.)</li>
               <li>How will you space the lines for each correspondent in relation to one another? This is up to you! One approach may be to
               try to plot these all on or near the timeline for the entire collection so that they superimpose on one another (realizing that you will use CSS to hide all the lines at first, and expose them with JavaScript when a visitor selects particular correspondents from the HTML input options. A different approach (the one we took in the version we showed above) is to plot each correspondent line running down the screen. To achieve that, we used the <code>$pos</code> variable in our XQuery <code>for loop</code>: <code>for $i at $pos in $variableWeAreLoopingThrough</code>.</li>
               <li>You may need to review how we calculated the start and end of the Haydon line,
                  and apply this more generally to the <code>for loop</code> values. Remember that
                  the minimum year for a correspondent is something we calculate in relation to the
                  minimum (or maximum) year of the whole collection, but then you ALSO need to
                  multiply that value by 365 so it is properly spaced. (You need to do the same
                  thing with the maximum year value.) Once you have done that, you add the day value
                  to the year value.</li>
               <li>Of course, you will be swapping the x and y values in order to plot horizontally
                  rather than vertically, and you will want to review how we work with
                     <code>transform="translate()"</code>, which we discussed in <a
                     href="SVGExercise5_CDV.html#viewport">SVG Exercise 5</a>.</li>
               <li>Be sure to label your output SVG lines with meaningful information: whose line is
                  this, what’s the start and end date, the count of letters to this correspondent,
                  etc.</li>
            </ul>
         </li>

         <li>Your output file should save with a <code>.html</code> extension. (Interestingly, the
            prefixes from your XQuery script magically disappear when you open the output file and
            view its code!)</li>
         <li>You may want to add the <code>script</code> element signalling your JavaScript file in
            your XQuery script, in case you need to go back and alter the XQuery to correct your
            HTML.</li>
         <li>Your output HTML and SVG will be missing the proper DOCTYPE declaration and the HTML
            root element will be missing its namespace attribute. <strong>Download</strong> the file
            from eXide, save it elsewhere to be mounted on your webspace at the PSC, and
               <strong>open it in &lt;oXygen/&gt;</strong>. You can add what you need by opening a
            new HTML 5 document in &lt;oXygen/&gt; and adding the Doctype line and the namespace
            attribute to the <code>html</code> root element:
            <pre>
               &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
               &lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;</pre>
            &lt;oXygen/&gt; should then give you a green light if all is well. Note: if there are
            hashtags (<code>#</code>) starting your @id attributes, these will raise an HTML
            validation error: you want to avoid outputting those.</li>


      </ul>
      <h3>CSS and JavaScript</h3>
      <p>In your JavaScript you will likely be doing some familiar things you have already tried,
         but you will face new challenges, too. Think about what needs to happen in sequence:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Your CSS may be as elaborate as you like, but it should at the very least be set to
            hide the individual SVG <code>g</code> elements associated with particular correspondent
            timelines. To toggle the display properties off and on involves writing JavaScript to
            show or hide a particular line that the user is clicking on, that is, to change the
            state from hidden to showing. In the CSS we set the default style for the correspondent
            SVG <code>g</code> elements (the ones on which we had set <code>@id</code> attributes) to <code>g[id] {display:none;}</code>. We then wrote a JavaScript
            function to override that and return <code>display="block"</code>, which is the proper
            display value for SVG elements.</li>
         <li>On load of the window, you will want to fire a function, the one we typically call
               <code>init()</code>. That <code>init()</code> or <code>initial(</code>) function
            should add event listeners on the HTML elements that you expect your site visitors to
            interact with. This is familiar territory, but we found ourselves writing the element
            selection a little differently than we have done in the past: In our SVG, we set
               <code>@id</code> attributes on each <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element. We could have
            just used <code>getElementsByTagName()</code>, but we thought we would show you a handy
            selector in JavaScript that uses CSS syntax to identify <em>elements that hold a
               specific attribute</em> called <code>querySelectorAll()</code>: We wrote it like this
            to define an array of elements:
            <pre>
                var inputSelect = document.querySelectorAll('input[id]');</pre>
            That code creates an array of all the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> elements that hold an
               <code>@id</code> attribute. After this we set up a JavaScript for-loop with the range
            variable <code>i</code> to step through each member of the array of
               <code>inputSelect.length</code>, and then we set up our
               <code>addEventListener()</code> to run on the <code>inputSelect[i]</code> (or the
            svgSelect variable at position i), and to fire the next function in sequence in the
            event of <code>'click'</code>, just as you have already done on previous
            assignments.</li>
         <li>Our JavaScript defines just one (or two) more functions to fire after <code>function
               init()</code>.This function needs to check the <code>@id</code> value on the HTML
            element that was clicked on, and to refer to that element, the one the user has just now
            clicked on, we use the special JavaScript word <code>this</code>. To find the
               <code>@id</code> on <code>this</code>, we write: <code>this.id</code>. What you need
            to do with <code>this.id</code> is use it to find the corresponding SVG element whose
               <code>@id</code> best matches. In our code, we added the string <code>SVG_</code>, so
            we sought out the element with the id <code>'SVG_' + this.id</code> to find the matching
            group of SVG elements associated with a particular selected correspondent.</li>
         <li>We then manage the show-hide toggling. You could do this in one or two ways:<ol><li> To do it all in one function, you could write JavaScript <code>if() else()</code>
            to change the display property of the matching SVG element. Remember that to check the
            display condition of <code>this</code>, we need to use the double equal sign:
               <code>==</code>, and use the single equal sign <code>=</code> to indicate a change in
            value.</li>
         <li>The other way, which could be simpler to script, involves two functions. The function that fires on <code>this</code> must <i>first</i> trigger another function that you write to make sure that the SVG elements are ALL hidden, before you trigger <code>this</code> to be visible. This does not require JavaScript to test conditions: it simply turns off the display for a selection as soon as the user visits another selection. We have examples of both approaches on the DHClass-Hub for you to consult.</li>
         </ol></li>

      </ul>
      <h3>What to submit for your homework</h3>
      <p>You will need to submit multiple files to complete this assignment:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Your <strong>XQuery file</strong> that creates your SVG inside HTML. Remember: we
            generally copy our queries into a text file (.txt) for submission.</li>
         <li>Your <strong>HTML file</strong> containing your SVG.</li>
         <li>Your <strong>CSS file</strong> to style and proportion the SVG and HTML elements on
            your page, and to control colors and display options together with your JavaScript</li>
         <li>Your <strong>JavaScript file</strong> to script and control a sequence of events that
            should happen when a visitor interacts with your pages.</li>

      </ul>
      <p>We ask that you associate your files with relative URLs so that you can upload them to
         Courseweb or put them in place (in relation to each other) on whatever web server you wish
         to use. Submit this on Courseweb, but if you like, you may also mount your files on your
         newtFire or GitHub io webspace.</p>
