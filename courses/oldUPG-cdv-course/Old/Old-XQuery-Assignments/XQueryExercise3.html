      <h2>Using XQuery and XSLT Together to Produce KML for Mapping</h2>
      	
      <!--	<img src="keyhole.png" alt="keyhole image"/>-->
      		
      <p>With this exercise, you will gain experience with extracting data from multiple files,
         and with processing it in multiple stages of transformation, a kind of “pipeline”
         or chain of files we’ll create in both XQuery and XSLT. You’ll also gain experience
         with producing <strong>KML (Keyhole Markup Language)</strong> to view in Google Earth or Google Maps. KML was developed as a form of XML to store
         and process location information with geospatial coordinates for visualization, and
         its odd name, “Keyhole,” is an homage to the early 1960s Key Hole spy satellites (so
         named because they were being used to see into secret areas during the Cold War, like
         peering furtively through a keyhole into a private room). Our view of the Google Earth
         globe and the extensive zooming and panning visibility available in Google Maps is
         reliant on satellite imaging technology that allows us to pan back from a distance
         to view continents or pull up close to a 3-dimensional street view.

      <h3>Anatomy of a KML file:</h3>
      		
      <p>A KML file has the following basic structure. (There are many more elements that you
         may use, but for our purposes this is just a simple form of the file thanks to <a href="https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kml_tut">the Google Developers KML Documentation Tutorial</a> with some small adjustments, and represents the bare minimum to work with):
      </p>
      		
      <div class="code">
         			&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;<br />
         			&lt;kml xmlns="http://earth.google.com/kml/2.2"&gt;<br />
         			&lt;Placemark&gt;<br />
         			&lt;name&gt;Simple placemark&lt;/name&gt;<br />
         			<span class="indent">&lt;description&gt;Attached to the ground. Intelligently places itself 
            				at the height of the underlying terrain.&lt;/description&gt;</span><br />
         			<span class="indentMore">&lt;Point&gt;</span><br />
         			<span class="indentEvMore">&lt;coordinates&gt;-122.0822035425683,37.42228990140251,0&lt;/coordinates&gt;</span><br />
         			<span class="indentMore">&lt;/Point&gt;</span><br />
         			&lt;/Placemark&gt;<br />
         			&lt;/kml&gt;
         		
      </div>
      		
      <p>There are a couple of available namespace definitions for KML: One is the Google namespace
         we indicate here and use in this assignment. The other is the default actually listed
         in the Google Developers’ tutorial pages and that currently is set in &lt;oXygen/&gt; when
         you open a new KML file (look in New → Framework Templates): That namespace is <span class="code">&lt;kml xmlns="http://www.opengis.net/kml/2.2"&gt; </span>, and while it’s fine to use that in your projects, for our purposes we are using
         the Google namespace for consistency with the GPS lookup tool we are using in this
         exercise. When working with generating your own KML and coordinating with a lookup
         service as we are doing here, it is important to <strong>keep an eye on namespace consistency</strong> given the multiple namespaces available.
      </p>
      			
      <h3>Overview of the assignment:</h3>
      			
      <ol>
         				
         <li>First, we need to extract the distinct locations tagged in a batch of XML project
            files. We have uploaded for this purpose a collection of files from this semester's
            Church Schism project into eXist, accessible from <span class="code">collection('/db/Schism')/*</span>. We will extract all the distinct values of the element <span class="code">&lt;location&gt;</span> in use in these files, and we need to generate our output in a string-joined list
            with a line-break separator, so each name appears on a separate line in our plain
            text output.  
            				
         </li>
         				
         <li>We need the data in this format to input into a web form at <strong>GPS VIsualizer</strong>: <a href="http://www.gpsvisualizer.com/geocoder/">http://www.gpsvisualizer.com/geocoder/</a>, which will look up and output latitude and longitude coordinate data for each line
            of text. You will need to use a map API key to process more than five locations at
            a time, and for our class purposes we have set up a key to Bing Maps API that you
            may use (copy the full line below): 
            					
            <div class="code">AlmOJ6eCoH-qzIkqle1JVPo1O8FHE4IANZ0mxTB0tga19_AuZQec5ynrhFUZmjol</div>
            				<span class="smaller">The keys to Bing, Open Maps, and Google Maps permit individuals to process info for
               some hundreds or perhaps a thousand places per day, and are a sort of filter to prevent
               abuse and overload of map APIs. You may wish to sign up for your own Basic key for
               use in your projects. </span>
            				
         </li>
         				
         <li>We can output a KML file from the GPS Visualizer site, and save it to work with it.
            We will make some changes to it so that it includes more information that we will
            extract via XQuery from the Church Schism project files. For this assignment, we would
            like to capture the text of the paragraphs surrounding each location, so that this
            text appears in place marks on our maps.
         </li>
         				
         <li>We return to XQuery to output a file we will call <strong>Placeography.kml</strong>, which follows a very simple structure of a KML document: just location names and
            descriptions. so you will output the distinct-values of <span class="code">&lt;location&gt;</span> again, followed by the <strong>first paragraph</strong> in the project files that holds this location information. (We can’t easily accommodate
            all the paragraphs that hold this place name, so for our purposes, we’ll simplify
            matters and just return only the first paragraph that introduces the location.)  It
            will have the following structure (including sample output here):
            				
            <div class="code">
               					&lt;kml&gt;<br />
               					<span class="indent">&lt;Placemark&gt;</span><br />
               					<span class="indentMore">&lt;name&gt;Allegheny County&lt;/name&gt;</span><br />
               					<span class="indentMore">&lt;description&gt;An Allegheny County court awarded the Episcopal Diocese of Pittsburgh
                  more than $15 million in endowments, bank accounts and other assets that a secessionist
                  diocese had sought to retain.
                  								of the Court of Common Pleas in Allegheny County ruled yesterday that the
                  assets -- although not necessarily buildings and land titled in the name of the parishes
                  that seceded -- belong to the  Diocese of Pittsburgh of the  Church of the United
                  States of America. Due to the litigation, the financial services firm  froze diocesan
                  trust funds pending a decision by an Allegheny County Common Pleas judge. The 600-member
                  Church of the Ascension was denied more than $30,000 in promised grants, most of which
                  were intended to start a mission church.
                  								&lt;/description&gt;</span><br />
               					<span class="indent">&lt;/Placemark&gt;</span><br />
               					&lt;/kml&gt;
               					
               				
            </div>
            					For the purposes of this homework exercise, when you output this KML file, <strong>name it Placeography.kml</strong> (just for ease of reference to this assignment page). In your projects you may want
            to handle your data extraction differently than we do here (not necessarily outputting
            whole paragraphs, but perhaps other kinds of information correlated to the locations
            you want to plot on a map). In any case, you will want to think about what kinds of
            information you want to feature in the KML <span class="code">description</span> element.	
            				
         </li>
         				
         <li>Now, we turn to &lt;oXygen/&gt; to write XSLT. We have some automatically generated KML
            that contains information we need to plot our maps, and we have a simple Placeography.kml.
            We are going to write an <strong>identity transformation</strong> stylesheet that will pull the two files together. We will show you how to do that
            below. 
         </li>
         				
         <li>We output our KML file from this identity transformation, save it and open it in &lt;oXygen/&gt;
            to be sure it is well-formed and valid. Then we input it into either Google Earth
            (if you have installed it on your computer or access it on our computer lab machines),
            or into Google Maps (for which you will need to access your Google account). To import
            a KML file into Google Earth, <a href=" http://www.igismap.com/upload-kml-file-google-map/">follow these instructions</a>. Here is <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=zInhk3q5XEGA.k4w5KlEZWuPU">a view of sample output from this assignment: what this should look like when you're
               done</a>.  
         </li>
         				
         			
      </ol>
      		
      		
      <h3>Help with the details:</h3>
      		
      <ol>
         			
         <li>The first task, to output plain text with distinct location names simply involves
            using <span class="code">distinct-values()</span> in a way that you’ve done before. (To be sure that you are getting the correct results,
            if you do a count() of all the distinct location names coded as of now in the Schism
            project files, the number should be 46.) But there’s something unusual in this task
            that you’ve not seen before: We want to output a new location on each line of plain
            text output, using the <span class="code">string-join()</span> function. Usually when we use <span class="code">string-join()</span>, we indicate a comma or some form of punctuation as our separator character for the
            second argument of the function. This time, we’re using a special ASCII character
            code for a <strong>line feed:</strong> <span class="code">&amp;#10;</span> . Position this in your string-join() (using quotation marks) just as you would any
            other separator character. <span class="smaller">(Or you could define it as a variable in XQuery, and then when you call the variable
               inside <span class="code">string-join()</span>, don’t use the quotation marks.)</span> <strong>Copy this XQuery into a text file to save, as one of the files you will upload to
               Courseweb for this homework assignment.</strong></li>
         			
         <li>For the second task, highlight and copy all your output from the eXide returns window,
            and paste your list of location names into <a href="http://www.gpsvisualizer.com/geocoder/">the GPS Visualizer tool</a> (after inputting the Bing Maps Key), be sure you have selected Bing Maps as your
            source (so you can use my key) and click the green “Start geocoding” button. Wait
            for the results to come out in the text window: You will see lists of latitude and
            longitude pairs followed by place names and other information.
         </li> 
         <li>
            				We would like to output this information as a KML document that we can transform
            for ourselves in &lt;oXygen/&gt;. To do that, click on the link to the right of the output
            box labelled in green in square brackets: <strong>[more map options]</strong>.
            <ul>
               				
               <li>This brings up a page titled <strong>“Convert your GPS data for use in Google Earth.”</strong> In the “General map parameters” area, <strong>change the Output file type</strong> on the dropdown menu from the default .kmz (zipped) to the form we want: <strong>.kml (uncompressed)</strong>. Notice that you can make adjustments here to your output data. The KML file you
                  create will be something you can import into Google Earth or Google Maps or other
                  mapping software if you would like to see what you have produced so far. As you learn
                  more about how to fine-tune your KML output and control the look of your maps in mapping
                  software, you may find you want to make some adjustments on this screen to your output,
                  or code other things yourself working in &lt;oXygen/&gt;. (Feel free to tinker with the
                  default icon and icon color, etc.)
               </li>
               				
               <li>When you are ready, click the button in the lower right of your screen: “Create KML
                  file.” You will see a file is generated with a long name (beginning with today’s date)
                  and a .kml extension. Click to download and save the file in a folder into which you
                  will save other files related to this mapping assignment. (You will need to save your
                  XSLT in this folder, as well as one other KML file you are about to produce. It is
                  important that all of these files are sitting in the same directory in relation to
                  each other, for us to process them together.)
               </li>
               				
            </ul>
            			
         </li>
         			
         			
         <li>You have produced one KML file, or rather you have let the GPS Visualizer do it for
            you. Now, we want to create a very simple KML file of our own. Go back into eXist,
            and this time, write a new XQuery file (building on the previous XQuery that you wrote,
            if you like). This time, we need to output a file that contains KML’s structure of
            &lt;placeMark&gt; elements, with two elements inside: a &lt;name&gt; element and a &lt;description&gt;
            element. You have learned to write XQuery to output HTML, with a root element at the
            top and bottom, and curly braces <strong>{ }</strong> to set off the XQuery FLWOR statements and their itemized output. This time, you
            need to produce <span class="code">kml</span> output, which is much simpler than HTML. Create a root element at the top of your
            file: <span class="code">&lt;kml&gt;</span>, and close it at the end of your file: <span class="code">&lt;/kml&gt;</span>. In between, set up your curly braces <span class="code">{ }</span>, and write a FLWOR with a <span class="code">return</span> statement in this form:
            				
            <div class="code">
               					&lt;kml&gt;<br />
               					<strong>{</strong><br />
               					(: FLWOR  statements  :)<br />
               					
               					return<br />
               					
               					<span class="indent">&lt;Placemark&gt;</span><br />
               					<span class="indentMore">&lt;name&gt;{&lt;!--something here to process in XQuery!--&gt; }&lt;/name&gt;</span><br />
               					<span class="indentMore">&lt;description&gt;{&lt;!--something here to process in XQuery!--&gt;}
                  						&lt;/description&gt;</span><br />
               					<span class="indent">&lt;/Placemark&gt;</span><br />
               					<strong>}</strong><br />
               					&lt;/kml&gt;
               					
               				
            </div>
            			
            <ul>
               <li>Your FLWOR statement will need to output, in the kml <span class="code">name</span> element, <strong>each one of the <span class="code">distinct-values()</span> of the <span class="code">location</span> element</strong> (using that range variable you worked with in the previous XQuery Exercise 2). 
               </li>
               				
               <li>In the <span class="code">description</span> element you need to define a variable that will look up for *each* of the location
                  names in that distinct-values list (using that range variable still), the <strong>very first paragraph</strong> (coded as <span class="code">&lt;p&gt;</span> in the XML files of the Schism collection. Return the <span class="code">string()</span> value of that paragraph so we don't bother with its tags: we just want its plain
                  text.
               </li>
               <li> When you are generating output that makes sense, <strong>copy and paste your XQuery into a text file with something new in the title (like
                     Beshero-Schism-pt2) and save it to upload to Courseweb </strong>as part of this homework assignment. Also, you now need to copy and paste that code
                  into a new KML file in &lt;oXygen/&gt;: To do this, in &lt;oXygen/&gt; go to New, and look in
                  the Framework Templates folder for the KML folder. Open the file, and change its top
                  line, because it will be pointing a different KML namespace than the files we are
                  generating. Delete the top namespace line and replace it with the following:
                  					
                  <div class="code">&lt;kml xmlns="http://earth.google.com/kml/2.2"&gt;</div>
                  				Now, paste into this new file, after the new namespace line, the KML output you
                  generated in eXide, making sure you have included your root element. <span class="smaller">(When you paste you might leave in the default kml root element, so it's easy to accidentally
                     double these, and an easy problem to fix.)</span> Save your new KML file (for the purposes of our assignment) as <strong>Placeography.kml</strong> in the same folder with the KML file you generated with the GPS Visualizer.
               </li>
               			
            </ul>
            			
         </li>
         			
         <li>Now, you have made not one, but two KML files! We want to take that <span class="code">description</span> element you generated, with the <span class="code">p[1]</span> output and merge it with the KML file that you generated from the GPS Visualizer.
            We will do that using XSLT to write an <strong>Identity Transformation</strong> stylesheet. You will be transforming the GPS Visualizer KML into a new and slightly
            modified KML, that draws from your second KML file. This will introduce you to some
            coding in XSLT that you have not seen before, a kind of coding that resembles what
            we do with drawing on multiple files in XQuery. In XSLT, too, you can work with multiple
            files. Because this is new and unusual, we want to show you how it works, so we give
            you our code with comments. (Here are links to: 
            <ul>
               <li><a href="KML-IDTransform.xsl">our KML to KML Identity Transformation XSLT file</a>, so you can download the file and open it in &lt;oXygen/&gt;, and

               <li><a href="KMLtoKMLExplainbw.pdf">a printable PDF document copy</a> of the code, with our comments highlighted.)
               </li>
               			
            </ul>  We hope that you will be able to apply this in your files.

                  						&lt;!--ebb: Note that we need to add an XPath default namespace for KML (for input)
                  and an xmlns for the output KML, too. All files we're processing need to be in KML
                  format: note the two separate declarations of KML in the &lt;xsl:stylesheet&gt; element.
                  (The output method has to be xml because there's no recognized "kml" value for the
                  @method on xsl:output.)

               				<span class="smaller">&lt;!--ebb: This variable actually invokes a second document that we're going to pull
                  into this transformation! We will be able to process and mingle information from more
                  than one file by establishing variables like this, set at the document node (or root
                  element) of the file. We'll invoke it below using $PO. --&gt;</span><br />
               				&lt;xsl:template match="node() | @*"&gt;<br />
               				<span class="indent">&lt;xsl:copy&gt;</span><br />

               				&lt;/xsl:template&gt;<br />
               				<span class="smaller">&lt;!--ebb: This code (above) matches and copies all the elements of the KML file, and
                  essentially makes this an Identity Transformation stylesheet.--&gt;</span><br /><br />
               				&lt;xsl:template match="description"&gt;<br />
               				<span class="indent">&lt;name&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select="."/&gt;&lt;/name&gt;</span><br />
               				&lt;/xsl:template&gt;<br />
               					<span class="smaller">&lt;!--ebb: In the initial output from GPS Visualizer, we discover that the contents
                  of the &lt;description&gt; element contains a little more detail than the original value
                  we input for &lt;name&gt;. So we write a template rule to match on &lt;description&gt; and output
                  it as &lt;name&gt;, and we'll suppress the original &lt;name&gt; element from appearing in the
                  output with the next template rule. --&gt;</span><br />
               					
               					
               					&lt;xsl:template match="Placemark/name"&gt;<br />
               						
               				<span class="indent">&lt;description&gt;</span>  <br />
               				<strong><span class="indentMore">&lt;xsl:value-of select="$PO//name[. = current()]/following-sibling::description"/&gt;</span><br /></strong>
               				<span class="indent">&lt;/description&gt;</span><br />
               						
               						&lt;/xsl:template&gt;<br />
               					
               				<span class="smaller">&lt;!--ebb: Initially we wrote this:<br />
                  				&lt;xsl:template match="name"&gt;<br />
                  				&lt;/xsl:template&gt;<br />
                  That line is basically an empty template match, so it matches on name and makes it
                  so nothing comes out.
                  But we decided we wanted to add a new &lt;description&gt; element, pulling from Cassie's
                  and Ryan's XML markup, to collect the text immediately surrounding the location name.
                  So with this template rule we're invoking a second file, signalled by the variable
                  $PO which we defined at the top of our XSLT document. Note that we are establishing
                  a match-up here between the two files, so we need to use both dot (.) and current()
                  to be very precise about our match-up: The dot (.) refers to *wherever you are at
                  the moment in your current path* so it's in-the-moment, here, referring to the most
                  immediate reference point: the $PO//name. We need current() to signal where we are
                  with the template match, the current context node of the template match in our main
                  import file from the GPS Visualizer.

      <p>To learn more about how to work with KML and its many options for laying out and connecting
         points, drawing shapes on maps, using image overlays, etc., see the <a href="https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kml_tut">Google Developers KML Tutorial</a>. There are a few options for <a href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/kml-gadget.html">embedding Google Earth</a> or Google Maps on a website using iframes (for Google Maps, find the embed link on
         the webpage). We’ll help you with this, but first spend some time looking at map output
         in various views and decide what views make the most sense for your project.
