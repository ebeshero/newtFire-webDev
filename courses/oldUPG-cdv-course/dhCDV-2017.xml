            <head>Coding and Data Visualization: Course Description</head>
            <p>This course is all about doing interesting things with texts using computers and
                digital technology. In this course, you will learn methods for marking, extracting, and analyzing data from digital documents to produce visualizations such as graphs, charts, diagrams, maps, which you will design in the context of real projects. This course is meant to be complementary with the <ref target="CDA.html">Coding and Digital Archives course</ref>, but where the emphasis in that course is on curating and preparing reading views of documents, this course concentrates on analyzing data to produce informational graphics.</p>
             <p>Our class is one of the core courses of <ref target="http://greensburg.pitt.edu/academics/info/digital-studies">Pitt-Greensburg’s Digital Studies Certificate</ref>, and it satisifes a range of
                 general education requirements in quantitative reasoning,
                 behavioral sciences, and humanities. That is because this course is distinctively
                 interdisciplinary in engaging formal and
                 quantitative reasoning through computer coding in ways that matter to students in
                 humanities and social sciences who are not training to be computer scientists.
                 Students gain hands-on experience in this course with applying computer coding to
                 represent and investigate cultural materials. As we design projects together, you
                 will gain practical experience in editing and you will certainly fine-tune your
                 precision in writing and thinking.  We will do all of this with
                 an eye to your understanding how coding works in an openly collaborative environment, with an emphasis on building sustainable and freely accessible resources on the public web.</p>
             
             <p>Students who complete this course will gain skills in digital project management and
                 web development, and their digital projects will distinguish them as investigators
                 and makers, able to wield computers creatively and effectively for human interests.
                 Your success will require patience, dedication, and regular communication and
                 interaction with us, working through assignments on a daily basis. Your success will
                 <hi>not</hi> require perfection, but rather your regular efforts throughout the course, your
                 documenting of problems when your coding doesn’t yield the results you want. Homework
                 exercises are a back-and-forth, intensive dialogue between you and your instructors,
                 and we plan to spend a great deal of time with you individually over these as we work
                 together. Our guiding principle in developing assignments and working with you is
                 that the best way for you to learn and succeed is through regular practice as you
                 hone your skills. Our goal is not to make you expert programmers (as we are far from
                 that ourselves). Instead, we want you to learn how to apply coding technologies for
                 your own purposes, how to track down answers to questions, how to think your way
                 algorithmically (step-by-step) through problems to find good solutions.</p>
         
         </div>
          <div type="description" style="main"><head>Survey of Coding Technologies Covered:</head>
              <p> We will be working primarily with eXtensible Markup Language (XML) because it is a
                  powerful tool for modelling texts that we can adapt creatively to our interests and
                  questions. XML represents a standard in adaptability and human-readability in digital
                  code, and it works together with related technologies with which you will gain
                  working experience: You’ll learn how to write XPath expressions: a formal language
                  for searching and extracting information from XML code which serves as the basis for
                  transforming XML into many publishable forms. You’ll learn to
                  write XSLT: a programming “stylesheet” transforming language designed to convert XML
                  to publishable formats. In this course, you will also learn XQuery, an XPath-based language designed to query XML as a database, and we will use XQuery to extract information and plot it in charts in graphs in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). You will learn how to
                  design your own systematic coding methods to work on projects, and how to write your
                  own rules in schema languages (like Schematron and Relax-NG) to keep your projects
                  organized and prevent errors. Since one
                  of the best and most widely accessible ways to publish XML is on the worldwide web,
                  you’ll gain working experience with HTML code (a markup language that is a kind of
                  XML), styling HTML with Cascading Stylesheets (CSS), and adding dynamic features to your website with JavaScript.</p>

                  Each day will involve some small assignment, building to the larger course
                  projects. Students must complete (on time) at least 90% of each homework component
                  (coding assignments, short response papers, blog postings and responses, in order
                  to pass the course. For students who complete the 90% requirement, the homework

                     <hi rend="em">Coding assignments:</hi> These are assignments you’ll complete by
                     writing code to achieve a specified result by applying a coding method you are
                     learning. Often, there will be multiple ways of accomplishing the task. You
                     will receive lots of feedback from us, in the form of posted results and
                     individual commentary on your assignments as needed. If you don’t achieve the
                     result you want, you may still receive full credit so long as you have made a
                     serious attempt to describe your process, what else you tried, what results you
                     expected vs. what results you got, and what you think went wrong. Documenting
                     problems is key to the learning process, and sometimes the documentation
                     process helps lead you to the solution and always helps your learning

               <head>Participation: In Class and on the DH-ClassHub (15%):</head>
               <p> Coding and programming in real life is a social activity, and professionals in
                  the real world aren’t "know-it-all" experts who work alone, but rather are tuned
                  into discussion boards and regularly ask and answer questions to stay sharp and to
                  learn from their community. In this class, we want you to work together and talk
                  to each other and your instructors as your community resource, so we have built
                  this into our course participation grade as a formal expectation. <hi rend="em">Beginning by week two, we’ll expect each student to post at least once per
                     week on our online class discussion board</hi>, and we strongly encourage you
                  to do more than this minimum. Ask questions, make suggestions, share helpful
                  resources you’ve found. Help each other out by trying to answer questions (and
                  read the instructor posts too as we wade in to help). Your instructors will likely
                  be dominating the class time as we model concepts and methods, so the discussion
                  boards give you all a good space to form into a coding community to help each
                  other and reflect together. Also, if you have a question about an assignment, <hi rend="em">always think of the discussion board as your first resource</hi> to
                  check for helpful hints and to post your questions, because others may have the
                  same question and answers are best shared! Of course you may e-mail us, but we
                  really prefer you go the discussion board first, and doing so is, after all, worth

                  eight) short quizzes and tests that will take roughly half of the class period

               <p> Within the first three weeks of the course, we will familiarize you with some of
                  our ongoing projects and their associated research questions. These include the

                     variants in Emily Dickinson’s Fascicle 16</ref>. You will be working in teams
                  to contribute to these ongoing projects, to develop a site of your own designed to
                  enhance these projects or take them in a new direction. The direction you take
                  will be partly shaped by you in conversation with the instructors.
                  <!--We will also assign you to
                  propose a project based on a text or set of texts that interest you and suggest a
                  promising research question to explore with our coding methods, and we’ll respond
                  to these to help you refine your ideas. We’ll ask you all to read each other’s
                  refined proposals, and the class as a whole (working with the instructors) will
                  select which of these we want to pursue through the term, and form groups to begin
                  work.-->
                  Development of the project will involve doing a careful document analysis,
                  developing a coding plan and rules to follow, coding your text(s), and developing
                  programs to address your research question. It will also involve designing a
                  project site to represent your research questions, the texts and your processing
                  of them, as well as to share your coding scripts and to reflect on the results of
                  your investigation. We will post milestones you must meet for the projects
                  throughout the term. Project teams must meet 90% of the project milestone due
                  dates in order to receive a passing grade. It is expected that project teams meet
                  regularly (each week), check in with the instructors, and delegate tasks to each
                  other. Reporting on project progress is required as part of the regular homework
                  assignments for the course. Teams are encouraged to meet with us instructors
                  during (or outside) our scheduled office hours. In the last few weeks of the
                  course, almost all of your course work outside class will be devoted to project
                  development, applying the methods you’ve been learning across the semester.</p>

                  absence: +3 pts; Two absences: +2 pts; Three or more: +0 pts. To earn credit, you
                  must be present in the classroom by the beginning of class, until class is
                  dismissed. For your own sanity, do not miss two consecutive classes. If you are
                  experiencing a genuine emergency or crisis, alert us and provide documentation.
                  (We do not want you to attend class if you have a fever or flu-like symptoms! If
                  you wish to be excused from two or more consecutive class meetings due to your own
                  documented illness, please contact one of the following: the Office of the Vice

               <p> Your daily homework for this course is time-sensitive! Coding assignments,
                  response papers, and other homework exercises must be uploaded to CourseWeb (or to
                  Box, or the Sandbox server as specified), by the date and time indicated by the
                  instructors. Homework assignments will be posted online to our class DHDS website
                  and linked from our schedule, so students who miss class are nevertheless expected
                  to consult the schedule and submit assignments on time. Because we post and share
                  answers to homework exercises after submission deadlines, we will not accept late
                  homework submissions. In order to pass the course, students must submit at least
                  90% of the regular homework assignments, and complete at least 90% of the work in
                  each component of the course.</p>

               <p>Our class is fast paced, and requires that we all be making the best use we can of
                  our in-person class sessions. Arriving late and leaving early disrupts the
                  important collective mental activity of class. So does in-class texting and
                  checking your cell phone. While class is in progress, talking disruptively,
                  leaving the classroom, texting or using a cell phone or computer, reading a
                  newspaper, or other distracting behavior will be actively discouraged, and may
                  result in a deduction in your Participation grade. Please respect what we do in
                  the classroom: attend class regularly, and come prepared to contribute your

               <p>Each student is issued a University email address (username@pitt.edu) upon
                  admission. This email address may be used by the University for official
                  communication with students. Students are expected to read email sent to this
                  account on a regular basis. Failure to read and react to University communications
                  in a timely manner does not absolve the student from knowing and complying with
                  the content of the communications. The University provides an email forwarding
                  service that allows students to read their email via other service providers
                  (e.g., Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo). Students who choose to forward their email from their
                  pitt.edu address to another address do so at their own risk. If email is lost as a
                  result of forwarding, it does not absolve the student from responding to official
                  communications sent to their University email address. To forward email sent to
                  your University account, go to http://accounts.pitt.edu, log into your account,
                  click on Edit Forwarding Addresses, and follow the instructions on the page. Be

                  <hi rend="em">Source Citation and Plagiarism:</hi> One goal of our course is to
                  reflect on how best to cite sources in digital contexts. We will consider how and
                  why such citations differ from documenting printed texts. We will also consider
                  the ease and frequency with which digital texts and graphics are plagiarized on
                  the worldwide web, and discuss how the omission of source citations detracts from
                  the authority of a digital information resource. We expect you to practice mindful
                  source citation, and plagiarism on your part will have very serious
                  consequences.</p>
               <p>Plagiarism falsely represents another source’s words or ideas as your own, and, if
                  you commit plagiarism in this course, you will receive a final course grade of F
                  and be reported to the Vice President of Academic Affairs. Representing the voice
                  of another individual as your own voice constitutes plagiarism, however generous
                  that person may be in “helping” you with an assignment. Turning in an assignment
                  generated collectively under the name of a single individual is considered
                  plagiarism. <hi rend="em">When instructed to collaborate on a project, project
                     collaborators share collective authorship and should identify themselves
                     directly as a team.</hi> To avoid plagiarism, cite your sources whenever you
                  quote, paraphrase, or summarize material, or use digital images from any outside
                  source (including websites, articles, books, course readings, Courseweb postings,
                  or someone else’s notes). When using the “copy” and “paste” features as you read
                  and research, be sure that you are carefully marking that these passages are
                  unprocessed from their source, so that you know to process it later. Forgetting to
                  do so not only produces sloppy work but (whether you intended it or not) results
                  in a false representation. As long as you make a good faith and clear effort to
                  cite your sources, you will not be faulted for plagiarism, but your work will be
                  penalized if citations are inaccurate, unclear, or lack important information.
                  Cheating on exams or exercises will also receive a final course grade of F and
                  will be reported to the Vice President of Academic Affairs.</p>

                            ideas for team projects to work on this semester. Each student
                            should post an idea for the class to consider: a project involving
                            XML markup to be managed within a team of 2-4 students to
                            investigate something we could study and visualize from our markup
                            more effectively with computers than with human reading and
                            description alone. All projects must involve a team of at least two
                            persons, but this first exploratory proposal is an individual
                            assignment.</item>
                        <item>Each of you must respond to at least one of the proposed ideas
                            from another student and indicate suggestions or further ideas. You
                            may respond to more than one if you like, and indicate which
                            proposals interest you to work on. </item>
                        <item>Proposal discussions will run through next week, until class time on Friday 1/29 when we will form project teams.</item>
