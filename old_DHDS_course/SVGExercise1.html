				<p>Your homework exercise is to draw a bar graph "by hand" in SVG to compare the sizes of three Pacific islands. (And since we're thinking about Pacific islands, just for fun we've found an SVG map of Tahiti and Mo'orea to illustrate this page: Try resizing your browser window and watch as the map scales up and down!)</p>
			<p>Here's the data you need to graph--<b>the areas in square miles of three Polynesian islands:</b> 
				</p><div id="outline">
					<ul>
						<li>Tahiti 404 sq mi; </li>
					<li>Raiatea 65 sq mi; </li>
					<li>Tongatapu 100 sq mi</li></ul>
				</div>
			<div id="explan">
				<img src="TahitiMoorea.svg" alt="SVG map of Tahiti and Mo'orea islands" width="75%" height="75%"/>
			</div>
			<p><b>Here's what you need to do:</b></p>
			<ol><li>Make a bar graph that has an x axis and a y axis, using the SVG <span class="code">:&lt;line&gt;</span> element.</li>
				<li>Now, make three bars of different colors using the SVG <span class="code">&lt;rect&gt;</span> element. Experiment with size and scale of your bars for viewing on a web browser!</li> 
				<li>Finally, use the SVG <span class="code">&lt;text&gt;</span> element to put labels on the axes or the bars to indicate the island names and the numerical values. Position text across the top to give your graph a title that indicates what we're seeing: the relative size in square miles of three Pacific islands.</li></ol>
			<p><a href="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/svg/text-element.html">Read about how to work with the SVG <span class="code">&lt;text&gt;</span></a> element, orienting text direction, setting font size, etc. For example, try making vertical text, and adjusting the spacing between letters. (Overall, we really like this site, <a href="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/svg/index.html">Jakob Jenkov's tutorial on SVG</a>, as it seems better organized and more informative than <a href="http://w3schools.com/svg/default.asp">the one at w3schools</a>--but feel free to explore both!)</p>

			
			<h3>The Weirdness of the Y-Axis in SVG coordinate space</h3>
			
			<p>Remember, as we saw in class, in SVG the y-axis is upside-down! Low y-values close to zero sit near the top, and as y values increase, we move <b>down</b> the screen. This means that if you draw your chart using positive y values, the way you'd draw it on a sheet on graph paper, the bars will grow downwards instead of upwards, and their baseline will be at the top, not the bottom.</p>
			
			<p>If you want to draw a vertical bar graph the usual way with the bottom along an x-axis, here's a way you can do it: Say you want to graph two bars, one with a height of 25 and the other with a height of 50. Make rectangles with heights of 25 and 50, but set the shorter bar at a y position that's 25 units MORE than the longer one. Try making your baseline be at 50, and run your long bar UP THE SCREEN to 0. Then make your short bar go from 50 up to 25. (This may be easier to visualize by drawing it on a piece of paper with a pencil, and labelling the values, realizing you've got to deal with the y-axis backwards.</p> 
			
			<p>We'll eventually be handling this y-axis weirdness in other ways as we make SVG from XQuery, but for this exercise, just to learn your way around SVG, we'd like you to "hand-code" your graph this way. </p>
