            <h3>Preliminaries</h3>
            <p>Before beginning this assignment please thoroughly read our tutorial: <q><a
                        href="http://www.newtfire.org/dh/explainGitShell.html" target="_blank">Guide
                        to Git Shell: Git and GitHub at Command Line</a></q>. It will benefit you to
                keep this tutorial open while you work on this assignment. Also, you should complete
                this assignment on a computer you will likely be using the most this semester,
                because you will be configuring it to get it working routinely with Git and GitHub
                and navigating your own file directories. (You can always set up Git on other
                computers when you need to and access GitHub wherever you are.)</p>

            <h3>Analysis of the task</h3>
            <p>The goals of this assignment are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Create a GitHub account.</li>
                <li>Download Git and set up GitHub on a local computer.</li>
                <li>Clone and navigate locally our <a target="_blank"
                        href="https://github.com/ebeshero/DHClass-Hub">DHClass-Hub</a>
                    repository.</li>
                <li>Create a personal remote repository on GitHub via website, and make a local clone.</li>
                <li>Add a file to a repository using Git and push it to your remote repository.</li>
                <li>Comment and/or create an Issue on GitHub.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Upon completion of this assignment you should feel confident about <dfn>pushing</dfn>
                and <dfn>pulling</dfn> files using Git and interacting on GitHub. Our courses
                require weekly, even daily, Git activity; therefore, if you still feel uncertain on
                how to use Git or GitHub after completing this assignment please meet with an
                instructor. We will gladly assist you so that you feel comfortable using Git and
                GitHub on a regular basis.</p>

        </section>
        <section title="step_by_step">
            <h3>Step By Step</h3>
            <p>Begin by navigating to our <a href="http://www.newtfire.org/dh/explainGitShell.html"
                    target="_blank">tutorial</a> and following the steps under <q>Let's Get
                    Started</q> to create a <a
                    href="http://www.newtfire.org/dh/explainGitShell.html#account" target="_blank"
                    >GitHub account</a> and <a
                    href="http://www.newtfire.org/dh/explainGitShell.html#setup" target="_blank"
                    >download Git Shell</a>. <strong>Do not rush through this process and be sure to
                    read thoroughly.</strong></p>
            <p>Once you have completed these two tasks navigate to our <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://github.com/ebeshero/DHClass-Hub">DHClass-Hub</a> repository. First
                read through the README.md file that displays at the bottom of the repo. This is a
                general welcome to the DHClass-Hub and details the basic workflow of using this
                repo.</p>
            <p>Next, you should <dfn>clone</dfn> the DHClass-Hub to your local computer. Follow our
                    <a href="explainGitShell.html#cloning"
                    target="_blank">tutorial steps on cloning</a>. Once you have the DHClass-Hub
                cloned navigate to the repo on your local computer. Search through the directory and
                find the folder called <q>sandbox</q>. The sandbox directory is a space for you to
                practice adding, committing, and pushing files to. Go ahead and add ANY file to the
                sandbox by dragging a file into that directory or saving a file from &lt;oXygen&gt;
                there. Notice others have added pictures, text files, and a variety of code files.
                You can open any of these files, but try not to delete any files you have not
                created yourself. In order for you to push that file we will need to add you as a
                collaborator. This is the perfect moment to create and/or comment on a GitHub issue.
                Navigate to the <a href="https://github.com/ebeshero/DHClass-Hub" target="_blank"
                    >DHClass-Hub GitHub page</a>. At the top of the page, under
                    <q>ebeshero/DHClass-Hub</q> you will see a tab that says <q>Issues</q>. In our
                    <a href="https://github.com/ebeshero/DHClass-Hub/issues" target="_blank"
                    >DHClass-Hub Issues Board</a> notice there are open issues and closed issues.
                Search through the open issues for an issue where others are asking to be added as a
                collaborator using keywords like <q>collaborator</q> or <q>add to sandbox</q> in the
                search bar. If there is such an issue already existing click on it to create a
                comment. If there is not an existing issue click the <q>New issue</q> button at the
                top of the page.</p>
            <p><img src="NewIssue_GitEx1.jpg" alt="GitHub Issues Board" /></p>
            <p>As mentioned in our tutorial section <a
                    href="explainGitShell.html#issue" target="_blank"
                        ><q>GitHub as Social Media</q></a>, issues and their comments are written in
                    <dfn>markdown language</dfn>. GitHub offers a comprehensive <a
                    href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/" target="_blank"
                    >guide to writing markdown</a> that you should reference as you find the
                necessity to create and comment on issues (especially when you want you to include
                segments of code). For the purposes of this assignment though you will only need to
                create an issue with the title <q>Adding Hub Collaborators</q> and/or comment in
                such an issue with your GitHub username <span class="smaller">(i.e. Dr.
                    Beshero-Bondar's username is <code>ebeshero</code>)</span>. Along with your
                username, also type the <code>@</code> symbol followed by Dr. Beshero-Bondar's
                username this will notify her to add you. In future issue comments use the
                    <code>@</code> and specify any GitHub user by their username and this will send
                an email or push notification to the user leading them to your comment as well as
                leave a link to their profile for the instances that you may be trying to designate
                credit to them. Your issue comment for this assignment should resemble this:</p>
            <p><img src="CommentIssue_GitEx1.jpg" alt="GitHub Issues Board Example Comment" /></p>
            <p>We will be monitoring the issue board to add collaborators so that you can complete
                your push to the Sandbox. If you have to wait a bit for us to add you, you can take some time to read our <q><a target="_blank"
                        href="https://github.com/ebeshero/DHClass-Hub/issues/99">Welcome to the
                        Issues Board</a></q> issue and our <a
                    href="https://github.com/ebeshero/DHClass-Hub/blob/master/Troubleshooting/Troubleshooting-Readme.md"
                    target="_blank">Troubleshooting-Readme</a>
                <span class="smaller">(which explains how to use the Troubleshooting folder in our
                    DHClass-Hub)</span>.</p>
            <p>At this point, if you have been notified that you were added as a collaborator, go
                ahead with the steps using Git Shell to <a
                    href="explainGitShell.html#working" target="_blank"
                    >add, commit, and push</a> your sandbox file to the DHClass-Hub. If you are
                still waiting to be added continue with the rest of this assignment, and finish your
                sandbox push once you have been added.</p>
            <p>Next, we want you to create your own repository. Later in this course you will be
                creating a personal website; therefore, we are having you create a Git repo that
                will correlate with the development of said site. To create a new repo go to your
                GitHub profile, select the <q>Repositories</q> tab, and click <q>New</q>.</p>
            <p><img src="NewRepo_GitEx1.jpg" alt="GitHub Create Repo" /></p>
            <p>Give your repo a logical name (i.e. my_page), a brief description, and select
                    <q>public</q>. During this course we ask you to keep this repo public so we can
                view each other’s site development without everyone in the course having to be added
                as a collaborator; however, you can switch this to private in the future. Now that
                you have created the repo on GitHub you need to <dfn><a
                        href="explainGitShell.html#cloning"
                        target="_blank">clone</a></dfn> it to your local computer (just like you
                cloned the DHClass-Hub above). After you have the repo cloned you can make some
                edits to your README.md file using markdown and/or add more files. Feel free to
                reference my <a href="https://github.com/RJP43/personalWebpage" target="_blank"
                    >GitHub repo</a> used for the development of my <a
                    href="http://newtfire.org/~rjp43/" target="_blank">personal website</a>. If for
                some reason you have not been added to the DHClass-Hub, to push your sandbox file,
                by the time this assignment is due make sure you practice adding, committing, and
                pushing a file using your personal page repo.</p>
            <p>Your final task is to navigate on GitHub to your personal page repo, and follow our
                    <a href="explainGitShell.html#collaborators"
                    target="_blank">tutorial steps to add a collaborator</a>. Add your instructor(s)
                to your repo. After the completion of this course you can remove any unwanted
                collaborators; however, for this assignment we want you to practice adding at least
                one collaborator. Also when creating your own repo you may need to change the
                settings to include an issues board; follow these <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://help.github.com/articles/managing-projects-with-issues/"
                    >help.github.com directions</a> to do so.</p>
