   	  <h3>The input text</h3>
       <p>The text we’ll be using as input for the first regex homework assignment is a plain-text
           version of Shakespeare’s sonnets, which you should download from <a
               href="http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1041/pg1041.txt"
               >http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1041/pg1041.txt</a>. Note that this site sometimes shows you a pop-up welcome screen and a
           list of different versions of the file, instead of taking you to the plain text one
           directly. If that happens, click OK on the Welcome pop-up and then select the version
           labeled Plain Text UTF-8.)</p>
           
           <ul><li>To download the file,  go to File and Save as in your web browser, and choose a useful name and location on your computer to save the file.
           We typically keep the <code>.txt</code> extension, and you might rename this as <code>YourName_Regex1_sonnets.txt</code>.)
           </li>
           <li>Then open &lt;oXygen/&gt;, and open the file you saved. </li>
            <li>You should manually delete any of the Project Gutenberg
           information from the beginning and end of this file, so that what you’re left with is
           just the sonnets in order, with roman numerals before each one.</li>
           </ul>
       <p>If you find it easier to work with a small amount of text, you can make yourself a
           document that contains just a few sonnets and use that during development. Once you
           think you’re getting the results you want, you can then try applying the same strategy
           to the entire file. The structure of this document is very regular, so whatever works
           for a handful of sonnets should work for all of them.</p>
       <h3>The task</h3>
       <p>Your goal is to produce an XML version of this file by using the search-and-replace
           techniques we discussed in class. Your output should look something like <a
               href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/shakespeare-sonnets.xml">http://dh.obdurodon.org/shakespeare-sonnets.xml</a>.
           That is, each sonnet should be its own element, each line should be tagged separately,
           and the roman numerals should be encoded in a useful way (we’ve used attributes, but you
           could also put them in a child element).</p>
       <h3>How to proceed</h3>
       <p>There are several ways to get to the target output, but here is how we might approach the
           task:</p>
       <h4>Reserved characters</h4>
       <p>The plain text file could, at least in principle, contain characters that have special
           meaning in XML: the ampersand and the angle brackets. You need to search for those and
           replace them with their corresponding XML entities; if you don’t remember the entity
           strings, you can look them up in the <q>Special Reserved Characters in XML</q>
           section of <a href="explainXML.html"
               >explainXML.html</a>. Note that you need to process them
           in the correct order. What is that order, and why is it important?</p>
       <h4>Title and author</h4>
       <p>The title and author at the top are going to have to be tagged manually. You can either
           remove them now and then paste them back in later, after you’ve tagged the sonnets, or
           you can leave them in place and fix them up at the end. You’ll use global
           find-and-replace to tag the sonnets, and if you leave the title and author in place
           while you do that, you’ll wind up tagging them incorrectly. That isn’t a problem as long
           as you remember to fix them manually at the end.</p>
       <p>To perform regex searching, you need to check the box labeled <q>Regular expression</q>
           at the bottom of the &lt;oXygen/&gt; find-and-replace dialog box, which you open with
           Control-f (Windows) or Command-f (Mac). If you don’t check this box, &lt;oXygen/&gt;
           will just search for what you type literally, and it won’t recognize that some
           characters in regex have special meaning. You don’t have to check anything else yet. Be
           sure that <q>Dot matches all</q> is unchecked, though; we’ll explain why below.</p>
       <h4>Leading space characters</h4>
       <p>The non-blank lines all begin with space characters: there are two spaces before most
           lines (the Roman numerals and the first twelve lines of each sonnet) and four spaces
           before the last two lines of every sonnet. Those spaces are presentational formatting,
           and not part of the content of the text, and since we don’t need them in order to tag
           the text, we’ll start by deleting them. The regex to match a space character is just a
           space character, and you can match one or more space characters by using the plus sign
           repetition indicator. To match one or more instances of the letter <q>X</q>, you would
           use a regex like <code>X+</code>. To match one or more instances of a space character,
           just replace the <q>X</q> with a space.</p>
       <p>You don’t want to remove all space characters, though; you just want to remove the ones
           at the beginning of a line. You can do that by using the caret metacharacter, which
           anchors a match so that it succeeds only at the beginning of a line. For example, if the
           regex <code>X+</code> matches one or more instances of <q>X</q>, the regex
           <code>^X+</code> matches one or more instances of <q>X</q>
           <em>only at the beginning of line</em>. You can use this information to match one or
           more space characters at the beginning of a line and replace them with nothing, that is,
           delete them.</p>
       <p>We aren’t going to use the blank lines in this approach, so you can delete those if you’d
           like, or you can leave them in place to enhance the legibility. To delete them, you need
           to match a blank line, and the easiest way to do that is to match two new line
           characters in a row and replace them with a single new line character. The regex for a
           new line character is <code>\n</code>. Try it.</p>
       <h4>Inside out or outside in</h4>
       <p>We can create our markup either from the outside in (document, then sonnet, then divide
           the sonnet into Roman numeral and lines) or from the inside out (lines and Roman
           numeral, then wrap those in a sonnet, then wrap all of the sonnets in a document).
           Either strategy can be made to work, but we generally find it easier to work from the
           inside out because when we work from outside in, it’s easy to wind up incorrectly
           wrapping <code>&lt;line&gt;</code> tags around the <code>&lt;sonnet&gt;</code> start and
           end tags, etc.</p>
       <h4>Lines</h4>
       <p>We’ll start by tagging every line as a <code>&lt;line&gt;</code>. This will erroneously
           tag the Roman numerals as if they were lines of poetry, which they aren’t, but it’s
           easier to let the first find-and-replace overgeneralize and then go back and retag the
           Roman numerals than to try to write a more constrained regex that won’t overgeneralize.
           We don't want to tag blank lines (if we left them in), though, so we need a regex that
           matches only lines that have characters in them. Remember where we told you above to
           make sure that <q>Dot matches all</q> was unchecked? Normally the dot (<code>.</code>)
           matches any character except a new line, which means that we can use the plus sign
           repetition indicator to match one or more instances of any character except a new line
           (that is, <code>.+</code>). By default regex selects the longest possible match, so even
           though just two characters on a line will match the pattern, when we run it it will
           always match the entire line. Since the dot matches any character except a new line, the
           regex will match each line individually, that is, it won’t run over a new line and
           continue the same match. Try it and examine the results. Now check <q>Dot matches
               all</q>, run Find all, and look at those results. Notice that the match no longer
           stops at the end of the line, and since you want to tag each line individually, you need
           to uncheck that box to revert to the normal, default behavior.</p>
       <p>A human might think of our task as <q>wrap every line in <code>&lt;line&gt;</code>
           tags</q>, but regex has a find-and-replace view of the world, so a regex way to
           think about it would be <q>match every line, delete it, and replace it with itself
               wrapped in <code>&lt;line&gt;</code> tags</q>. That is, regex doesn’t think about
           leaving the line in place and inserting something before and after it; it thinks about
           matching the line, deleting it, and then putting it back, but with the addition of the
           desired tags. The regex selects and matches each full line, but how do we write what we
           selected into the replacement string? The answer is that the sequence <code>\0</code> in
           the replacement pattern means <q>the entire regex match</q>, and you can use that to
           write the matched line back into the replacement, but wrapped in
           <code>&lt;line&gt;</code> tags. Try it.</p>
       <h4>Roman numerals</h4>
       <p>The Roman numerals are now erroneously tagged as if they were lines of poetry, and in our
           sample output at <a href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/shakespeare-sonnets.xml"
               >http://dh.obdurodon.org/shakespeare-sonnets.xml</a> we want them to be attribute
           values. To start that process we need to think about how to distinguish a Roman numeral
           line from a real line of poetry. Since there are 154 sonnets, a Roman numeral line is a
           line that contains one or more instances of <q>I</q>, <q>V</q>, <q>X</q>, <q>L</q>, and
           <q>C</q> in any order and nothing else, and no real line of poetry matches that
           pattern. That means that we can match that pattern by using a regex <dfn>character
               class</dfn>, which you can read about at <a
                   href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/charclass.html"
                   >http://www.regular-expressions.info/charclass.html</a>. This approach will match
           sequences that aren’t Roman numerals, like <q>XVX</q>, but those don’t occur, so we
           don’t have to worry about them. This illustrates a useful strategy: a simple regex that
           overgeneralizes vacuously may be more useful than a complex one that avoids matching
           things that won’t occur anyway. You can use the character class (wrapped in square
           brackets) followed by a plus sign (meaning one or more) to complete your regex so that
           it matches only <code>&lt;line&gt;</code> elements that contain a Roman numeral and
           nothing but a Roman numeral. Try it.</p>
       <p>In this case you want to write the Roman numeral into the replacement string, but you
           want to get rid of the spurious <code>&lt;line&gt;</code> tags and replace them with
           other markup. <code>\0</code> will write the entire match into the replacement, but that
           would include the original <code>&lt;line&gt;</code> tags that you want to remove. To
           capture part of a regex match, you wrap it in parentheses; this doesn’t match
           parenthesis characters, but it does make the part of the regex that’s between the
           parentheses available for reuse in the replacement string. For example,
           <code>a(b)c</code> would match the sequence <q>abc</q> and capture the <q>b</q> in
           the middle, so that it could be written into the replacement. Capturing a single literal
           character value isn’t very useful because you could have just written the <q>b</q> into
           the replacement literally, but you can also capture wildcard matches. For example,
           <code>a(.)c</code> matches a sequence of a literal <q>a</q> character followed by
           any single character except a new line followed by a literal <q>c</q> character, and you
           can use that information to capture everything between the <code>&lt;line&gt;</code>
           tags in the matched string. To write a captured pattern into the replacement, use a
           backslash followed by a digit, where <code>\1</code> means the first capture group,
           <code>\2</code> means the second, etc. (and in this case you’re capturing only one
           group). We’d build a replacement string that starts with a <code>&lt;/sonnet&gt;</code>
           end tag, then a new line, and then a <code>&lt;sonnet&gt;</code> start tag, including
           the <code>@number</code> attribute and using the captured string as its value, etc. Try
           it.</p>
       <h4>Clean up</h4>
       <p>You may have to clean up the beginning and end of the document manually, including the
           title and author, and you’ll also need to add a root element.</p>
       <h4>Checking your results</h4>
       <p>Although you’ve added XML markup to the document, &lt;oXygen/&gt; remembers that you
           opened it as plain text, which means that you can’t check it for well-formedness. To fix
           that, save it as XML with File → Save as and give it the extension <q>.xml</q>. Even
           that doesn’t tell &lt;oXygen/&gt; that you’ve changed the file type, though; you have to
           close the file and reopen it. When you do that, &lt;oXygen/&gt; now knows that it’s XML,
           so you can verify that it’s well formed in the usual way: Control+Shift+W on Windows,
           Command+Shift+W on Mac, or click on the arrow next to the red check mark in the icon bar
           at the top and choose <q>Check well-formedness</q>.</p>
       <h4>General</h4>
       <p>As we mention above, there are several ways to get to the target output, and whatever
           works is legitimate, as long as you make meaningful use of computational tools,
           including regular expressions (where appropriate), and don’t just tag everything
           manually. As you saw in class, there are ways to build your own regular expressions to
           match whatever patterns you need to identify, and the regex languages is complex and
           often difficult to read. The way we would approach this task is by figuring out what we
           need to match and then looking up how to match it. In addition to the mini-tutorial
           above, there is a more comprehensive description in the regex section of Michael Kay’s
           book and more detailed tutorial information at <a

        <h3>What to submit</h3>
        <p>We don’t need to see the XML that you produce as the output of your transformation
            because we’re going to recreate it ourselves anyway, but you do need to upload a
            step-by-step description of what you did. Your write-up can be brief and concise, but it
            should provide enough information to enable us to duplicate the procedure you
            followed.</p>
        <p>If you don’t get all the way to a solution, just upload the description of what you did,
            what the output looked like, and why you were not able to proceed any further. As
            always, you’re encouraged to post any questions on our <a href="https://github.com/ebeshero/DHClass-Hub/issues/">DHClass-Hub Issues board</a>!</p>
