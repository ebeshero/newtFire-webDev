            <h3>Preliminaries</h3>
            <p>Again, before beginning this assignment, please thoroughly read our tutorial: <a href="http://newtfire.org/dh/explainSchematron.html">Schematron</a>. This tutorial will be very useful to you during this assignment. You will need to save and open in &lt;oXygen/&gt; the collection of <a href="DickinsonFullWithErrors.xml">Dickinson’s Fascicle 16 poems</a> and the <a href="Dickinson_listWit.xml">list of witnesses</a> that are used to distinguish certain publications within the poems. You will be working mostly with the XML of the poems, but the XML containing the list of witnesses will be needed for one of the rules you will be defining within your Schematron. You will also need to open a new Schematron document in &lt;oXygen/&gt; under <strong>File → New → New Document → (scroll to Schematron in the alphabetized list) → Schematron</strong>. Once opened, you will keep the default xml line at the top, but you will delete everything from <code>&lt;sch:schema&gt;</code> down. To write Schematron rules for a document in the TEI namespace, you will then replace this with:</p>
            <pre>&lt;schema xmlns:sch="http://purl.oclc.org/dsdl/schematron" queryBinding="xslt2"
    xmlns:sqf="http://www.schematron-quickfix.com/validator/process"
    xmlns="http://purl.oclc.org/dsdl/schematron"&gt;
        &lt;ns uri="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" prefix="tei"/&gt;
        
        &lt;/schema&gt;</pre>
            <p><span class="smaller">You will be writing your Schematron <strong>inside</strong> the <code>&lt;/schema&gt;</code> root element. <br/> You will also need to use the <code>tei:</code> indicator before each of your elements for this exercise since we are working in TEI based documents.</span></p>

            <h3>Analysis of the task</h3>

                <h4>Background:</h4>
                <p>For this assignment, you will be creating a Schematron for a collection of Emily Dickinson’s poems. You will need to make several rules so that we can make sure all of the elements within the poems are uniform and contain the correct attributes and attribute values. We will also be creating a rule to make sure that all of the poems are in the correct reading order (Poem 1 to Poem 11).</p>
            </section>
            <section title="steps">
                <h4>Creating the rules step by step:</h4>
                <section title="rule1">
                    <p><strong>1. Making sure the <code>&lt;rdg&gt;</code> element is contained within an <code>&lt;app&gt;</code> element</strong></p>
                    <p>This rule is a simple one. Here we just want to make sure that all of our <code>&lt;rdg&gt;</code> elements are sitting in the right place: Notice that in the document hierarchy we have <code>&lt;lg&gt;</code> for line-groups or stanzas, and inside these are <code>&lt;l&gt;</code> elements. Inside the <code>&lt;l&gt;</code> elements we see lines of poetry, and these contain an <code>&lt;app&gt;</code> element whenever we are recording a set of variations on a line in the various manuscript and print editions of a poem. (In TEI this is called an <dfn>“apparatus”</dfn> element, and it is designed to hold variant <dfn>“reading witnesses”</dfn>. They must have a parent <code>&lt;app&gt;</code> element. within the <code>&lt;app&gt;</code> element that is contained within the <code>&lt;l&gt;</code> element that is contained within the <code>&lt;lg&gt;</code> element. When making this rule, go into the document full of poems and look at the hierarchy of the elements used. Unlike what we have been doing before, you will be walking <em>up</em> the hierarchy rather than walking down through it. Now try to make your rule.</p>
                    <p>Here’s a reminder of how to set up a rule using assert:</p>
                    <pre>&lt;pattern&gt;
        &lt;rule context="<strong><em>XPathGoesHere</em></strong>"&gt;
            &lt;assert test="<strong><em>AnotherXPathGoesHere</em></strong>"&gt;
                <strong><em>Whatever you want to assert goes here.</em></strong>
            &lt;/assert&gt;
        &lt;/rule&gt;
    &lt;/pattern&gt;</pre>
                    <p><span class="smaller">Remember that you are searching for parent elements and that you <em>must</em> use <code>tei:</code> before each element name, such as: <code>./parent::tei:app</code>.</span></p>
                </section>
                <section title="rule2">
                    <p><strong>Making sure each <code>&lt;rdg&gt;</code> element has an <code>@wit</code></strong></p>
                    <p>For this rule, we want to make sure that the <code>&lt;rdg&gt;</code> element has nothing but a <code>wit</code> attribute, but it <em>must</em> have this attribute. This will be a little different than the assert rule because we want the Schematron to tell us when <code>@wit</code> is <em>not</em> happening. This introduces us to use the <code>not()</code> function in our XPath expression, which will make your Schematron rule fire when your <code>&lt;rdg&gt;</code> does not have <code>@wit</code> or if it has anything other than <code>@wit</code>.</p>
                   <p>Here is a reminder of how to set up a rule using report:</p>
                    <pre>&lt;pattern&gt;
        &lt;rule context="<strong><em>XPathGoesHere</em></strong>"&gt;
            &lt;report test="<strong><em>AnotherXPathGoesHere</em></strong>"&gt;
                <strong><em>Whatever you want to report goes here.</em></strong>
            &lt;/report&gt;
        &lt;/rule&gt;
    &lt;/pattern&gt;</pre>
                </section>
                <section title="rule3">
                    <p><strong>Matching the <code>wit</code> attribute values to <code>xml:id</code> attribute values defined in the <a href="file:///C:/Users/Brooke/Downloads/Dickinson_listWit.xml">witness list</a> file.</strong></p>
                    <p>Now we are stepping into uncharted territory and learning something new with this Schematron rule! We will be matching our <code>&lt;rdg wit="…"&gt;</code> values within the poems to the <code>@xml:id</code> attributes within our list of witnesses. We will now be referring to <strong>two different</strong> XML documents when applying this rule, so make sure you have both documents open to test your XPath expressions before applying them to your rule. To create this rule, there are a few things we need to do:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Because we are stepping through another document that will not be associated with our Schematron, the first thing we need to do is to create a variable to place above the pattern, so it will be easier to direct our rule to what we want to match in the list of witnesses. We will be doing this by creating a <code>&lt;let&gt;</code> element. There are two attributes that must be inside <code>&lt;let&gt;</code>: <code>@name</code> and <code>@value</code>. <code>@name</code> is just giving your variable a name, which can be whatever you want (it doesn’t have to be witList). This will be used to represent what we have defined in our <code>@value</code>. The <code>@value</code> will contain our XPath expression for what we want to match to in the list of witnesses XML (the <code>@xml:id</code>.</p>
                            <p>In order to walk into our XML of witnesses, we need to use the <code>doc()</code> function. <code>doc()</code> functions kind of like a link element (<code>&lt;a href="…"&gt;</code>, except it is an XPath function. When you use <code>doc()</code> in XPath, you are essentially telling your Schematron that you are stepping into another document that will now be considered the root document. Next, we want to finish the XPath of <code>@value</code> by saying that we want to match all of the <code>@xml:ids</code>. Our finished <code>&lt;let&gt;</code> variable should look like this:</p>
                            <pre>&lt;let name="witList" value="doc(’Dickinson_listWit.xml’)//@xml:id"/&gt;</pre></li>
                        <li><p>Now we are going to create our rule using assert like we usually do. Another thing that is different for this rule is that we have to create yet <em>another</em> <code>&lt;let&gt;</code> variable so we can count the <code>@wit</code> values located in the poems.(This <code>&lt;let&gt;</code> will be positioned between the rule and assert.) We are going to set this variable up in the same way as we did before, meaning that it will have an <code>@name</code> and an <code>@value</code>.  Within the <code>@value</code> of this variable, we will be <strong>tokenizing the whitespace</strong> within the <code>@wits</code> of the poems. So our XPath is going to say that for every document within the <code>@wit</code> attribute, we are going to get rid of all the whitespace and then we are going to return whatever is after the <code>#</code>.</p>
                            <p>Again, just a refresher on what the basic part of our variable will look like:</p>
                            <pre>&lt;let name="<strong><em>WhateverYouWantToNameYourVariableHere</em></strong>" value="<strong><em>YourXPathHere</em></strong>"/&gt;</pre>
                            <p>To do this, we will be using the <code>tokenize()</code> function and the <code>substring-after()</code> function. The <code>tokenize()</code> function splits the a sting into a sequence of strings by treating whatever regex expression that is specified in the second part of the function as a separator. So in our case, we are separating our our original <em>entire</em> value of <code>@wit</code> into their own individual values by separating them based on where there is a whitespace (regex for finding whitespace will be: <code>\s+</code>) in our value. Here is what the <code>tokenize()</code> part of your XPath should look like:</p>
                            <pre>tokenize(., ’\s+’)</pre>
                            <p>As you can see, <code>tokenize()</code> must contain two arguments. Our first argument is "<code>.</code>", which means that we are matching on whatever is inside our <code>@wit</code>. Our second argument is "<code>\s+</code>", which is a regular expression for finding whitespace.</p>
                            <p>After we tokenize on the whitespace, we want to <strong>return</strong> only the part of these values <em>after</em> the <code>#</code>. To do this, we will use the <code>substring-after()</code> function. The <code>substring-after()</code> function is used to extract part of a string. The <code>substring-after()</code> part of your XPath should look like this:</p>
                        <pre>substring-after($i, ’#’)</pre>
                            <p>As you can see, we have to use a strange component as our first argument that looks like a variable, or how we would represent a variable. <code>$i</code> refers to a document as a whole when you are running your XPath over more than one document. For example, in this expression we are saying that we are going to come up with the string of characters after the <code>#</code> within each document. The <code>$i</code> tells us that the operation is going through <em>each</em> document, one by one, and grabbing these strings of characters.</p>
                            <p>Now we are going to put these two parts together to create our complete value of <code>@value</code>. Let’s put this into words first: <strong>For every document</strong>, we are going to <strong>tokenize</strong> all of the whitespace in the values of <code>@wit</code>. Then we are going to <strong>return</strong> the <strong>string of characters</strong> in <strong>each document</strong> after the <code>#</code>. so our complete variable should look something like this:</p>
                        <pre>&lt;let name="tokens" value="for $i in tokenize(., ’\s+’) return substring-after($i, ’#’)"/&gt;</pre>
                        <p><span class="smaller">Note: Your <code>@name</code> does not need to be tokens here, but I recommend that you use this because it will make sense later.</span></p></li>
                        <li><p>Now we are finally going to create the rule that will combine everything we have discussed in this section in order to make a rule that asserts us when a value of an <code>@wit</code> in our XML of poems does not match an <code>@xml:id</code> in our list of witnesses. What we want to assert is that every <strong>token</strong> in all of the <strong>tokens</strong> we have just previously declared in our variable <em>must</em> <strong>satisfy</strong> that each <strong>token</strong> must <strong>equal</strong> the variable that we named <code>witList</code>. Let’s follow this through in our <code>&lt;assert&gt;</code> element’s <code>@test</code>:</p>
                        <pre>&lt;assert test="every $token in $tokens satisfies $token = $witList"&gt;</pre></li>
                        <li>All you have to do now is put this entire rule together. Start with your initial variable that states that we are going into the outside XML that is a list of witnesses, start your rule (With your second variable coming right inside the <code>&lt;rule&gt;</code> element), and then create your assert.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
                <section title="rule4">
                    <p><strong>Making sure all of the poems are in the correct counting order within the document</strong></p>
                    <p>When transferring all of the poems in Dickinson’s Fascicle 16 into one document, they may not have transferred over in order. For example, maybe Poem 6 comes after Poem 7 instead of coming directly after Poem 5. This rule that we will create now will make sure the poems are in order. There are a few steps to do on our way to our finished rule:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>First we need to look over our XML document that is holding all of the poems and find out where all of the poem titles are located in the hierarchy. We know that these <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> elements are contained within the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element. This will go in the <code>&lt;rule&gt;</code> <code>@context</code> value.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Next, we need to create another variable (Yes, I know this is probably your least favorite thing to do right now, but it will help you in the long run with your own projects!). Within this variable we are going to define that we are looking for the number that is in the text node of the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> elements. Because the number of the poems resides in the text, we will have to define our variable to look into the text. This will require the following functions: <code>current()</code>, <code>substring()</code>, <code>number()</code>, and <code>string()</code>. The <code>current()</code> function gives us the original context item. The <code>substring()</code> function, much like <code>substring-after</code>, will return a specific string of characters. The <code>number()</code> function is used to convert any value to a number. And the <code>string()</code> function converts a number to a string. Okay, so let’s now start to define our variable.</p>
                            <p>First we need to define that we are looking for the number of the poem within the text, so this is where <code>substring()</code> comes into play. The <code>substring()</code> function must have three arguments. The first argument is going to represent our current node, so <code>current()</code>. Our second argument is going to represent on which character we want the string to begin at, which is character six because "Poem" is four characters long, followed by a space (one character), so the number of the poem is the sixth character. Our final argument is how many characters we want the string to include, and because there are eleven poems, we want to include two characters (to capture both double and single digits). Your <code>substring()</code> function should look something like this:</p>
                            <pre>substring(curent(), 6, 2)</pre>
                        <p>Now we want to turn this <code>substring()</code> into a number. To do this, you need to wrap what the entire <code>substring()</code> function with the <code>number()</code> function. Like this:</p>
                            <pre>number(substring(curent(), 6, 2))</pre>
                            <p>This will give us a number to work with so that we can determine that they are in the correct numeric order.</p>
                            <p>Now we are going to state that the poem that comes after what we are looking for is the number of the current poem plus one. In order to do this, we need to use the <code>string()</code> function to combine the number we just found with one. Your expression will look very similar to a mathematical expression:</p>
                            <pre>string(number(substring(current(), 6, 2)) + 1)</pre>
                            <p>Great job! Since your variable is now defined, we can start making the rule! First we are going to create an XPath that will go to the <strong>ancestor</strong> of <code>div[@type=’poem’]</code>, step down to the <strong>following</strong> <code>div[@type=’poem’]</code>, and then step down into the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element. Now here is where we need to use a predicate that uses the variable that we just defined. We want to make sure that our <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> <strong>matches</strong> the number we found in our variable. To do this, we will be using the <code>matches()</code> function. The <code>matches()</code> function tests whether or not a string matches a particular expression (the expression we just defined above). There are, again, two arguments within the <code>matches()</code> function. The first is the string that we are looking up, which is represented with "<code>.</code>". The second is what we are comparing this string to, or our variable. This is what your predicate should look like:</p>
                            <pre>tei:title[matches(., $<strong>YourVariableNameHere</strong>)]</pre>
                            <p>Test your rule. Is it firing for the last poem listed? It should be firing because whatever is following this poem, which is nothing, does not match the preceding number plus one! This is perfect, because you know that your rule is working! We need to fix this, though, so we need to go back up into the <code>@context</code> of the <code>&lt;rule&gt;</code> element. What we need to add is a predicate to the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element. We need our predicate to say that the title must have an <strong>ancestor</strong> that is a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element with an <code>@type=’poem’</code>, and this ancestor must have a <strong>following</strong> <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element. (Hint: Be mindful of where you place the square brackets!) Now try your rule out. It should not fire for the last poem title.</p></li>
