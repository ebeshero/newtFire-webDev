        <h3>What is Git? And why do we use it?</h3>
        <p>Git is a free, open-source version control system (VCS) designed to handle everything
            from small tasks to major projects. The major difference between Git and any other VCS
            is the way Git thinks about its data. Conceptually, most other systems store information
            as a set of files with a means to reference the changes made to each file over time.
            Git, on the other hand, thinks of its data more like a set of snapshots of a miniature
            filesystem. Every time you commit, or save the state of your project in Git, it
            basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a
            reference to that snapshot. To be efficient, if files have not changed, Git doesn’t
            store the file again, just a link to the previous identical file it has already stored.
            Git thinks about its data more like a stream of snapshots. This aspect of Git makes the
            reliability of being able to revert back to an exact moment in a project, for any given
            file or the project in its entirety, much more stable than other VCSs.</p>
        <p>Another great aspect of Git is the emphasis on local operation. Git doesn’t need to go
            out to the server to get the history of a project and display it for you – it simply
            reads it directly from your local database. This means you see the project history
            almost instantly, without having to wait for server network lag. This also means that
            there is very little you can’t do if you’re offline. Also when you do actions in Git,
            nearly all of them only add data to the Git database; therefore, it is hard to get the
            system to do anything that is not undoable or to make it erase data in any way. Finally,
            Git allows you to collaborate with different groups of people in different ways
            simultaneously within the same project through the distribution aspect called branching
            (details on branching will come later in this tutorial). For more information regarding
            what Git is and the benefits of using Git please visit <a href="http://git-scm.com/"

            Chacon and Ben Straub).</p>
        <h3>Why use Git Shell (command line)</h3>
        <p>Unlike the Graphical User Interfaces (GUIS), the command line is the only place you can
            take advantage of all the functions Git has to offer. The GUIs only implement the
            simplistic functionality of Git as a means to use Git at the most basic level. Once you
            know how to run the command line version, you can probably also figure out how to run
            the GUI version. However if you wish to read our tutorial with a focus on the GUI client
            please visit <a href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/github.xhtml">dh.obdurodon.org</a>. There
            is also a helpful, interactive tutorial on using the Git command-line interface
            available at <a href="http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1"

        <h4>The three parts of Git (important in using Git Shell)</h4>
        <p>When you manage a project using Git, you keep copies of all files (with additional
            information) on both your local machine and the online GitHub server. You work on your
            local machine, periodically pushing your changes onto the server so they’ll be
            accessible to your project partners, and periodically pulling changes made by your
            project teammates from the server to your local machine.</p>
        <p>Here is a bit more detail on each of the three parts of Git this tutorial will be
            emphasizing:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The online GitHub interface - located at <a href="http://github.com"
                    >www.github.com</a>. GitHub is a social network site built on top of Git, which
                developers can use to collaborate on projects while using Git for version control
                purposes. The web interface is where the remote version of your project will exist.
                This is the hub where project collaborators push change to and pull changes
                from.</li>
            <li>Your local file directory - this is where repositories on the local machine, of a
                single developer (you), are stored and edited. Git relies on users practicing good
                file management. It is important to take note where you configure Git to on you
                local computer in order to know where local changes to reposiotories are made.</li>
            <li>Git Shell - this is the tool used for accessing the local repositories and their
                remote counterparts. Through a series of Git Shell commands you can create, clone,
                and edit your GitHub repositories.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Let's get started!</h2>
        <h3 id="account">How to create a GitHub account:</h3>
        <p>Because GitHub is a social networking site, where people post their code so that it will
            be accessible to others, using it requires creating an account. You can create a free
            account by navigating to <a href="https://www.github.com">https://www.github.com</a>.
            You are not required to create an account using your pitt.edu address, although if you
            associate an educational email address with your account, GitHub will give you
            additional benefits.</p>
        <div class="accountImg"><img src="git_shell/creatingAccount_01.jpg"
                alt="Creating An Account" /></div>
        <p>To create your account, enter a user name, email address, and password and then click the
            green button that says Sign up for GitHub.</p>
        <div class="accountImg"><img src="git_shell/creatingAccount_02.jpg"
                alt="Creating An Account" /></div>
        <p>Keep the free option, which is the default, and then click the green button that says
            Finish sign up.</p>
        <div class="accountImg"><img src="git_shell/creatingAccount_03.jpg"
                alt="Creating An Account" /></div>
        <p>After creating your account, GitHub will prompt you to verify your email address.</p>
        <div class="accountImg"><img src="git_shell/creatingAccount_04.jpg"
                alt="Creating An Account" /></div>
        <p>Make sure to follow the link in the verification email.</p>
        <p>You will then be directed back to your account:</p>
        <div class="accountImg"><img src="git_shell/creatingAccount_05.jpg"
                alt="Creating An Account" /></div>
        <p>Note: You would benefit from exploring the sections from the above image that are
            surrounded in red. Now navigate to your account profile:</p>
        <div class="accountImg"><img src="git_shell/creatingAccount_06.jpg"
                alt="Creating An Account" /></div>
        <p>The following image highlights the basic functions that can be found by navigating
            through your account profile.</p>
        <div class="accountImg"><img src="git_shell/creatingAccount_07.jpg"
                alt="Creating An Account" /></div>
        <h3 id="setup">Downloading Git Shell</h3>
        <p>Git is avalable for <a
                href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">download</a> on
            all three of these platforms: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Linux</li>
            <li>Mac</li>
            <li>Windows</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To download Git on your local machine follow the instructions available at this link <a
                href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git"
                >https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git</a>.</p>
        <p>When considering if you want to download the desktop GUI client, in addition to Git
            Shell, it might be worth noting that some of the general functionability and ease of
            access through the GUI may be beneficial and useful to you. For example: configuring
            your local Git machine with your online account can be done through a few simple steps
            using the GUI. Seen in the image below:</p>
        <div class="clientImg"><img src="git_shell/desktopClientDownload_05.jpg"
                alt="configuring account using GUI" /></div>
        <p>The GUI also offers ease of entry to a repository's file directory and git shell access
            simply by right clicking on the desired repository's name. Again, see the image
            below:</p><div class="clientImg"><img src="git_shell/rightClick_repoONdesktop.jpg"
                alt="using GUI right click" /></div>
        <p>If you have decided not to use the GUI client to configure your local git you can do the
            configuration by opening Git shell and entering the following commands:</p>
        <span class="code">$ git config --global user.name 'Your Name Comes Here'<br /> $ git config
            --global user.email 'you@yourdomain.example.com'</span>
        <p> This will add the following to a file named .gitconfig in your home directory:</p>
        <span class="code">[user]<br /> name = Your Name Comes Here<br /> email =
            you@yourdomain.example.com</span>
        <p>To verify that you entered your information correctly use the command <code>$ git config
                --list</code>.</p>
        <h3 id="repo">Creating a Repository</h3>
        <h4>What is a repo?</h4>
        <p>Projects on GitHub are stored in repos (short for repositories), which you can think of
            as equivalent to folders or directories on your computer. Repos can contain plain files
            and subdirectories, so you can use the subdirectories to organize your project files
            according to whatever hierarchy makes sense to you. Initially you may want to put all of
            your project files into the main repo directory, and as you add additional files and
            your project becomes more complex, you can think about creating subdirectories and
            distributing the files among them according to file type or other criteria. Your project
            mentor will advise you about how to structure the directory space for your project.</p>
        <p>Your main project repo will reside on <a href="https://www.github.com"
                >https://www.github.com</a>, which is the public server that is accessible to
            others. It is possible to edit files directly on the server, but the normal way to
            interact with GitHub is to work on copies of the project files on your own machine and
            then, when you are satisfied with the state of your work, to push (upload) your new or
            modified files to the remote server so that your project partners will have access to
            them. Similarly, when your project partners push their changes to the server, those
            won’t be reflected in the copies on your local machine until you pull (download) them.
            The process of uploading files you have modified from your local machine to the GitHub
            server, and of downloading from the GitHub server files that your project partners may
            have developed or modified and uploaded, is called syncing (short for synchronization).
            Syncing with command line requires two basic commands: <code>git pull</code> and
                <code>git push</code>. The command <code>git pull</code> can be broken down into
                <code>git fetch</code> and <code>git merge</code>, but we will discuss the
            distinction later in this tutorial. When you begin a work session, you should start by
            syncing your local project space with the server using <code>git pull</code>, so that
            you’ll catch up on any changes other project contributors have made. When you reach a
            stopping point in your work when you have new or updated files that your project
            partners need to see, you should commit (<code>git commit</code>) and sync again, but
            this time using <code>git push</code>. You don’t have to push after every keystroke, but
            you should commit regularly and push whenever you reach a reasonably stable intermediate
            point to which your project partners should have access.</p>
        <h4>How to create a repo:</h4>
        <p>The best way to initiate a new repo, for our group projects, will be to create it through
            the online web interface. Easy to follow instructions on how to do this can be found
            here <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/"
                >https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/</a>. If a repo is created through
            the web interface it will need to be <a href="#cloning">cloned</a> in order for you to
            access it and begin working on your local computer.</p>
        <span class="smaller">(If you wish to create a repo by using Git Shell you only need to know one
            command: <code>$ git init</code>. This initializes a git repository by creating the
            initial .git directory in a new or an existing project pending on the directory
            preceding the command.)</span>
        <!-- rjp:2016-1-15: we need to test how to link local repos created with "git init" to the remote GitHub server. git remote add [shortname] [url] seems to be what all of the documentation point to; however, when I attempted to do this it didn't work (for the url I copy and pasted in the HTTP for my GitHub profile) -->
        <h3 id="collaborators">Adding and Deleting project collaborators</h3>
        <p>Alongside version control, one of GitHub’s most useful features is that it supports
            collaboration. Forget the days of emailing a file back and forth between group members
            as it is updated, or waiting to edit a document for fear of losing simultaneous edits.
            GitHub allows multiple collaborators to manage a repository. The only way to handle
            collaborators is through the web interface:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Go to <a href="https://www.github.com">https://www.github.com</a></p></li>
            <li><p>Sign in and navigate to your profile.</p>
                <p><img src="git_shell/addCollaborator_00.jpg" alt="Adding a Collaborator" /></p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Choose the <q>repositories</q> tab from your profile.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Select the repo to which you want to add a collaborator.</p>
                <p><img src="git_shell/addCollaborator_01.jpg" alt="Adding a Collaborator" /></p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Select <q>Settings</q> at the top of the screen.</p>
                 <p><img src="git_shell/addCollaborator_02.jpg" alt="Adding a Collaborator"
                 /></p></li>
            <li><p>On the Settings page, move to the menu on the left side of the page, and select
                        <q>Collaborators</q></p>
                <p><img src="git_shell/addCollaborator_03.jpg" alt="Adding a Collaborator"
                 /></p></li>
            <li>
                <p>Type the user name of the collaborator you want to add. (This means that you’ll
                    need to ask your collaborators to tell you their GitHub user names in advance.)
                    As you type, a drop down list will be generated matching what you have typed.
                    Select the user you would like to add from the list. Then click <q>Add
                        collaborator</q>.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="cloning">Cloning</h3>
        <p>As we explain above, the way you work on your project (create files, edit files, delete
            files) is to work on them on your local machine and then sync any modifications to the
            GitHub server, so that they will be accessible to your project partners. The technical
            term for copying a project from the GitHub server to your local machine initially so
            that you can begin to work on it there is called cloning. You only have to clone a
            project once, when you first begin to work on it. Cloning is the copying of a project
            already in existence to your local computer so that you can begin to work on it;
            whereas, <em>syncing</em> is exchanging updates between your local computer and the
            GitHub server after you’ve already cloned the repo and established a local copy in which
            you can work). This working model separates saving your work to your local computer
            (which you should do very frequently) and syncing your local clone of the repo with the
            master copy on the GitHub server, a design that protects you from uploading mistakes to
            the server. That is, you do your development on your local machine, where only you have
            access to the files, and when you’re ready to share your work with your project
            partners, you sync (upload) it explicitly to the server.</p>
        <h4>How to clone an existing repo:</h4>
        <p>To clone a repo from the remote online server using command line you use one easy
            command: <code>git clone</code>. After <code>git clone</code> you copy the url of the
            repo you wish to clone, a space, and then a name for the folder where the cloned repo
            will exist.</p>
        <div class="commandImg"><img src="git_shell/cloningArepo.jpg" alt="cloning a repo" /></div>
        <p>This creates a copy of the entire repository on your local machine and adds the original
            location as a remote so you can fetch from it again and push to it if you have
            permissions.</p>
        <h3 id="working">Basic Git workflow:</h3>
        <div class="diagramImg"><img src="git_shell/gitWorkflow.jpg" alt="git workflow" /></div>
        <ol>
            <li>Before you begin working you need to make sure your local repo is up to date with
                the remote server repo. To do this we can either use the commands <code>git
                    fetch</code> and <code>git merge</code> or the single command <code>git
                    pull</code>. By using <code>git fetch</code> and <code>git merge</code> you can
                first see the changes that are being brought into your local repo (or fetched) from
                the remote repo. This allows for you to upon review make the decision to "merge"
                those remote changes with your local repo. The command <code>git pull</code>
                combines the two previously mentioned commands into one step, which is convenient
                yet dangerous.<br />
                <img src="git_shell/gitFetchANDgitMerge.jpg" alt="git fetch and git merge" /><br />
                It is best practice to review all of the remote files you are bringing into your
                local repo. before merging. A detailed argument for always using <code>git
                    fetch</code> and <code>git merge</code> over <code>git pull</code> can be found
                    <a href="http://longair.net/blog/2009/04/16/git-fetch-and-merge/">here</a>.</li>
            <li>Begin working by modifying files in your "working directory". When you want to
                change a file, edit your local copy. You can do this by accessing the files on your
                local machine, like you would any file stored normally on your computer, and making
                changes. Be sure new files get saved in the file location configured with Git.</li>
            <li>After you have files created in your working driectory you need to inform Git that
                you saved the files in the git configured directory with purpose and tell git to
                take a snapshot of the changes. Unlike other VCSs, Git has something called the
                "staging area" or "index". This is an intermediate area where commits can be
                formatted and reviewed before completing the commit. One thing that sets Git apart
                from other tools is that it's possible to quickly stage some of your files and
                commit them without committing all of the other modified files in your working
                directory or having to list them on the command line during the commit. This allows
                you to stage only portions of a modified file. Gone are the days of making two
                logically unrelated modifications to a file before you realized that you forgot to
                commit one of them. Now you can just stage the change you need for the current
                commit and stage the other change for the next commit. This feature scales up to as
                many different changes to your file as needed. To stage a file, use the command
                    <code>git add</code>. If you want to stage all of the changed or newly created
                files stored in the working directory you can type <code>git add .</code>. To
                specify that you only want to stage a certain type of file you use an asterisk. For
                example: to stage all of the .html files you type <code>git add *.html</code>. If
                there is only a single file you want to stage you can type the filename after the
                command. For example: <code>git add index.html</code>.<br />
                <img src="git_shell/gitAdd.jpg" alt="staging files" /></li>
            <li>When you reach a point where you want to sum up the progress of your work in
                preparation for sharing, you do a commit. This takes the files as they are in the
                staging area and stores the staged snapshot permanently to your local Git directory.
                This is done with the command <code>git commit</code>. To write a commit message
                right inside of Git Shell type <code>git commit -m</code> followed by the commit
                message in quotes. If you just type <code>git commit</code> alone Git Shell will
                initiate a text editor (likely notepad) where you can add your commit message. From
                here you type your message, save it, and then upon closing your commit is complete.
                    <img src="git_shell/gitCommit.jpg" alt="git commit" /><br /> No matter what Git
                requires a commit message when committing!</li>
            <li>Once you are ready to share your changes with the rest of your project team you need
                to push your local changes to the remote GitHub server. This is done with the
                command <code>git push</code>.<br />
                <img src="git_shell/gitPush.jpg" alt="git push" /></li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="nav">Navigating Directories</h3>
        <p>When opening Git Shell from a shortcut link you will be placed in the main configuration folder you set up when installing Git. The following image explains how you navigate between directories:</p>
        <div class="commandImg"><img src="git_shell/navDirectory.jpg"
            alt="navigating through directories" /></div>
        <h3 id="branch">Branching: what is it, and why do we do it?</h3>
        <p>Branching means you diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work
            without messing with that main line. The master branch is the main branch of a project.
            When working in projects with multiple collaborators it may be important that the master
            branch not have errors, and always be in good working order. If everyone is writing new
            code into the master branch, it’s possible for the master branch to enter an unstable
            state temporarily. To avoid that, projects may require that all developers work on
            different parts of the project separately, in their own branches, and merge their
            individual development branches into the master branch only once they are confident that
            it won’t have a destabilizing effect. This can be useful even in single-developer
            projects if you need to maintain multiple versions, such as a stable branch that people
            should be able to download and use and a development branch that will eventually become
            the new stable branch, but that isn’t yet stable. Branches can be merged and deleted
            because a branch is an inalienable part of the repo in which it is created in; thus,
            working in a branch requires you to already have a cloned repo. Just to be clear, when
            you clone a repo that has existing branches the entire repo gets cloned including all of
            the repo's existing branches.</p>
        <p>To really understand the way Git does branching, we need to take a step back and examine
            how Git stores its data. As stated above, Git doesn’t store data as a series of
            changesets or differences, but instead as a series of snapshots. When you make a commit,
            Git stores a commit object that contains a pointer to the snapshot of the content you
            staged. This object also contains the author’s name and email, the message that you
            typed, and pointers to the commit or commits that directly came before this commit (its
            parent or parents). A branch, in Git, is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of
            these commits. The default branch name in Git is master. As you start making commits,
            you’re given a master branch that points to the last commit you made. Every time you
            commit, it moves forward automatically. </p>
        <h4>How to create a branch:</h4>
        <p>Before creating a branch it is important to note what branches are already a part of your
            local repo. To do this we use the command <code>git branch</code>. This command lists
            all the branches only in the local repo. The master branch came automatically from the
            source repo upon cloning as the main branch of the repo. To see all of the local
            branches, including the master branch, and the remote branches that can be pushed to we
            use the command <code>git branch --all</code>. Now to create a new local branch use the
            command <code>git branch</code> followed by what you wish to call the branch. For
            example: <code>git branch development</code> will create a branch called "development".
            To verify that a new branch was added, re-run the <code>git branch</code> command. You
            should now see the new branch. The star to the left of a branch name indicates where you
            are working, and this can be verified with <code>git status</code>. When you run
                <code>git status</code> Git Shell should return a line listing what branch you are
            on. For example: if you are working on the master branch Git will return the line "On
            branch master".</p><div class="commandImg"><img src="git_shell/createBranch.jpg"
                alt="creating a branch" /></div>
        <h4>How to switch between branches:</h4>
        <p>If you want work to appear under a specific branch you will need to switch to the desired
            branch before committing changes. To switch branches use the command <code>git
                checkout</code> followed by the name of the branch you wish to switch to. For
            example: <code>git checkout development</code> will switch you over to the "development" branch.<br />
            <img src="git_shell/switchBranch_01.jpg" alt="switching branches to change files" />
            <br /> You can verify that you have successfully switched branches by using either of
            the previously explained commands: <code>git branch</code> or <code>git
            status</code>.</p><div class="commandImg"><img src="git_shell/switchBranch_02.jpg"
                alt="switching between branches" /></div>
        <h4>How to merge branches and push changes to remote:</h4>
        <p>Once there have been changes made via a branch and you wish to combine those changes with
            the main (master) branch, you will need to do the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Use the command <code>git diff</code> followed by the names of the two branches you
                want to compare. For example: <code>git diff master development</code> will show the
                differences between the master branch and the development branch. If you want to
                just get a list of the files changed between the two branches you can change the
                command to <code>git diff --name-only</code> again followed by the names of the two
                branches you wish to compare.</li>
            <li>Then use <code>git status</code> or <code>git branch</code> to verify what branch you
                are currently working in. If you are not on the master branch you should switch to
                it using <code>git checkout master</code>.</li>
            <li>Once you have reviewed the differences you will want to merge the two branches. This
                is done with the <code>git merge</code> command followed by the name of the branch
                being merged into the master branch. For example: <code>git merge
                development</code>.</li>
            <li>To verify the merge was successful you can run <code>git diff</code> again, and if
                Git does not return anything that means there are no differences between the two
                branches.</li>
            <li>Now when you run <code>git status</code> it will show that local master is ahead of
                the remote origin. To fix this and bring the remote origin repo up to date with your
                local master, run the <code>git push</code> command.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="commandImg"><img src="git_shell/mergeBranch.jpg" alt="merging branches" /></div>
        <p>If you have done work in a branch, and you do not want to merge the changes into the
            master branch until others on your team have reviewed it you can push the branch and its
            changes before merging. As long as you have the branch selected in Git Shell, you can
            use the command <code>git push origin</code> followed by the name of the branch to
            update the remote repo with the new branch. For example: <code>git push origin
                development</code> will push the development branch and its changes to the remote
            origin. Now if another collaborator wish to clone the repo, and bring in your branch to
            their local repo they will be able to do so.</p>
        <h4>How to delete a branch:</h4>
        <p>Some branches are created only temporarily; therefore, you may desire to delete a branch
            before or after merging. The command <code>git branch -d</code> followed by the branch
            name will delete the specified branch; if the branch is not fully merged in its upstream
            branch or contained in the current branch, this command will fail with a warning.
            Otherwise if the branch has been successfully merged with another branch then the
            command will go through and the branch will be removed. Use <code>git branch</code> to
            verify deletion. If you wish to remove the branch whether it has been merged or not the
            command is altered slightly: <code>git branch -D</code> followed by the branch name.</p>
        <div class="commandImg"><img src="git_shell/deleteBranch.jpg" alt="deleting a branch"
             /></div>
        <h3>Forking: what is it and why do we do it?</h3>
        <p>Part of the open-source etiquette of GitHub is that developers are encouraged to copy and
            then improve code originally created by others. GitHub supports the creation of derived
            projects through forking. When you fork a repo, you create a copy of it under your own
            account, where it acquires an independent identity. You can do anything with a repo you
            created by forking someone else’s project that you can with a repo you created from
            scratch. The moment that you create the fork, your new repo is no longer synchronized
            with changes in the repo from which you copied it originally. If you fork a repo and
            make changes that you would then like to contribute to the original source, you can
            issue a pull request, inviting the developers of the original repo to merge your forked
            repo's changes into their original project.</p>
        <h4>How to fork and how to work in a fork:</h4>
        <p>To begin forking you need to navigate to the repo you wish to fork, and select the "fork"
            button in the top right of the screen.</p>
        <div class="accountImg"><img src="git_shell/forking_01.jpg" alt="forking a repo" /></div>
        <p>Next, you will need to navigate to the new forked repo created on your account. From
            here, follow the steps above on <a href="#cloning">cloning</a>, and clone the repo using
                <code>git clone</code> and the HTTPS of the forked repo. Make sure you are cloning
            the repo that is located on your account and not the source repo you forked from.</p>
        <div class="accountImg"><img src="git_shell/forking_02.jpg" alt="forking a repo" /></div>
        <p>In order for the forked repo to reference the source repo, you will need to set up the
            remote upstream. Do this with the following command: <code>git remote add
                upstream</code> followed by the HTTPS of the source repo. Use the command <code>git
                remote</code> or <code>git remote -v</code> to show all of the remote versions of
            your repository. You should see "origin" (the direct remote version of the forked repo)
            and the upstream you just created. When you want to sync your forked repo with the
            source repo you can use the following commands to do so: <code>git fetch upstream</code>
            and <code>git merge upstream</code>. These command function the same way in a fork as
            they did in the cloned repo (reference above for more detail).</p>
        <div class="commandImg"><img src="git_shell/forking_03.jpg" alt="forking a repo" /></div>
        <p>In the <a href="#branch">branching section</a> of this tutorial we discussed why using a
            branch is good practice. When working in a forked repo, branching becomes even more
            important and practical. The master branch is better to be left free of
            developmental/experimental changes so that it can be used to sync with the upstream
            (source repo). Therefore, it is best to add and change files in branches of your fork.
            After you have created a branch, modified files, and committed said changes use the
            command <code>git log --pretty=short</code> to see a listing of commits. Finally, to
            push all the local branches and change to the forked remote use the command <code>git
                push --all -u</code>. This command also sets up upstream tracking on all of the
            branches.</p>
        <div class="commandImg"><img src="git_shell/forking_04.jpg" alt="forking a repo" /></div>
        <h4>How to issue a pull request:</h4>
        <p>Now if we go back to our fork on GitHub, we can see that GitHub noticed that we pushed a
            new branch with changes to the source repo's code. GitHub presents us with a big green
            button to compare our changes and open a Pull Request to the original project. You can
            alternatively go to the "Branches" page at https://github.com/[user]/[project]/branches
            to locate your branch and open a new Pull Request from there.</p>
        <div class="accountImg"><img src="git_shell/pullRequest_01.jpg"
                alt="creating a pull request" /></div>
        <p>If we click that green button, we'll see a screen that asks us to give our Pull Request a
            title and description. It is almost always worthwhile to put some effort into this,
            since a good description helps the owner of the original project determine what you were
            trying to do, whether your proposed changes are correct, and whether accepting the
            changes would improve the original project or not. We also see a list of the commits in
            our forked repo's branch that are "ahead" of the master branch. Should this branch get
            merged by the project owner, a unified diff of all the changes will be made.</p>
        <div class="accountImg"><img src="git_shell/pullRequest_02.jpg"
                alt="creating a pull request" /></div>
        <p>When you hit the create pull request button, the owner of the project you forked from
            will get a notification that someone is suggesting a change with a link to a page that
            has all of the information you provided on it. At this point, the project owner can look
            at the suggested changes and merge it, reject it or comment on it. It is possible that
            the owner will ask you to "rebase from master" and resubmit a pull request. This might
            happen if a series of changes were made on the source repo's master branch that you had
            failed to fetch or if such changes were made after you submitted your request. This is
            not a problem! The following link will take you to a very thorough YouTube video on how
            to do this: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7ZYkjOWr6g"

        <h3>TAKING IT FURTHER...</h3>
        <p>Git and GitHub can be a bit confusing for new users, but it makes project management much
