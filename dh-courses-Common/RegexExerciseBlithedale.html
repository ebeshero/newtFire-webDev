   	  <h3>The task</h3>
        <p>We begin with a plain-text file, the Project Gutenberg EBook of <a
        	href="blithedale.txt"><cite>The Blithedale
                    Romance</cite></a>, by Nathaniel Hawthorne. We want to convert this file to XML
            but we don’t want to type all of the angle brackets manually. So what can we tag
            automatically, with global find-and-replace operations? Some of the markup we might want
            to introduce for analytical purposes might require us to touch every word of the text,
            but, at a minimum, we can autotag chapters, chapter titles, paragraphs, and quotations
            using regex tools, and that’s the goal of the present assignment.</p>
        <h3>Preliminaries</h3>
       <ul> <li>Select the plain-text version of the document and open it in &lt;oXygen/&gt; as a plain
            text file. Then cut out the front matter (before the main title title) and the back
            matter (after the last line of the text of the novel, which is <q>I--I myself--was in
                love--with--Priscilla! </q>). In Real Life we might want to mark those parts up
            eventually and reintroduce them into the XML as metadata, but for this assignment we’ll
            just delete everything that isn’t part of the text of the novel.</li>
       <li>Open Notepad or another plain-text editor on your computer and carefully record each step you take in writing patterns in the Find and Replace windows in &lt;oXygen/&gt;.
           (Please do not use Microsoft Word or a word-processing program for this 
           because you will have to struggle with the autocorrect functions in your word processor!). Save your file the usual way for homework exercises and use the file extension <code>.txt</code> (for example: RegexEx1_ebb.txt)
       for your text file that records your steps. Submit this file to Courseweb. This is how you will prepare this set of homework assignments for the Regular Expressions unit.
       </li>
       </ul>
        <h3>Step by step</h3>
        <p>There’s more than one way to accomplish this task, but one way to approach the problem is
            as follows:</p>
        <h4>Reserved characters</h4>
       <p>The plain text file could, at least in principle, contain characters that have special
           meaning in XML: the ampersand and the angle brackets. You need to search for those and
           replace them with their corresponding XML entities. (These are those character strings that start with an <code>&amp;</code> character.) 
           You can read some detailed information about entity strings and what they are for on Obdurodon’s <q>Entities and numerical character references</q>
           section of <a href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/what-is-xml.xhtml"
               >http://dh.obdurodon.org/what-is-xml.xhtml</a>, but for just a quick list, see <q>Special Reserved Characters</q> at the bottom of our <a href="explainXML.html">Introducing XML tutorial</a>. Note that you need to process them
           in the correct order, because of the ampersand (<code>&amp;</code>) in each one! 
           Think about this carefully: You <strong>always</strong> want to replace the &amp; characters first. (Why? Explain in your homework write-up.)</p>
     
        <h4>Extra blank lines</h4>
        <p>The blank lines are pseudo-markup that tell us where titles and paragraphs begin and end,
            but in some cases there are multiple blank lines in a row (for example, there are two
            blank lines between the title and the word <q>by</q>). Those extra blank lines don’t
            tell us anything useful, so we’ll start by getting rid of them. We want to retain one
            blank line between titles and paragraphs, etc., but not more than one.</p>
        <p>To perform regex searching, you need to check the box labeled <q>Regular expression</q>
            at the bottom of the &lt;oXygen/&gt; find-and-replace dialog box, which you open with
            Control-f (Windows) or Command-f (Mac). If you don’t check the <q>Regular expression</q>
            box, &lt;oXygen/&gt; will just search for what you type literally, and it won’t
            recognize that some characters in regex have special meaning. You don’t have to check
            anything else yet.</p>
        <p>The regex escape code that matches a new line is <code>\n</code>, so you want to search
            for more than two of those in succession, and you want to replace them with exactly two.
            You can search for three blank lines and replace them with two and then keep repeating
            the process until there are no instances of three blank lines left, or, more elegantly
            and efficiently, you can search for <code>\n{3,}</code>, which matches three or more new
            line characters in succession (see the <q>Limiting repetition</q> section of <a
                href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/repeat.html"
                >http://www.regular-expressions.info/repeat.html</a>) and replace them with
                <code>\n\n</code> (the quantifiers work only in matches, but not in replacements, so
            you have to write it this way).</p>
        <p>Note that a transformation that searches for a sequence of two end-of-line characters
            depends on their being immediately adjacent to each other. If what looks like a blank
            line to you actually has (invisible) spaces or tabs, the pattern won’t match and the
            replacement won’t happen because there will be spaces or tabs between the end-of-line
            characters, which is to say that they won’t be adjacent. If you think that might be the
            case, you can make those characters visible by going into the &lt;oXygen/&gt;
            preferences (Preferences → Editor) and checking the boxes labeled <q>Show
                TAB/NBSP/EOL/EOF marks</q> and <q>Show SPACE marks</q> under Whitespaces. If you do
            have whitespace characters interfering with your ability to find a blank line (that is,
            two consecutive new line characters), you can use regex processing to replace them: the
            pattern <code>\t</code> matches a tab character, a space matches a space, and
                <code>\s+</code> matches one or more white-space characters of any sort (including
            new lines). You can use the <q>Find</q> or <q>Find all</q> options in the
            find-and-replace dialog to explore the document and make sure that you’re matching what
            you want to match before you use <q>Replace all</q> to make the changes.</p>
        <h4>Paragraphs</h4>
        <p>What’s left after deleting the beginning and ending metadata and extra blank lines is
            mostly (except for the stuff at the top) a bunch of chapter titles and paragraphs,
            separated from one another by a single blank line, and we can use a regex to find all
            blank lines and replace them with the sequence <code>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;</code>. XML
            doesn’t care about the following, but for human legibility, we’d suggest inserting a new
            line character between the tags, instead of just outputting the end tag followed
            immediately by the start tag, so that each paragraph will start on a new line. You’ll
            have to add the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> start tag before the first paragraph and the
                <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code> end tag after the last one manually, but you can enter all
            of the rest automatically with a single regex-aware find-and-replace operation. At this
            point the document looks like a bunch of <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements. Some may
            contain chapter titles, rather than paragraphs. We’ll fix that below. At the top of the
            file, the title, author, and list of chapter titles will need special handling. We’ll
            talk about those below, too.</p>
        <h4>Chapter titles</h4>
        <p>The title of the first chapter within the body looks like:</p>
        <pre>&lt;p&gt;I. OLD MOODIE&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
        <p>the second looks like:</p>
        <pre>&lt;p&gt;II. BLITHEDALE&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
        <p>and we can see easily, from the list of chapter titles at the top, that there are
            twenty-nine chapter titles, each of which begins with a Roman numeral, then a period,
            and then a single space character, and each of which runs until the end of the line. No
            real textual paragraph looks like that, although some paragraphs could begin with the
            pronoun <q>I</q>, which looks like a Roman numeral, and some paragraphs might be only
            one line long. If we can write a regex that matches chapter titles and only chapter
            titles, then, we can replace the paragraph markup with title markup, retaining the part
            in the middle.</p>
        <p>We’re not going to write that regex for you, but we will tell you the pieces we used. Try
            building a regex and running <q>Find all</q> to verify that it is matching all of the
            chapter titles and nothing else. When you can match what you need, then you can think
            about how to craft the replacement string. Here are the pieces:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>First make sure that, under <q>Options</q>, <q>Case sensitive</q> is checked and
                        <q>Dot matches all</q> is unchecked. You want to do case sensitive matching
                    because the Roman numeral characters here are all upper case, so you want to be
                    able to distinguish those from lower case <q>i</q>, <q>v</q>, <q>x</q>, etc.
                    We’ll discuss when to use <q>Dot matches all</q> below, but for now, make sure
                    that it’s unchecked.</p></li>
            <li><p>You want to match the entire content of a line, and you can do that by using the
                        <code>^</code> (line start) and <code>$</code> (line end) <dfn>anchor</dfn>
                    metacharacters. If you type, say, <q>A</q> into the <q>Find</q> box and hit
                        <q>Find all</q>, you’ll match every upper-case <q>A</q> in the document (try
                    it). But if you type <q>^A</q>, you’ll only find an <q>A</q> at the very
                    beginning of a line. In other words <code>^</code> doesn’t match a caret
                    character; what it does is anchor the match so that it succeeds only if it falls
                    at the beginning of a line. Similarly, the <code>$</code> doesn’t match a
                    literal dollar sign; what it does instead is anchor a match so that it succeeds
                    only if it falls at the end of a line. This also means that <code>^A$</code>
                    will match only lines that consist of nothing except the letter <q>A</q>. You
                    don’t want to match lines that consist of nothing but the letter <q>A</q>, but
                    with the two anchors (<code>^</code>, <code>$</code>), the knowledge that the
                    dot (<code>.</code>) matches any character except a new line, andyour knowledge
                    of the regex repetition indicators (<code>?</code>, <code>+</code>,
                        <code>*</code>), you have all the pieces you need to craft a regular
                    expression that will match an entire line, no matter what the contents.</p></li>
            <li><p>A chapter title is (now) wrapped (misleadingly) in <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags
                    and fills a single line. That may not always be the case with other texts you’ll
                    need to process, but you can see that it is here, and you can take advantage of
                    that fact by searching for lines that begin with <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and end
                    with <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code> (using the line start and line end metacharacters
                    to match those tags only at the beginning and end of lines). But you also need
                    to match the stuff between the tags, and that’s different for every chapter. You
                    can handle that situation, as you did when you matched entire lines above, by
                    using the regex dot (<code>.</code>) metacharacter, which matches any character
                    except a new line. And since you don’t know the exact number of characters in
                    each title, you can match one or more characters by using the plus sign
                        (<code>+</code>) <dfn>repetition indicator</dfn>, which means <q>one or
                        more</q>. Now try putting these pieces together and matching all lines that
                    begin with a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> start tag, continue with one or more
                    characters (any characters except a new line), and end with a
                        <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code> end tag. When you look at the results, you’ll see
                    that you’ve matched all of the chapter titles, but also all other one-line
                    paragraphs. You’ve also matched the title, author, and a few other lines near
                    that top, but you’ll need to repair those manually at the end anyway.</p></li>
            <li><p>You now need to refine your regex so that you’ll continue to match chapter
                    titles, but not other one-line paragraphs. Since chapter titles begin with a
                    Roman numeral, you can modify your regex to match only if a Roman numeral
                    immediately follows the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> start tag. To do that you’ll use
                    a <dfn>character class</dfn>, which you can read about at <a
                        href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/charclass.html"
                        >http://www.regular-expressions.info/charclass.html</a>. You want to match
                    any sequence of <q>I</q>, <q>V</q>, and <q>X</q> characters in any order. This
                    will match sequences that aren’t Roman numerals, like <q>XVX</q>, but those
                    don’t occur, so you don’t have to worry about them. This illustrates a useful
                    strategy: a simple regex that overgeneralizes vacuously may be more useful than
                    a complex one that avoids matching things that won’t occur anyway. You can use
                    the character class (wrapped in square brackets) followed by a plus sign
                    (meaning <q>one or more</q>) to enhance your regex and match only one-line
                    paragraphs that begin with something that looks like a Roman numeral. Try
                    it.</p></li>
            <li><p>This almost works, but it also matches one-line paragraphs that begin with the
                    first person singular pronoun <q>I</q>, such as:</p>
                <pre>&lt;p&gt;I mentioned those rumors to Hollingsworth in a playful way.&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
                <p>To weed those out, you want to match a Roman numeral only if it’s followed
                    immediately by a period. Since the dot in regex is a metacharacter that matches
                    any character except a new line, if you want to match a literal period, you have
                    to <dfn>escape</dfn> the dot character by preceding it with a backslash
                        (<code>\</code>). Add that after the Roman numeral part of your regex, and
                    you should be matching only the twenty-nine chapter-title lines.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Matching the chapter titles is necessary but not sufficient: you now need to
                    replace the paragraph tags with <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tags. To do that we
                    need to <dfn>capture</dfn> the part of the title line that’s between the
                    paragraph tags and write that captured text into the replacement. To capture
                    part of a regex, you wrap it in parentheses; this doesn’t match parenthesis
                    characters, but it does make the part of the regex that’s between the
                    parentheses available for reuse in the replacement string. For example,
                        <code>a(b)c</code> would match the sequence <q>abc</q> and capture the
                        <q>b</q> in the middle, so that it could be written into the replacement.
                    Capturing a single literal character value isn’t very useful because you could
                    have just written the <q>b</q> into the replacement literally, but you can also
                    capture wildcard matches. For example, <code>a(.)c</code> matches a sequence of
                    a literal <q>a</q> character followed by any single character except a new line
                    followed by a literal <q>c</q> character. You can use that information to
                    capture everything between the paragraph tags in the matched string. To write a
                    captured pattern into the replacement, use a backslash followed by a digit,
                    where <code>\1</code> means the first capture group, <code>\2</code> means the
                    second, etc. In this case you’re capturing only one group, so you can build a
                    replacement string that starts with <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>, ends with
                        <code>&lt;/title&gt;</code>, and puts <code>\1</code> between them. You
                    don’t need to do anything about the line start and line end anchors; since
                    you’ve matched an entire line, the replacement will automatically be an entire
                    line.</p></li>
            <li>Putting this all together, you should be able to retag your titles automatically,
                distinguishing them from the paragraphs. Try it.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Chapters</h4>
        <p>A book isn’t just a series of paragraphs with titles strewn among them; the book has
            logical chapters, which must begin with a title, and you want to represent this part of
            the logical document hierarchy in your markup by inserting <code>&lt;chapter&gt;</code>
            tags. Much as you used blank lines as <dfn>milestone</dfn> delimiters between paragraphs
            earlier, you can now use your <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> elements as delimiters between
            chapters. Use a find-and-replace operation to do this; you’ll have to clean up the
            markup before the first chapter and after the last one manually, since in those cases
            the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element doesn’t have the same milestone function as
            elsewhere.</p>
        <h4>Quotes</h4>
        <p>How are quotations represented in the plain text? How would you find the text of a
            quotation, that is, how would you find where it starts, where it ends, and what goes
            between the start and the end? Files on the Internet sometimes have errors and
            inconsistencies; if you’re relying on cues in the text to identify the beginnings and
            ends of quotations, what can happen if you miss one?</p>
        <p>If we assume that a quotation is text between opening and closing quotation marks (which
            are the same in this text, which has straight quotation marks, instead of the curly
            typographic ones where the opening and closing shapes are different), we have at least
            two concerns:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A line may have more than one quotation. If we write a regex like <code>".+"</code>
                (including the quotation marks), will we match each quotation individually, or will
                we match the first quotation mark on the line and the last, erroneously gobbling up
                everything between into one spurious quotation? Try it and see.</li>
            <li>Some quotations span multiple lines. Since the dot matches any character except a
                new line, if we write <code>".+"</code> and the start and end quotation marks are on
                different lines, we’ll fail to match those quotations, and we may erroneously match
                material between ending and starting quotation marks, instead of only between
                starting and ending ones. Try it and see.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Let’s address the second problem first. There’s a line in the text that reads:</p>
        <pre>without further question, only," added she, "it would be a convenience</pre>
        <p>which represents the end of one quotation and the beginning of another. If we write
                <code>".+"</code>, the system will incorrectly think that the first quotation mark
            opens a quotation and the second closes one, and it will also fail to recognize that the
            material before and after that line is really part of a quotation. We can fix this by
            checking the <q>Dot matches all</q> box, which changes the meaning of the dot
            metacharacter from <q>any character except a new line</q> to <q>any character including
                a new line</q>. This means that we should be able to match quotations that cross
            line boundaries. Try it and notice the different results. Uh-oh!</p>
        <p>So what went wrong? By default regular expressions are <dfn>greedy</dfn>, which means
            that they make the longest possible match. Turning on <dfn>dot all</dfn> mode causes the
            regex to match everything from the very first quotation mark in the entire text through
            the very last (since quotation mark characters are also characters, the dot in the regex
                <code>".+"</code> matches the quotation marks between the first and last ones in the
            document, just like it matches any other character). Turning off dot all mode won’t fix
            this because some quotations do cross line boundaries, and we need to be able to
            recognize and match them.</p>
        <p>We can resolve the problem by turning on dot-all mode (since we have to match quotations
            that span line breaks) but also specifying that the match should be
                <dfn>non-greedy</dfn>, that is, that we should make the <em>shortest</em> possible
            match (instead of the longest, which is the default), and we do this by following the
            repetition indicator (the plus sign) with a question mark. (Note that the question mark
            you met earlier is a repetition indicator that means <q>zero or one instance</q> of
            whatever it follows. Here is isn’t a repetition indicator, though; here it means
                <q>don’t be greedy</q>. So if the same symbol can have two such different meanings,
            how does a regex processor know which meaning to apply?) In other words
                <code>".+?"</code> will correctly treat two full quotations on the same line as
            separate quotations. Try it. You should now correctly be matching each quotation fully,
            regardless of whether it spans a new line character and regardless of the number of
            quotations on a line.</p>
        <p>Once you can do that, you can capture the text between the quotation marks and write it
            into the output between <code>&lt;quote&gt;</code> tags. Don’t include the quotation
            mark characters themselves in the capture group; those are plain-text pseudo-markup, and
            now that you’re going to be tagging quotations with real markup, you don’t want the
            quotation mark characters included.</p>
        <h4>Cleanup</h4>
        <p>At this point you can fix the title and author lines manually (we’d just delete the line
            that reads <q>by</q>, since the new <code>&lt;author&gt;</code> tags will make that
            explicit), as well as the table of contents, and you need to wrap the entire document in
            a root element (such as <code>&lt;book&gt;</code>). If you’d like a little more regex
            practice, instead of fixing the table of contents manually, you can use regex
            find-and-replace to tag it. If you select the table of contents and then open the
            find-and-replace dialog, you can check the <q>Only selected lines</q> box under
                <q>Scope</q> to say that instead of applying find-and replace operations to the
            entire file, you’ll apply them only to the selected lines. You may want to start by
            stripping out incorrect markup that you’ve inserted when your global find-and-replace
            operations earlier changed these lines, as well—and of course you’ll want to do that
            with a regex that matches any tag and replaces it with nothing (that is, deletes it).
            Once you’ve done that, these lines look like title lines, except that they have space
            characters before them, and you can use a regex that matches one or more space
            characters to help match them. You can then capture each line (throwing away the leading
            white space by excluding it from the capture) and wrap it in <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>
            tags. You’ll want to get rid of the paragraph tags that are wrapping the whole table of
            contents, since it isn’t a paragraph, and replace it with something like
                <code>&lt;toc&gt;</code> (for <q>table of contents</q>).</p>
        <h4>Checking your results</h4>
        <p>Although you’ve added XML markup to the document, &lt;oXygen/&gt; remembers that you
            opened it as plain text, which means that you can’t check it for well-formedness. To fix
            that, save it as XML with File → Save as and give it the extension <q>.xml</q>. Even
            that doesn’t tell &lt;oXygen/&gt; that you’ve changed the file type, though; you have to
            close the file and reopen it. When you do that, &lt;oXygen/&gt; now knows that it’s XML,
            so you can verify that it’s well formed in the usual way: Control+Shift+W on Windows,
            Command+Shift+W on Mac, or click on the arrow next to the red check mark in the icon bar
            at the top and choose <q>Check well-formedness</q>.</p>
        <h3>What to submit</h3>
        <p>We don’t need to see the XML that you produce as the output of your transformation
            because we’re going to recreate it ourselves anyway, but you do need to upload a
            step-by-step description of what you did. Your write-up can be brief and concise, but it
            should provide enough information to enable us to duplicate the procedure you
            followed.</p>
        <p>If you don’t get all the way to a solution, just upload the description of what you did,
            what the output looked like, and why you were not able to proceed any further. As
            always, you’re encouraged to post any questions on our <a href="https://github.com/ebeshero/DHClass-Hub/issues/">DHClass-Hub Issues board</a>!</p>
