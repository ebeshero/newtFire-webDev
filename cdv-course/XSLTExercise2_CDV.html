        <h3>The input text</h3>
        <p>For this assignment we’ll be producing HTML from an XML file originally prepared by students in the
            Nell Nelson project team in the fall of 2015 and modified for use in this XSLT
            exercise. The XML file is available here: <a
                href="NelsonArticle_1888-07-30.xml"
                >http://newtfire.org/dh/NelsonArticle_1888-07-30.xml</a>. You should right-click on
            this link, download the file, and open it in &lt;oXygen/&gt;.</p>
        <h3>The usual housekeeping:</h3>
        <p>Because this document is not in a namespace, we do not need the
                <code>@xpath-default-namespace</code> attribute, and the only thing we need to add
            to &lt;oXygen&gt;’s default XSLT stylesheet template. We also add our usual
                <code>&lt;xsl:output&gt;</code> line that we use when producing HTML (for making
            sure we produce valid HTML 5 in XHTML format). Here’s what we need:</p>
        <pre>
          &lt;xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
    xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
    xmlns:math="http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math" exclude-result-prefixes="xs math"
    <span style="color:blue;">xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" version="3.0"</span>&gt;
    <span style="color:purple;">&lt;xsl:output method="xhtml" encoding="utf-8" doctype-system="about:legacy-compat"
        omit-xml-declaration="yes"/&gt;</span>
            
        </pre>
        <h3>Overview of the assignment</h3>
        <p>We’re going to work with this entire XML document (on all levels of the
            hierarchy), concentrating on processing the XML “salad” of mixed text and in-line elements to style them for presentation on the web
            in HTML’s limited tagset. You can use some of the basic HTML in-line elements, like
                <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> for emphasis or <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> for strong
            emphasis, but you’ll also want to use CSS to set some elements to have different colors
            or background colors or to alter borders or fonts or font sizes or font styles (e.g.,
            italic) or font weights (e.g., bold) or add text decoration (e.g., underlining) or text
            transformation (e.g., convert to all upper case) … well … really anything stylistically
            possible.</p>
        <p>There are several types of in-line elements in our input XML document, but for the purposes
            of this assignment we will focus on processing the paragraphs (<code>&lt;p&gt;</code> inside the <code>&lt;articleBody element&gt;</code> to receive special tagging:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>&lt;unclear&gt;</code> This element will require special attention (described
                below)!</li>

            <li><code>&lt;headLine&gt;</code></li>

            <li><code>&lt;workingConditions&gt;</code> For the purpose of this assignment we only
                want you to grab this element when it appears below the
                    <code>&lt;articleBody&gt;</code> element.</li>

            <li><code>&lt;dialogue&gt;</code></li>

            <li><code>&lt;femVoice&gt;</code> For the purpose of this assignment we only want you to
                process this element when it appears inside of the <code>&lt;dialogue&gt;</code>
                element. </li>

            <li><code>&lt;nellVoice&gt;</code> For the purpose of this assignment we only want you
                to process this element when it appears inside of the <code>&lt;dialogue&gt;</code>
                element.</li>

            <li><code>&lt;mascVoice&gt;</code> For the purpose of this assignment we only want you
                to process this element when it appears inside of the <code>&lt;dialogue&gt;</code>
                element.</li>

            <li><code>&lt;company&gt;</code> For the purpose of this assignment only style the
                company names that have the attribute and value
                <code>@name="identified"</code>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some are immediately inside <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements in the article body (like
                <code>&lt;workingConditions&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;unclear&gt;</code>). Others sit inside other in-line elements like all of the voice tags sitting inside of
                <code>&lt;dialogue&gt;</code> elements or <code>&lt;headLine&gt;</code> elements
            that sit inside the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element. You may not know at the outset
            which ones can be inside which other ones, or how deeply they can nest. Happily, with
            XSLT, unlike with many other programming languages, you don’t need to care about those
            questions!</p>
        <p>An example of possible desired output can be found here <a
                href="1888-07-30_XSLTresults.html"
                >http://newtfire.org/dh/1888-07-30_XSLTresults.html</a>, though we did not style the body paragraphs in this output file. It is important to note
            that the majority of the styling choices on this file are controlled with a CSS file.
            You will make your own CSS and relate it to your XSLT; therefore, your stylistic choices
            might vary greatly from ours and your output may look completely different. What should
            look relatively similar is the underlying raw HTML, which is generated by running the
            XSLT. By viewing the page source of our output you can review the underlying raw HTML
                (<a href="view-source:http://newtfire.org/dh/1888-07-30_XSLTresults.html"
                >view-source:http://newtfire.org/dh/1888-07-30_XSLTresults.html</a>).</p>
        <h3>Guide to Approaching the Problem</h3>
        <p>In XSLT, processing something normally happens in two parts. You normally have an
                <code>&lt;xsl:apply-templates&gt;</code> element that tells the system what elements
            (or other nodes) you want to process, and you then have an
                <code>&lt;xsl:template&gt;</code> element that tells the system exactly how you want
            to process those elements, that is, what you want to do with them. If you find the image
            helpful, you can think of this as a situation where the
                <code>&lt;xsl:apply-templates&gt;</code> elements <em>throw some nodes out into
                space and say <q>would someone please process these?</q>
            </em>and the various <code>&lt;xsl:template&gt;</code> elements sit around watching
            nodes fly by, and when they <strong>match</strong> something, they <em>grab it and
                process it</em>.</p>
        <p>Therefore, for this assignment, your XSLT transformation (after all the housekeeping)
            should have several template rules:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin with a template rule for the document node (<code>&lt;xsl:template
                    match="/"&gt;</code>), in which the basic HTML output is created: the
                    <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element, <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and its contents,
                and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>. Inside the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element that
                just created, use <code>&lt;xsl:apply-templates&gt;</code> and select the various
                    <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> elements (using XPath expressions indicating where
                they are in the source XML for each of the values of the <code>@select</code>
                attributes) and then do the same to select the <code>&lt;articleBody&gt;</code>
                text.</li>
            <li>Then create separate template rules that match on each of the inline elements you
                are required to style, so each rule will be invoked as a result of the preceding
                    <code>&lt;xsl:apply-templates&gt;</code> selection from our first template
                rule.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In this case, then, your <code>@select</code> on the
                <code>&lt;xsl:apply-template&gt;</code> elements inside the template rule for the
            document node will tell the system what specific elements (using their XPath location in
            the source XML) you want to appear and where in your output HTML you wish for them to
            appear. You create the order each selection appears by placing the various
                <code>&lt;xsl:apply-template&gt;</code> elements in the desired order inside of that
            first template rule matching on the document node. This will tell the system that you
            want to <strong>select</strong> only certain elements, at which point the template rule
            for the document node will call out what portions of the document need to be processed
            at this particular point. The processing work actually gets done by the other
                <code>&lt;xsl:template&gt;</code> rules, the ones that you write to then
                <strong>match</strong> on the elements that need styled.</p>
        <h3>Analysis of the task</h3>
        <h4>How to process richly mixed content</h4>
        <p>Prose paragraphs with in-line elements that might contain other in-line elements are
            richly mixed content, with varied and unpredictable combinations of elements and plain
            text. This is the problem that XSLT was designed to solve. With a traditional procedural
            programming language, you’d have to write rules like <q>inside this paragraph, if
                there’s a <code>&lt;dialogue&gt;</code> do X, and, oh, by the way, check whether
                there’s a <code>&lt;nellVoice&gt;</code> or a <code>&lt;company&gt;</code> inside
                the <code>&lt;dialogue&gt;</code>, etc.</q> That is, most programming languages have
            to tell you what to look for at every step. The elegance of XSLT when dealing with this
            type of data is that all you have to say inside paragraphs and other elements is <q>I’m
                not worried about what I’ll find here; just process <strong>(apply templates
                    to)</strong> all my children, whatever they might be.</q></p>
        <p>The way to deal with mixed content in XSLT is to have a template rule for every element
            and use it to output whatever HTML markup you want for that element and then, inside
            that markup, to include a general <code>&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;</code>, not
            specifying a <code>@select</code> attribute. For example, if you want your
                <code>&lt;nellVoice&gt;</code> to be tagged with the HTML
                <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> tags, which means <q>strong emphasis</q> and which is
            usually rendered in bold, you could have a template rule like:</p>
        <pre>&lt;xsl:template match="nellVoice"&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
      &lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;
  &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;</pre>
        <p>You don’t know or care whether <code>&lt;nellVoice&gt;</code> has any children nodes or,
            if it does, what they are. Whatever they are, this rule tells the system to try to
            process them, and as long as there’s a template rule for them, they’ll get taken care of
            properly somewhere else in the stylesheet. If there are no children nodes, the
                <code>&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;</code> will apply vacuously and harmlessly. As
            long as every element tells you to process its children, you’ll work your way down
            through the hierarchy of the paragraph without having to know which elements can contain
            which other elements or text nodes.</p>
        <h4>Taking stock: when to use <code>@select</code></h4>
        <p>In our <a href="explainXSLT.html">XSLT tutorial</a> we describe the use of
                <code>&lt;xsl:apply-templates select="…"/&gt;</code> which specifies exactly what
            you want to process and where. That makes sense when your input and output are very
            regular in structure. <em>Use the <code>@select</code> attribute when you know exactly
                what you’re looking for and where you want to put it.</em> We will want to use
                <code>&lt;xsl:apply-templates select="…"/&gt;</code> in order to grab all of the
                <code>&lt;headline&gt;</code> elements sitting inside of the
                <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element and to output them inside of the
                <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element at the beginning of your XSLT transformation
            separate from the <code>&lt;articleBody&gt;</code> text. We will also want to use the
                <code>&lt;xsl:apply-templates select="…"/&gt;</code> in order to place the rest of
            the source text sitting inside of <code>&lt;articleBody&gt;</code> into a
                <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element below the headlines. By setting up these very
            specific selections of these elements we are deciding the placement of where the
            headlines of the source document sit in relation to the rest of the text found in
                <code>&lt;articleBody&gt;</code> for our HTML output. It would also be logical to
            add heading elements in the HTML portion of our XSLT to indicate placement of the
                <code>&lt;newspaperTitle&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;seriesTitle&gt;</code>,
                <code>&lt;date&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;byline&gt;</code> elements. Consider where
            each of these elements’ placements make sense in relation to the
                <code>&lt;headline&gt;</code> elements and the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element
            containing the text from the <code>&lt;articleBody&gt;</code> element. <span
                class="smaller">Don’t forget what is represented in the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>
                element of your XSLT is the basic superstructure of your output HTML document;
                therefore, the content inside of the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element, including
                the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element, will not appear unless the underlying HTML
                is being viewed. Hence the importance in creating visible header elements
                    (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, etc.) that contain the actual
                title and byline information.</span></p>
        <p>For the rest of this assignment, you don’t know (and don’t need to know) the order and
            nesting hierarchy of whatever salad of elements and plain text you might find inside
                <code>&lt;articleBody&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> or its sub-elements. You
            just want to process whatever comes up whenever it comes up.
                <code>&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;</code> without the <code>@select</code> attribute
            says <q>apply templates to whatever you find.</q>
            <em>Omit the <code>@select</code> attribute where you don’t want to have to think about
                and cater to every alternative individually.</em> (You can still treat them all
            differently because you’ll have different template rules to <q>catch</q> them, but when
            you assert that they should be processed, you don’t have to know what they actually
            are.)</p>
        <h4>What should the output look like</h4>
        <p>HTML provides a limited number of elements for styling in-line text, which you can read
            about at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_formatting.asp"
                >http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_formatting.asp</a>. You can use any of these in
            your output, but note that presentational elements, the kind that describe how text
            looks (e.g., <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> for <q>italic</q>), are generally regarded as less
            useful than descriptive tags, which describe what text means (e.g.,
                <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> for <q>emphasis</q>). Both of the preceding are normally
            rendered in italics in the browser, but the semantic tag is more consistent with the
            spirit of XML than the presentational one.</p>
        <p>The web would be a dull world if the only styling available were the handful of
            presentational tags available in vanilla HTML. In addition to those options, there are
            also ways to assign arbitrary style to a snippet of in-line text, changing fonts or
            colors or other features in mid-stream. To do that:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Before you read any further in this page, read Obdurodon’s <a
                        href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/class-and-span.html">Using
                            <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> and <code>@class</code> to style your HTML</a>
                    page.</li>

            <li><p>To use the strategies described at that page, create an XSLT template rule that
                    transforms the element you want to style to an HTML <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>
                    element with a <code>@class</code> attribute. For example, you might transform
                        <code>&lt;nellVoice&gt;</code> in the input XML to <code>&lt;span
                        class="nellVoice"&gt;</code>...text node (represented in XSLT with
                        <code>&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;</code>) ...<code>&lt;/span&gt;</code> in
                    the output HTML. You can then specify CSS styling by reference to the
                        <code>@class</code> attribute, as described in the page we link to
                    above.</p>
                <p>Note that you can make your transformations very specific. For example, instead
                    of setting all <code>&lt;workingConditions&gt;</code> elements to the same HTML
                        <code>@class</code>, you can create separate template rules to
                        <strong>match</strong> on workingConditions according to their attribute
                    values. For example, <code>&lt;xsl:template
                        match="workingConditions[@category='positive']"&gt;</code> is a normal XPath
                    expression to match <code>&lt;workingConditions&gt;</code> elements only if they
                    have a <code>@category</code> attribute with the value <q>positive</q>. So
                    within that matching template rule you create a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>
                    element with a logical <code>@class</code> (let’s say positive) and then simply
                    place the <code>&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;</code> inside of the span. Then in
                    the CSS make reference to the <code>@class</code>, again as described in the
                    page we link to above.</p></li>
            <li>This next part really exercises your XPath skills! Note that directly inside of the
                    <code>&lt;root&gt;</code> element in the <code>&lt;toneElements&gt;</code>
                element the <code>@category</code> attributes of the
                    <code>&lt;workingConditions&gt;</code> elements are listed with an
                    <code>@id</code> associated to the <code>@category</code> attributes of the
                    <code>&lt;workingConditions&gt;</code> elements and an <code>@tone</code>
                attribute declaring values of <q>good</q>, <q>bad</q>, or <q>neutral</q>. You can
                write a <strong>matching rule</strong> that will <dfn>dereference</dfn> the
                    <code>@category</code> attribute on, say, <code>&lt;workingConditions
                    category="positive"&gt;...text node...&lt;/workingConditions&gt;</code>, look up
                whether this is a good, bad, or neutral tone, and set the <code>@class</code> value
                accordingly. You could then make all good working Conditions one color and all bad
                working conditions a different color, letting XPath look up the tone reference for
                you. <em>Hint: In your XSLT matching template rule set the <code>@category</code> of
                    an inline <code>&lt;workingConditions&gt;</code> element <strong>equal
                        to</strong> the XPath steps of the specific associated <code>@tone</code>
                    attributes in the <code>&lt;toneElements&gt;</code> list. Then precede with the
                        <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> and <code>@class</code> setup detailed above.</em>
                A similar <dfn>dereference</dfn> can be made with the <code>@connotation</code>
                attribute on the variety of voice tags (<code>&lt;femVoice&gt;</code>,
                    <code>&lt;nellVoice&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;mascVoice&gt;</code>).</li>
            <li>Setting the <code>@class</code> attributes in the output HTML makes it possible
                    to style the various <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements differently according to
                    the value of those attributes, but you need to create a CSS stylesheet to do
                    that. Create the stylesheet (just as you’ve created CSS in the past), and
                    specify how you want to style your <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements. Link the
                    CSS stylesheet to the XSLT by creating the appropriate <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>
                    element inside of the HTML <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element of your XSLT (you
                    can remind yourself of the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element format by
                    referencing our <a href="explainCSS.html">CSS Tutorial</a>).</li>
            <li>Besides wrapping your <code>&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;</code> in
                        <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements and other HTML elements (Hint: including
                    HTML heading elements say if you want each of your <code>&lt;headLine&gt;</code>
                    elements to appear as individual headings instead of block text) you might
                    consider adding extra spaces or text outside some of these as well. For example,
                    in our HTML output note that each of the voice tags have some added words
                    appearing in front of the quoted speeches (where the sex of the speaker or if
                    Nelson was the speaker is indicated). Also we added double
                        <code>&lt;br/&gt;</code> elements to add space around the blocks of
                    dialogue. Use what you think looks best and provides the most readable HTML
                    output. </li>
       
        <li>The element <code>&lt;unclear&gt;</code> will need a slightly different rule
                <strong>matching</strong> on it. If you refer back to the source document and XPath
            your way to the empty self-closing <code>&lt;unclear/&gt;</code> elements, you might
            notice that the purpose of this element in the original document was to take place for
            word(s) that the project team was unable to transcribe due to the poor quality of the
            original source images. We do not want to lose the information that there are words
            missing when we transform this document into HTML. Like all other XML elements the
                <code>&lt;unclear&gt;</code> element will disappear and therefore we will no longer
            have the marker telling the reader that there is a word missing here! Since
                <code>&lt;unclear&gt;</code> is an empty element, it contains no text of its own to
            process, so if we want to output anything in our HTML for it, we need to generate that
            text ourselves. To remedy this we want to write a template rule <strong>matching on
                    <code>&lt;unclear&gt;</code></strong>, and inside of that rule we want to include
            some placeholder informational text, a kind of <dfn>pseudomarkup</dfn>, just to indicate there is a word missing. 
            Here’s how we chose to present it (and you may choose to do this differently):
            <pre><code>&lt;xsl:text&gt;</code>[missing word(s)]<code>&lt;/xsl:text&gt;</code></pre>
            Check out <a href="1888-07-30_XSLTresults.html">our sample output</a> to see the result of that template rule more clearly.

        </li> 
        </ol>
            
          
        <h3>Your Final Results</h3>
        <p>What you should produce, then, is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>An XSLT stylesheet that transforms the contents of the source document into HTML.
                Including placing the <code>&lt;headline&gt;</code>,
                    <code>&lt;newspaperTitle&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;seriesTitle&gt;</code>,
                    <code>&lt;date&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;byline&gt;</code> elements in relation
                to the <code>&lt;articleBody&gt;</code> text using HTML heading elements
                    (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, etc.) and a
                    <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element.</li>

            <li>The resulting HTML should also style the eight different types of in-line elements
                listed above in detail (<code>&lt;unclear&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;headLine&gt;</code>,
                    <code>&lt;workingConditions&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;articleBody&gt;</code>,
                    <code>&lt;dialogue&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;femVoice&gt;</code>,
                    <code>&lt;nellVoice&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;mascVoice&gt;</code>, and
                    <code>&lt;company&gt;</code>) and at least some of those styles should be set
                using <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements with the <code>@class</code>
                attribute.</li>

            <li>You need to create a CSS file, <strong>linked to your output HTML</strong>, that
                specifies how to style the output document. You can look up the most useful of the
                available CSS properties at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/">http://www.w3schools.com/css/</a>. We’d suggesting following the links on the
                left under <q>CSS styling</q> for styling backgrounds, text, and fonts, as well as
                the link for borders under <q>CSS box model</q>.</li>

            <li>We will be checking that you transform the <code>&lt;unclear&gt;</code> elements and
                that your transformation clearly indicates the presence of missing text for every
                instance of this previous XML element.</li>

            <li>You must link either the tones of the various voice elements
                    (<code>&lt;nellVoice&gt;</code>,<code>&lt;femVoice&gt;</code>,<code>&lt;mascVoice&gt;</code>)
                by the <code>@connotation</code> attribute or the tones of the
                    <code>&lt;workingConditions&gt;</code> elements by the <code>@category</code>
                attribute to produce <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>
                <code>@class</code> attributes that link to the three tones provided in the
                    <code>&lt;toneElements&gt;</code> list at the top of the XML source document.
                You can choose to style both of these elements in this manner; however, it is only
                required that you style one of these sets of elements (the various connotations of
                the voice elements <strong>OR</strong> the various
                    <code>&lt;workingConditions&gt;</code> categories) for full credit.</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Important</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Before submitting your homework, you must run the transformation at home</em> to
                make sure the results are what you expect them to be. There’s a guide to running
                XSLT transformations inside &lt;oXygen/&gt; on Obdurodon at <a
                    href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/oxygen-xslt-configuration.html"
                    title="How to run a transformation in oXygen"
                    >http://dh.obdurodon.org/oxygen-xslt-configuration.html</a>. If you don’t get
                the results you expect and can’t figure out what you’re doing wrong, remember that
                you can post a query to our <a href="https://github.com/ebeshero/DHClass-Hub/issues"
                    >DHClass-Hub Issues board</a>. You can’t just ask for the answer, though; you
                need to describe what you tried, what you expected, what you got, and what you think
                the problem is. We often find, just as we’re preparing to post our own queries to
                coding discussion boards, that having to write up a description of the problem helps
                us think it through and solve it ourselves. We’re also encouraging you to discuss
                the homework on the discussion boards because that’s also helpful for the person who
                responds. Answering someone else’s inquiry and troubleshooting someone else’s
                problem often helps us clarify matters for ourselves!</li>

            <li>When you complete this assignment, you need to submit your XSLT file and CSS file to
                Courseweb, following our usual homework file-naming conventions. We will run your
                XSLT transformation to see what output it generates, so you do not need to submit
                your output file. However, it is important that you include your CSS so we can
                locally associate it to your XSLT (keeping them in the same folder space) and see
                your final output. <strong>You should link the CSS in the XSLT for us!</strong></li>
