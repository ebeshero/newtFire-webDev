        <h3>The input text</h3>
        <p>For this assignment we’ll be using an XML file originally prepared by students in the Nell Nelson project team last fall. 
            We’ve modified it for use as an XSLT exercise, and the new version
            is available here at <a href="NelsonArticle_1888-07-30.xml">http://newtfire.org/dh/NelsonArticle_1888-07-30.xml</a>. You should
            right-click on this link, download the file, and open it in &lt;oXygen/&gt;. This is the same file used in XSLT Exercise 3; therefore, you do not need to download this file again if you still have it saved for the previous assignment. 
        </p>
        <p>Because this document (unlike our work with the Georg Forster Voyage File or the Digital Mitford Site Index) is not in a namespace,
            you should not add the <code>@xpath-default-namespace</code> attribute, and we do not need to alter &lt;oXygen&gt;'s default XSLT stylesheet template at all this time.</p>
        <p>To begin your XSLT stylesheet should look like this:</p>      
        <pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
      xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
         xmlns:math="http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math"
    exclude-result-prefixes="xs math"
    <span style="color:purple;">xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"</span>
         version="3.0"&gt;
    
         <span style="color:green;">&lt;xsl:output method="xhtml" doctype-system="about:legacy-compat"/&gt;</span>
    
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;</pre>
        
        <h3>Overview of the assignment</h3>
        <p>For this assignment we’re going to work with all of the text contained in <code>&lt;div type="newspaperArticle"&gt;</code>,
            concentrating on processing the in-line elements to style the text. You can use some of
            the basic HTML in-line elements, like <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> for emphasis or
            <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> for strong emphasis, but you’ll also want to use CSS to
            set some elements to different colors or background colors or borders or fonts or font
            sizes or font styles (e.g., italic) or font weights (e.g., bold) or text decoration
            (e.g., underlining) or text transformation (e.g., convert to all upper case) … well …
            anything else. We describe below how to do that.</p>
        <p>There are several types of in-line elements in the input XML document, for the purposes of this assignment we will focus on these few:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>&lt;workingConditions&gt;</code></li>
            
            <li><code>&lt;dialogue&gt;</code></li>
            
            <li><code>&lt;femVoice&gt;</code></li>
            
            <li><code>&lt;nellVoice&gt;</code></li>
            
            <li><code>&lt;mascVoiceVoice&gt;</code></li>           
            
            <li><code>&lt;company&gt;</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some are immediately inside  <code>&lt;articleBody&gt;</code> and some sit inside other in-line elements like all of the voice tags sitting inside of <code>&lt;dialogue&gt;</code> elements or <code>&lt;workingConditions&gt;</code> inside of <code>&lt;headLine&gt;</code> elements that sit typically (but not always) inside the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element. You may not know at the outset which ones can be inside which other ones, or how deeply they can nest. Happily, with XSLT, unlike with many other programming languages, you don’t need to care about those questions!</p>
        
        
        <p>The desired output will look like:</p>
        <div class="code">
            
        </div>
        <p>The underlying raw HTML, which we generated by running XSLT, should look like this:</p>
        <pre>
         
         
      </pre>
        
        <h3>Analysis of the task</h3>
        <p></p>
        <ol>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Important</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Before submitting your homework, you must run the transformation at home</em> to
                make sure the results are what you expect them to be. There’s a guide to running
                XSLT transformations inside &lt;oXygen/&gt; on Obdurodon at <a
                    href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/oxygen-xslt-configuration.html"
                    title="How to run a transformation in oXygen"
                    >http://dh.obdurodon.org/oxygen-xslt-configuration.html</a>. If you don’t get
                the results you expect and can’t figure out what you’re doing wrong, remember that you can post a query to our <a href="https://github.com/ebeshero/DHClass-Hub/issues">DHClass-Hub Issues board</a>. You can’t just ask for the answer,
                though; you need to describe what you tried, what you expected, what you got, and
                what you think the problem is. We often find, just as we’re preparing to post our
                own queries to coding discussion boards, that having to write up a description
                of the problem helps us think it through and solve it ourselves. We’re also
                encouraging you to discuss the homework on the discussion boards because that’s also
                helpful for the person who responds. Answering someone else’s
                inquiry and troubleshooting someone else’s problem often helps us clarify matters for
                ourselves!</li>
            <li>When you complete this assignment, you need only submit your XSLT file to Courseweb, following our usual homework file-naming conventions. We will run your XSLT transformation to see what output it generates, so you do not need to submit your output file.</li>
        </ul>
