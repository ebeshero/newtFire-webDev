        <!--2015-09-29 ebb: Our Goal: We're revising this so that it applies many of the same tasks with XPath String Functions to a different file entirely, my syllabus file for the Fall 2015 Greensburg DH course. Our tasks probably won't look exactly the same as Obdurodon's XPath 4, but let's try to include
            * tokenizing a string and selecting a part of it, 
            * matching on something that contains a particular string (and possibly finding its neighboring element). 
            * applying string-join() and concat()
            * We can also adapt the Optional Challenge to try to output a numbered concatenated list in the XPath results window. 
        -->

        <p>You can find an XML (TEI) version of our Fall 2015 DH class syllabus at <a

            <!-- 2015-09-29 alk just a note to perhaps specify a right-click save
            here since copying all the text over to Oxygen results in a damaged XML-->
            this file to save locally on your computer, and open it in &lt;oXygen/&gt;.</p>
        <p>You should consult <cite class="sub"><a href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/functions.xhtml"
                    >The XPath Functions We Use Most</a></cite> page and especially its section III.
            on Strings. Also, if you have the Michael Kay text, it may be useful to you here. As
            always, consult our class notes and our introductory guide <cite class="sub"><a
                    href="explainXPath.html">Follow the XPath!</a></cite>. After you’ve completed
            your homework, save your answers to a file and upload it to CourseWeb as an attachment.
            (Please use an attachment! If you paste your answer into the text box, CourseWeb may
            munch the angle brackets.) Some of these tasks are thought-provoking, and even
            difficult. If you get stuck, do the best you can, and if you can’t get a working answer,
            give the answers you tried and explain where they failed to get the results you wanted.
            Sometimes doing that will help you figure out what’s wrong, and even when it doesn’t, it
            will help us identify the difficult moments. These tasks require the use of path
            expressions, predicates, and functions. There may be more than one possible answer.</p>
        <p>Using the <cite>Pitt-Greensburg syllabus</cite> XML document and the XPath browser window
            in &lt;oXygen/&gt;, construct XPath expressions that will do the following (give the
            full XPath expressions in your answers, and not just the results):</p>
        <ol>
            <!--2015-09-29 ebb: Okay! Here's here we have to start revising. Play around with the tasks being asked for, and hunt about
            in my syllabus file to see if you can come up with similar tasks! Let me know how this goes or if you get stuck.-->
            <li>
                <!--ebb: To begin, I was thinking of trying this with a list of Assignment URLs, or a list of all the websites in the Pitt domain, or even a list of the dates on the syllabus...Hunt about for something reasonably short that we can grab, that might look good in a comma or semicolon or hyphen separated list: what might work here?-->
                There are two books referenced in the syllabus using the tag 'bibl'. What Xpath will
                return a comma-seperated list of the authors?
                <!-- alk: Use of string-join(). This might be a good start question because the concept scales but is only a small amount
               of data. A: string-join(//bibl/author, ‘,’) -->
            </li>


            <li>There are multiple authors of the second book - let's refine the solution to the
                first question by removing "Authors:" from that result. What Xpath function can we
                use to seperate "Authors:" from the rest of the string, and throw it away, leaving "
                Bruce Hyslop, Lenny Burdette, and Chris Casciano"? (hint: It will be helpful to
                refer to punctuation here, and use a predicate to filter your final results.)
                <!-- alk: Use of tokenize() at :, then a predicate to filter the results and return only the part they want
                A: tokenize((//bibl)[2]/author, ':')[2] -->
            </li>


            <li> Which 'div' elements contain references to 'homework'? What Xpath tells us the
                context of these references, the parent elements of the homework references?
                <!-- alk: uses contains() and  then looks for parent element A: //div[contains(., 'homework')] -->
            </li>

            <li> How many 'div' elements of type 'assign' contain references to our sister site,
                Obdurodon? Find the longest and shortest divs of this type in the document. How long
                and short are they?
                <!-- alk: contains() with 
                with attrib added and then a simpler version of the challenge--></li>

            <li> Let's concatente some dates! Can you smash together all of the 'date' elements in
                the document into one giant disgusting string? <!-- alk: concat() --></li>

            
            <li>Optional (but reccomended!) challenge question: Using the function format-date(), 
                Can you output all of the Friday dates on the syllabus? You’ll first need to change 
                your Oxygen path version to 3.0 next to the search box if it’s not already 3.0. 
                Then you’ll need to look up the details of format-date() on w3 schools. Be careful - 
                not all of the dates in the xml file are uniform and suitable for processing - to 
                simplify things you’ll want to look only in divs of type ‘day’.</li>
