        <!--2015-09-29 ebb: Our Goal: We're revising this so that it applies many of the same tasks with XPath String Functions to a different file entirely, my syllabus file for the Fall 2015 Greensburg DH course. Our tasks probably won't look exactly the same as Obdurodon's XPath 4, but let's try to include
            * tokenizing a string and selecting a part of it, 
            * matching on something that contains a particular string (and possibly finding its neighboring element). 
            * applying string-join() and concat()
            * We can also adapt the Optional Challenge to try to output a numbered concatenated list in the XPath results window.

            on Strings. Also, if you have the Michael Kay text, it may be useful to you here. As
            always, consult our class notes and our introductory guide <cite class="sub"><a
                    href="explainXPath.html">Follow the XPath!</a></cite>. After you’ve completed
            your homework, save your answers to a file and upload it to CourseWeb as an attachment.
            (Please use an attachment! If you paste your answer into the text box, CourseWeb may
            munch the angle brackets.) Some of these tasks are thought-provoking, and even
            difficult. If you get stuck, do the best you can, and if you can’t get a working answer,
            give the answers you tried and explain where they failed to get the results you wanted.
            Sometimes doing that will help you figure out what’s wrong, and even when it doesn’t, it
            will help us identify the difficult moments. These tasks require the use of path
            expressions, predicates, and functions. There may be more than one possible answer.</p>
        <p>Using the <cite>Pitt-Greensburg syllabus</cite> XML document and the XPath browser window
            in &lt;oXygen/&gt;, construct XPath expressions that will do the following (give the
            full XPath expressions in your answers, and not just the results):</p>
        <ol>
            <!--2015-09-29 ebb: Okay! Here's here we have to start revising. Play around with the tasks being asked for, and hunt about
            in my syllabus file to see if you can come up with similar tasks! Let me know how this goes or if you get stuck.-->
            <li>What XPath will return a hyphen-separated list of all characters without duplicates.
                <!--ebb: To begin, I was thinking of trying this with a list of Assignment URLs, or a list of all the websites in the Pitt domain, or even a list of the dates on the syllabus...Hunt about for something reasonably short that we can grab, that might look good in a comma or semicolon or hyphen separated list: what might work here?-->
                There are two books referenced in the syllabus using the tag 'bibl'. What Xpath will
                return a comma-seperated list of the authors?
                <!-- alk: Use of string-join(). This might be a good start question because the concept scales but is only a small amount
               of data.-->
            </li>


            <li>There are multiple authors of the second book - let's refine the solution to the
                first question by removing "Authors:" from that result. What Xpath function can we
                use to seperate "Authors:" from the rest of the string, and throw it away? (hint: It
                will be helpful to refer to punctuation here, and use a predicate to filter your
                final results.)
                <!-- alk: Use of tokenize at :, then a predicate to filter the results-->
            </li>













            <!-- The resulting list will look something like: <pre>Claudius-Hamlet-Polonius ...</pre>
                Our solution uses <code>distinct-values()</code> and <code>string-join()</code>.
                Note that there are several ways to identify the characters in this markup,
                including the <code>&lt;castList&gt;</code> element, the
                    <code>&lt;speaker&gt;</code> elements, and the <code>@who</code> atribute on the
                    <code>&lt;sp&gt;</code> element. Which should you use and why?</li>   -->
            <li>Most metrical lines (<code>&lt;l&gt;</code>) have an <code>@xml:id</code> attribute
                with a value like <q>sha-ham101010</q>, ending in a six-digit number. The first
                digit is the act, the next two the scene, and the last three the line in the scene.
                Some metrical lines are split across multiple speakers, and in that case the
                six-digit number in the <code>@xml:id</code> value is followed by <q>I</q> (initial
                part), <q>M</q> (middle part), or <q>F</q> (final part). In a few places there may
                be more than one middle part, and in those cases the <q>M</q> is followed by a
                one-digit number. For example, one of Hamlet’s lines
                is:<pre>&lt;l xml:id="sha-ham502277M2" n="277"&gt;One.&lt;/l&gt;</pre> which is the
                second middle part. What XPath will return the number of <code>&lt;l&gt;</code>
                elements that are middle parts? Our solution uses <code>count()</code> and
                    <code>contains()</code>.</li>
            <li>Sometimes Rosencrantz speaks by himself and sometimes he speaks in unison with Guildenstern.<ol>
                    <li>What XPath finds all of the speeches by Rosencrantz, whether alone or
                        together with Guildenstern? Our solution uses a single instance of
                            <code>contains()</code>.</li>
                    <li>Can you think of an alternative solution that doesn't use any functions
                        (just a predicate)?</li>
                </ol></li>
            <li>
                <p>The <code>string-length()</code> function can be used in two ways. You can wrap
                    it around an argument, so that, for example, <code>string-length('Hi,
                        Mom!')</code> will return 8, the length in character count of the string
                    inside the quotation marks. It can also be used as part of a path expression, so
                    that, for example, if the XPath <code>//sp</code> returns a sequence of all
                        <code>&lt;sp&gt;</code> elements, <code>//sp/string-length(.)</code> returns
                    a sequence of the lengths of all <code>&lt;sp&gt;</code> elements as measured by
                    counting characters. This works by finding all of the <code>&lt;sp&gt;</code>
                    elements and then (next path step) getting the string length of each one.
                    Remember that the dot inside the parentheses refers to the current context node,
                    which is the member of the sequence of <code>&lt;sp&gt;</code> nodes that is
                    being processed at the moment. We need to use the subterfuge because
                        <code>string-length(//sp)</code> generates an error. The problem is that
                        <code>string-length()</code> can take only a single argument, and
                        <code>//sp</code> returns more than one item. Putting the
                        <code>string-length()</code> function on its own path step with a dot inside
                    means that it applies once for every <code>&lt;sp&gt;</code> element, and that
                    each time it applies, it has just a single argument.</p>
                <p>Use this information to identify an XPath that finds the length of the longest
                    speech. What length does it return? Our solution uses
                        <code>string-length()</code> and <code>max()</code>.</p>
            </li>
            <li><em>Optional, challenging question:</em> Given the preceding solution, how can you
                use that XPath to retrieve the longest <code>&lt;sp&gt;</code> itself? No fair
                checking the length and then writing a separate XPath that looks for that number.
                Your answer must find the longest speech without your knowing how long it is. Our
                solution doesn’t require any additional functions beyond the ones used in #4, but it
                does use a complicated predicate.</li>
            <li><em>Optional, very challenging question:</em> What XPath produces a numbered list of
                all characters, without any duplicates, which should look something like:<ol
                    style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                    <li>Claudius</li>
                    <li>Hamlet</li>
                    <li>Polonius</li>
                    <li>...</li>
                </ol>There are several possible solutions, each of which raises issues that you may
                not have seen before. If you get an error message, try to figure out what it means
                and how to resolve it.</li>
