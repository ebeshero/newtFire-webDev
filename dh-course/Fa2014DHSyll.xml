            <head>Digital Humanities / Studies: Course Description</head>
            <p>Our course in "digital humanities" and "digital studies" is designed to be
               interdisciplinary and practical, with an emphasis on learning through "hands-on"
               experience. It is a computer course, but not a course in which you learn programming
               for the sake of learning a programming language. It's a course that will involve
               programming, and working with coding languages, and "putting things online," but it's
               not a course designed to make you, in fifteen weeks, a professional website designer.
               Instead, this is a course in which we prioritize what we can investigate in the
               Humanities and related Social Sciences fields about cultural, historical, and
               literary research questions through applications in computer coding and programming,
               which you will be learning and applying as you go in order to make new discoveries
               and transform cultural objects—what we call "texts" in their complex and multiple
               dimensions. We think of "texts" as the transmittable, sharable forms of human
               creativity (mainly through language), and we interface with a particular text in
               multiple ways through print and electronic "documents." When we refer to a
               "document," we mean a specific instance of a text, and much of our work will be in
               experimenting with the structures of texts in digital document formats, accessing
               them through scripts we write in computer code—scripts that in themselves are a kind
               of text, readable both by humans and machines. </p>
            <p>Your professors are scholars and teachers of humanities, not computer programmers by
               trade, and we teach this course from our backgrounds (in literature and anthropology,
               respectively). We teach this course to share coding methods that are highly useful to
               us in our fields, with an emphasis on working with texts as artifacts of human
               culture shaped primarily with words and letters—the forms of "written" language
               transferable to many media (including image and sound) that we can study with
               computer modelling tools that we design for ourselves based on the questions we ask.
               We work with computers in this course as precision instruments that help us to read
               and process great quantities of information, and that lead us to make significant
               connections, ask new kinds of questions, and build models and interfaces to change
               our reading and thinking experience as people curious about human history, culture,
               and creativity. </p>
            <p>Our focus in this course is primarily analytical: to apply computer technologies to
               represent and investigate cultural materials. As we design projects together, you
               will gain practical experience in editing and you will certainly fine-tune your
               precision in writing and thinking. We will be working primarily with eXtensible
               Markup Language (XML) because it is a powerful tool for modelling texts that we can
               adapt creatively to our interests and questions. XML represents a standard in
               adaptability and human-readability in digital code, and it works together with
               related technologies with which you will gain working experience: You'll learn how to
               write XPath expressions: a formal language for searching and extracting information
               from XML code which serves as the basis for transforming XML into many publishable
               forms, using XSLT and XQuery. You'll learn to write XSLT: a programming "stylesheet"
               transforming language designed to convert XML to publishable formats, as well as
               XQuery, a query (or search) language for extracting information from XML files
               bundled collectively. You will learn how to design your own systematic coding methods
               to work on projects, and how to write your own rules in schema languages (like
               Schematron and Relax-NG) to keep your projects organized and prevent errors. You'll
               gain experience with an international XML language called TEI (after the Text
               Encoding Initiative) which serves as the international standard for coding digital
               archives of cultural materials. Since one of the best and most widely accessible ways
               to publish XML is on the worldwide web, you'll gain working experience with HTML code
               (a markup language that is a kind of XML) and styling HTML with Cascading Stylesheets
               (CSS). We will do all of this with an eye to your understanding how coding works—and
               no longer relying without question on expensive commercial software as the "only"
               available solution, because such software is usually not designed with our research
               questions in mind. </p>
            <p>We think you'll gain enough experience at least to become a little dangerous, and at
               the very least more independent as investigators and makers who wield computers as
               fit instruments for your own tasks. Your success will require patience, dedication,
               and regular communication and interaction with us, working through assignments on a
               daily basis. Your success will NOT require perfection, but rather your regular
               efforts throughout the course, your documenting of problems when your coding doesn't
               yield the results you want. Homework exercises are a back-and-forth, intensive
               dialogue between you and your instructors, and we plan to spend a great deal of time
               with you individually over these as we work together. Our guiding principle in
               developing assignments and working with you is that the best way for you to learn and
               succeed is through regular practice as you hone your skills. Our goal is not to make
               you expert programmers (as we are far from that ourselves)! Rather, we want you to
               learn how to manipulate coding technologies for your own purposes, how to track down
               answers to questions, how to think your way algorithmically through problems and find
               good solutions.</p>

                  Each day will involve some small assignment, building to the larger course
                  projects. Students must complete (on time) at least 90% of each homework component
                  (coding assignments, short response papers, blog postings and responses, in order
                  to pass the course. For students who complete the 90% requirement, the homework
                  taken all together, is worth 35% of your course grade.</p>
               <div type="coding">
                  <p><hi rend="em">Coding assignments:</hi> These are assignments you'll complete by
                     writing code to achieve a specified result by applying a coding method you are
                     learning. Often, there will be multiple ways of accomplishing the task. You
                     will receive lots of feedback from us, in the form of posted results and
                     individual commentary on your assignments as needed. If you don't achieve the
                     result you want, you may still receive full credit so long as you have made a
                     serious attempt to describe your process, what else you tried, what results you
                     expected vs. what results you got, and what you think went wrong. Documenting
                     problems is key to the learning process, and sometimes the documentation
                     process helps lead you to the solution and always helps your learning

                     humanities web projects and resources. Your response should do more than
                     summarize the article or site (which you could just do by skimming or reading
                     the first paragraph), but should demonstrate a thoughtful reflection on
                     specific ideas and issues. When evaluating a web resource, don't simply praise
                     or condemn it without going into details about why a key component is effective
                     or poorly designed. Good response papers demonstrate care and reflection, and
                     you may choose to respond to the overarching ideas of a piece, or to selected

                     postings should be brief status reports about your project work: what you've

                     been learning, resources you've been discussing, and should conclude by

               <p> Coding and programming in real life is a social activity, and professionals in
                  the real world aren't "know-it-all" experts who work alone, but rather are tuned
                  into discussion boards and regularly ask and answer questions to stay sharp and to
                  learn from their community. In this class, we want you to work together and talk
                  to each other and your instructors as your community resource, so we have built
                  this into our course participation grade as a formal expectation. <hi rend="em"
                     >Beginning by week two, we'll expect each student to post at least once per
                     week on our online class discussion board</hi>, and we strongly encourage you
                  to do more than this minimum. Ask questions, make suggestions, share helpful
                  resources you've found. Help each other out by trying to answer questions (and
                  read the instructor posts too as we wade in to help). Your instructors will likely
                  be dominating the class time as we model concepts and methods, so the discussion
                  boards give you all a good space to form into a coding community to help each
                  other and reflect together. Also, if you have a question about an assignment, <hi
                     rend="em">always think of the discussion board as your first resource</hi> to
                  check for helpful hints and to post your questions, because others may have the
                  same question and answers are best shared! Of course you may e-mail us, but we
                  really prefer you go the discussion board first, and doing so is, after all, worth

                  propose a project based on a text or set of texts that interest you and suggest a
                  promising research question to explore with our coding methods, and we'll respond
                  to these to help you refine your ideas. We'll ask you all to read each other's
                  refined proposals, and the class as a whole (working with the instructors) will
                  select which of these we want to pursue through the term, and form groups to begin
                  work. Development of the project will involve doing a careful document analysis,
                  developing a coding plan and rules to follow, coding your text(s), and developing
                  programs to address your research question. It will also involve designing a
                  project site to represent your research questions, the texts and your processing
                  of them, as well as to share your coding scripts and to reflect on the results of
                  your investigation. We will post milestones you must meet for the projects
                  throughout the term. Project teams must meet 90% of the project milestone due
                  dates in order to receive a passing grade. It is expected that project teams meet
                  regularly (each week), check in with the instructors, and delegate tasks to each
                  other. Reporting on project progress is required as part of the regular homework
                  assignments for the course. Teams are encouraged to meet with us instructors
                  during (or outside) our scheduled office hours. In the last few weeks of the
                  course, almost all of your course work outside class will be devoted to project
                  development, applying the methods you've been learning across the semester.</p>

               <p> Your daily homework for this course is time-sensitive! Coding assignments,
                  response papers, and other homework exercises must be uploaded to CourseWeb (or to
                  Box, or the Sandbox server as specified), by the date and time indicated by the
                  instructors. Homework assignments will be posted online to our class DHDS website
                  and linked from our schedule, so students who miss class are nevertheless expected
                  to consult the schedule and submit assignments on time. Because we post and share
                  answers to homework exercises after submission deadlines, we will not accept late
                  homework submissions. In order to pass the course, students must submit at least
                  90% of the regular homework assignments, and complete at least 90% of the work in
                  each component of the course.</p>

               <p>Our class is fast paced, and requires that we all be making the best use we can of
                  our in-person class sessions. Arriving late and leaving early disrupts the
                  important collective mental activity of class. So does in-class texting and
                  checking your cell phone. While class is in progress, talking disruptively,
                  leaving the classroom, texting or using a cell phone or computer, reading a
                  newspaper, or other distracting behavior will be actively discouraged, and may
                  result in a deduction in your Participation grade. Please respect what we do in
                  the classroom: attend class regularly, and come prepared to contribute your

               <p>Each student is issued a University email address (username@pitt.edu) upon
                  admission. This email address may be used by the University for official
                  communication with students. Students are expected to read email sent to this
                  account on a regular basis. Failure to read and react to University communications
                  in a timely manner does not absolve the student from knowing and complying with
                  the content of the communications. The University provides an email forwarding
                  service that allows students to read their email via other service providers
                  (e.g., Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo). Students who choose to forward their email from their
                  pitt.edu address to another address do so at their own risk. If email is lost as a
                  result of forwarding, it does not absolve the student from responding to official
                  communications sent to their University email address. To forward email sent to
                  your University account, go to http://accounts.pitt.edu, log into your account,
                  click on Edit Forwarding Addresses, and follow the instructions on the page. Be

               <p><hi rend="em">Source Citation and Plagiarism:</hi> One goal of our course is to
                  reflect on how best to cite sources in digital contexts. We will consider how and
                  why such citations differ from documenting printed texts. We will also consider
                  the ease and frequency with which digital texts and graphics are plagiarized on
                  the worldwide web, and discuss how the omission of source citations detracts from
                  the authority of a digital information resource. We expect you to practice mindful
                  source citation, and plagiarism on your part will have very serious
                  consequences.</p>
               <p>Plagiarism falsely represents another source’s words or ideas as your own, and, if
                  you commit plagiarism in this course, you will receive a final course grade of F
                  and be reported to the Vice President of Academic Affairs. Representing the voice
                  of another individual as your own voice constitutes plagiarism, however generous
                  that person may be in “helping” you with an assignment. Turning in an assignment
                  generated collectively under the name of a single individual is considered
                  plagiarism. <hi rend="em">When instructed to collaborate on a project, project
                     collaborators share collective authorship and should identify themselves
                     directly as a team.</hi> To avoid plagiarism, cite your sources whenever you
                  quote, paraphrase, or summarize material, or use digital images from any outside
                  source (including websites, articles, books, course readings, Courseweb postings,
                  or someone else’s notes). When using the “copy” and “paste” features as you read
                  and research, be sure that you are carefully marking that these passages are
                  unprocessed from their source, so that you know to process it later. Forgetting to
                  do so not only produces sloppy work but (whether you intended it or not) results
                  in a false representation. As long as you make a good faith and clear effort to
                  cite your sources, you will not be faulted for plagiarism, but your work will be
                  penalized if citations are inaccurate, unclear, or lack important information.
                  Cheating on exams or exercises will also receive a final course grade of F and
                  will be reported to the Vice President of Academic Affairs.</p>

                              >Emily Dickinson</ref>. This site was cobbled together rapidly last
                           spring to share with students in my Pre-20th-century American Lit class,
                           to complement what they were reading in the course anthology of
                           Dickinson's poems. It was also repurposed from an older site whose
                           JavaScript stopped functioning. Note: a fascicle is a bundle of poems,
                           and at least one of the poems here is a variant version from another
                           Fascicle not represented here. What might we do to change the site's
                           representation of each poem? And what might we be able to study about
                           Dickinson's poetry by developing our markup?</item>
