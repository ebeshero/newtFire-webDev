                                 Cultures Site</a>: This is a complicated site, so you may want to
                              choose just one aspect of it (voyage narratives, mapping, graphs and
                              charts of cultural responses, reading interface, etc.) to address.

                                 digital humanities projects—it was our starting point and first

                           <li><a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~ebb8/EmilyDickinson16/1601.html">Emily Dickinson</a>. This site was cobbled together rapidly aboutto share with students in my Pre-20th-century American Lit class,
                              to complement what they were reading in the course anthology of
                              Dickinson's poems. It was also repurposed from an older site whose
                              JavaScript stopped functioning. Note: a fascicle is a bundle of poems,
                              and at least one of the poems here is a variant version from another
                              Fascicle not represented here. What might we do to change the site's
                              representation of each poem? And what might we be able to study about
                              Dickinson's poetry by developing our markup?
