      <h1><span class="banner">JavaScript Exercise 3</span></h1>
      				
      <p>We have been working with a table of nineteenth-century labor survey results from <a href="http://nelson.newtfire.org/">the Nell Nelson project</a> in our XSLT and SVG units, and we return to it now to integrate HTML with SVG, JavaScript, and CSS. This assignment will give you experience with designing a project HTML page to host SVG together with HTML, and to integrate information from an SVG chart with information retrieved on-click from an HTML table. In the process, you’ll return to the “drawing board” to output your HTML and SVG afresh, with a plan for setting attributes and elements for users to interact with in JavaScript. You will be reviewing much of what you have learned in this course and gaining experience we hope you will also apply to your project design work.</p>
      <h3>Your Task</h3>
      <p>We began here, with a TEI XML file we created by transcribing this table, using feature structures markup in the TEI:</p>
      <img src="originalWSGAch1_table.jpg" alt="19th-century labor survey from Nell Nelson project"/>
      <p>Our goal has been to produce a readable web interface to make this table data more accessible to interested readers. We are now ready to work in stages from our TEI XML to produce something like <a href="WSGA_Web.html">this webpage with incorporated SVG and JavaScript</a>. Our SVG on this page is pulled from a student homework assignment from the Fall 2015 class, and we have worked on fitting the SVG with HTML elements. You need not produce exactly the same design we did, but we ask that with this assignment you accomplish the following:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Download and work with <a href="WSGATableCh1Num.xml">this slightly modified TEI XML file</a> we have created from the 19th-century labor survey data. We have added <code>@xml:id</code> attributes to the <code>&lt;fs&gt;</code> elements to simplify the identification of the survey question and answers.</li>
         <li>Revisit your XSLT that produced HTML, and your XSLT that produced SVG, and rethink how to output your work, so you can use the new <code>@xml:id</code> attributes, but more importantly so that you can find a way to associate the HTML table information you output with the JavaScript on the page. We did this by making each bar on the stacked SVG bar graph respond on click by revealing its associated table row of survey response data, which we had started by hiding from view. You might choose to do something different, perhaps to show or hide the bars on the SVG plot, and associate them with table information. However you decide to do this is up to you, whether you want to follow <a href="WSGA_Web.html">our model here</a> or design your own new strategy. </li>
         <li>Since SVG requires different namespace and <code>xsl:stylesheet</code> input information than HTML does, we have not found a way to integrate the two outputs in one XSLT stylesheet. We recommend, then, that you output the SVG separately, but design your XSLT for HTML to hold a designated <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element (like <code>&lt;div id="svg"&gt;</code>) to set the SVG apart and find a way to balance it in your HTML page layout with another <code>div</code> (or set of <code>div</code> elements) that you can manipulate with CSS styling together with SVG <code>@width</code>, <code>@height</code>, and <code>@viewBox</code> attributes to position on the page together in a user-friendly way. You will need to design your output SVG (using any strategy that works for you) to share space on an HTML page with table data. We recommend that you read and apply Amelia Bellamy-Royds’ tutorial on scaling SVG with <code>viewBox</code>, <code>preserveAspectRatio</code> and <code>meet</code>: <a href="https://css-tricks.com/scale-svg/">https://css-tricks.com/scale-svg/</a> </li>
         <li>Write JavaScript and associate it with your HTML page that holds SVG. Script out a series of animated events to occur on document objects on click, or on some other user interaction. To design our clickable bars, we studied and adapted <a href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/election.xhtml">Obdurodon’s clickable elections graph page</a>, and took it further to highlight a stack of bars so that on-click of a stacked bar, all of the inner elements of an SVG <code>&lt;g&gt;</code> are outlined with a red border (controlled with an SVG <code>stroke</code> property, which we wrote as a toggle in our JavaScript). To be sure, you have the benefit of our JavaScript to work on this assignment, but we had to do some unsuual things to make it work and your reverse-engineering our code is fine with us, so long as you achieve results of your own, distinct in some way from ours.</li>
