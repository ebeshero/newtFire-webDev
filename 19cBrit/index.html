            <h2>Course Description</h2>
            
            
            <p>This course in literary history spans a busy century in Britain from the 1790s to
               about 1900, a time of revolutionary transformation and rapid technological
               development. We’ll learn about the emergence of Britain’s Romantic Movement in its
               revolutionary historical context, and observe Romanticism’s lasting influence on the
               writers of the Victorian era, named for the long reign of Britain’s Queen Victoria.
               Writers of this time witnessed the development of public education systems and the
               transformation of publishing technology to accommodate increasing numbers of literate
               readers in England and across the expanding British empire. Aspiring poets and
               novelists vied with each other to reach larger and larger markets. Many British
               writers took seriously the idea that literature could help connect the rich and the
               poor, and their writings address very serious social issues of the rapidly
               modernizing nineteenth century. 
            </p>
            
            <p>These writers still speak to issues of our times. They addressed controversies
               surrounding poverty, race relations, and women’s rights. They responded to scientific
               debates over geological discoveries, as well as new theories of sexual selection and
               survival of the fittest. They questioned humanity’s relation to nature, the way
               emotions influence thinking, and what might happen to Britons living among people
               of
               other cultures around the world. Over the next fifteen weeks, we will be discussing
               how nineteenth-century British writers challenged the social conventions of their
               times, and how they responded to the barriers of their time between wealth and
               poverty, men and women, Britons and foreigners, nation and empire, at a time when
               that empire stretched itself thin to span the world. Along the way we’ll consider
               why
               the "antique" ideas, images, structures, and stories of nineteenth-century Britain
               are still so appealing to many of us in the twenty-first century.

         </ol>
         
         <div id="grading">
            
            <h2>Grading:</h2>
            
            <p> Your grade will be based on Class Participation/Quizzes (10%), Weekly Logs and
               Response Papers (25%), Two Projects (total: 30%), two Midterm Exams (worth 10% each),
               and
               one Final Exam (15%). At least 90% of the work for the course must be completed in
               order to receive a passing grade (C or above).
            </p>
            
            
            <h3>Class Participation and Everyday Preparation: (10%)</h3>
            
            <p>This portion of your grade reflects the extent to which you attend class regularly
               and take an active role in class discussion, contributing thoughtful questions and
               observations based on the readings, as well as responding to my questions. It will
               also include your performance on any announced and unannounced quizzes and group
               exercises I may give in class. If you keep up with the readings listed on the
               schedule, and come to class each day prepared to discuss them, you will certainly
               do well with this component.
            </p>
            
            <p> ** Note: Your attendance is vital to this course and your achievement in it. You
               may miss three classes for any reason without penalty, but your participation
               grade will be reduced for additional unexcused absences. You’ll also be missing
               information and perspective on the readings that will almost certainly affect your
               performance on assignments and exams. If you miss class, try to keep in touch with
               other members of the class to find out what you’ve missed and consult with me to
               help you catch up and to be sure you understand the material. Please note that
               quizzes and in-class activities cannot be made up outside of the classes you
               missed. 
            </p>
            
            
            
            <h3>Short Papers: (25%)</h3>
            
            <p>Fairly frequently throughout the semester, I will assign exercises and short
               (2-page) response papers.
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>Vocab/Context Logs (WLs): </strong> Submit on
               Courseweb a Log entry in which you compile and explain at least 3 to 5 unfamiliar
               words and/or contexts. Instructions:
            </p>
            
            <ol>
               
               <li>Identify and locate the word or context using a line number in a poem, or a
                  page, chapter, or section (for a web reading). Check the footnotes in your text
                  or glosses along the sides of the page. If there is no gloss or footnote, or if
                  these aren’t sufficient to understand the word or subject, record it in your
                  log to research further:
               </li>
               
               <li>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>Find the most likely definition of words from the Oxford English
                        Dictionary (Pitt Digital Library Database) that fits the passage or
                        sentence from which you excerpted it. Provide what you think is the most
                        likely and appropriate definition, quoting the relevant passages from the
                        dictionary. 
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>For an unfamiliar phrase or context, try searching in Credo Reference
                        (Pitt Digital Library Database) first before a Google search. Give a
                        clear explanation in your own words.
                     </li>
                     
                  </ul>
               </li>
               
               <li>Reflect and comment on how this word or topic fits within the part of the
                  text it’s from: Consider its use in the surrounding grammatical unit
                  (sentence), or paragraph or passage. Could there be more than one way to read
                  this? Briefly explain. Logs must be your own individual work and must not be
                  duplicated by others in the class. (See the section on Academic Dishonesty and
                  Plagiarism below.) 
               </li>
               
            </ol>
            
            <p><strong>Response Papers (RPs): </strong> (typically 2 pages long) are designed
               to help you grapple with some challenging dimensions of our course readings, and
               should help you to strengthen your comprehension. They may also give you topic
               ideas for the major papers. Response Papers should follow MLA formatting and
               citation guidelines (as needed). Exercises and RPs lose points for lateness.
            </p>
            
            
            
            <h3>Two Projects: (15% each, for a total of 30%)</h3>
            
            <p>Over the course of the semester, you will work on two projects (about 5 - 8 pages
               of writing for each) involving close analysis and research of our course readings.
               Detailed assignments for each project will be distributed in class. Late project
               submissions will drop one grade notch (for example, from B to B-) for each day
               late.
            </p>
            
            
            
            <h3>Two Midterm Exams (10% each) and a Final Exam (15%):</h3>
            
            <p>The exams may consist of essay questions, identifications of passages, and brief
               responses regarding significant events and literary terms we have discussed in
               class. The Midterm will cover material from the first half of the course. The
               Final Exam, given during Finals Week, will have a comprehensive section, but will
               focus on material from the second half of the course. 
            </p>
            
            
            
            <h3>Grading Scale:</h3>
            
            <p>Grades are posted on Courseweb, and follow this standard scale: A: 93-100%, A-:
               90-92%, B+: 87-89%, B: 83-86%, B-: 80-82%, C+: 77-79%, C: 73-76%, C-: 70-72%, D+:
               67-69%, D: 60-66%, F: 59% and below. In taking the course on a S / NC (pass-fail)
               basis, students must earn a C to receive Satisfactory credit. G grades
               (incomplete) may be given only in conformity with the University of Pittsburgh at
               Greensburg's Bulletin: <a href="http://www.bulletins.pitt.edu/greensburg/upg-academicpolicies.htm">http://www.bulletins.pitt.edu/greensburg/upg-academicpolicies.htm</a>.

            <h3>Classes and Readings:</h3>
            
            <p>This class is fast paced with very challenging reading. To do well in this course
               it is vital that you attend class regularly and keep up with the readings! <strong>Read all the material assigned before class on the day it is
                  scheduled</strong> so that you can discuss the material in class, raise questions
               about it, and intelligently respond to my questions and comments. <strong>Stay alert for any changes to the class schedule</strong>, which I will announce
               in class and online on Courseweb and e-mail. 
            </p>
            
            
            
            <h3>Classroom Courtesy:</h3>
            
            <p>Our class is fast paced, and requires that we all be making the best use we can of
               our in-person class sessions. Arriving late and leaving early disrupts the
               important collective mental activity of class. So does in-class texting and
               checking your cell phone. While class is in progress, talking disruptively,
               leaving the classroom, texting or using a cell phone or computer, reading a
               newspaper, or other distracting behavior will be actively discouraged, and may
               result in a deduction in your Participation grade. Please respect what we do in
               the classroom: attend class regularly, and come prepared to contribute your
               questions and ideas.
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>When an assignment is due,</strong> I expect that you will carefully
               edit and proofread your documents, and that you will turn in your assignments on
               time at the beginning of class or by the posted deadline for Courseweb
               assignments. If you need an extension, ask me courteously at least a day ahead of
               time. Do not ask for an extension on or after the day the paper is due.
            </p>
            
            
            
            <h3>Academic Dishonesty and Plagiarism:</h3>
            
            <p><strong>Plagiarism</strong> falsely represents another source’s words or ideas
               as your own, and, if you commit plagiarism in this course, you will receive a
               final course grade of F and be reported to the Vice President of Academic Affairs.
               Representing the voice of another individual as your own voice constitutes
               plagiarism, however generous that person may be in "helping" you with an
               assignment. <strong>To avoid plagiarism,</strong> cite your sources whenever you
               quote, paraphrase, or summarize material, or use digital images from any outside
               source (including websites, articles, books, course readings, Courseweb postings,
               or someone else’s notes). Turning in an assignment generated collectively under
               the name of a single individual is considered plagiarism. When instructed to
               collaborate on a project, project collaborators share collective authorship and
               should identify themselves directly as a team. When using the "copy" and "paste"
               features as you read and research, be sure that you are carefully marking that
               these passages are unprocessed from their source, so that you know to process it
               later. Forgetting to do so not only produces sloppy work but (whether you intended
               it or not) results in a false representation. As long as you make a good faith and
               clear effort to cite your sources, you will not be faulted for plagiarism, but
               your work will be penalized if citations are inaccurate, unclear, or lack
               important information. <strong>Cheating</strong> on exams or exercises will also
               receive a final course grade of F and be reported to the Vice President of
               Academic Affairs.

            <h3>Turning in Assignments: Courseweb Upload</h3>
            
            <p> Turn in your papers <strong>by electronic upload through Courseweb</strong>.
               We will be using the <strong>SafeAssign</strong> feature built into Courseweb
               as a stable, time-stamped electronic archive for your papers.  <span class="smaller">Note: In a
                  crisis situation, you may send your paper to me by e-mail as an attachment,
                  but you must follow up with me to be sure I received it, if you have not
                  received a response from me in 24 hours!</span>

            <h3>E-mail Correspondence: </h3>
            
            <p>Send e-mail to me when you have questions or want to meet with me, but <strong>please identify yourself by name (first and last), and provide a
                  Subject Line</strong> when you do so. I prefer you <strong>do not submit
                  your papers to me by e-mail</strong>; see directions above for submitting
               assignments in print and online. 
            </p>
            
            <p>Each student is issued a University email address (username@pitt.edu) upon
               admission. This email address may be used by the University for official
               communication with students. Students are expected to read email sent to this
               account on a regular basis. Failure to read and react to University
               communications in a timely manner does not absolve the student from knowing and
               complying with the content of the communications. The University provides an
               email forwarding service that allows students to read their email via other
               service providers (e.g., Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo). Students who choose to forward
               their email from their pitt.edu address to another address do so at their own
               risk. If email is lost as a result of forwarding, it does not absolve the
               student from responding to official communications sent to their University
               email address. To forward email sent to your University account, go to
               http://accounts.pitt.edu, log into your account, click on Edit Forwarding
               Addresses, and follow the instructions on the page. Be sure to log out of your
               account when you have finished. (For the full Email Communication Policy, go to
