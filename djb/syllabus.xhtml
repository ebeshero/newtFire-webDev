                <h2>All the Tools You Need As We Begin:</h2>
                <p>Download and install the following software on your own personal computer(s) on
                    or before the first day of class. These software tools are available in our
                    campus computing labs, too. </p>
                <ol>

                    <li>
                        <strong>All students:</strong>
                        <a href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/">&lt;oXygen/&gt;</a>. The University of
                        Pittsburgh has purchased a site license for this software, which is
                        installed in the Pitt computer labs on multiple campuses, and it's in use in
                        courses here at Greensburg and at Oakland. The license also permits students
                        enrolled in the course to install the software on their home computers (for
                        course-related use only). When installing this on your own computers,
                            <strong>you will need the license key</strong>, which we have posted on
                        our course Announcements section of <a href="https://courseweb.pitt.edu"
                            >Courseweb</a>. </li>

                    <li>All students require a good means of secure file transfer (SFTP) for
                        homework assignments and projects (also available in the campus computer
                        labs). There are several good options available. We recommend you download
                        and install on your own computers one (or more) of the following, depending
                        on your platform: (Feel free to experiment with these and others!) <ul>

                    <li>This course fulfills general education requirements in Q2, NS, SS, and HM,
                        and it fulfills a core requirement for <a
                            href="http://greensburg.pitt.edu/academics/info/digital-studies">the
                            Digital Studies Certificate at Pitt-Greensburg</a>. Think about where
                        this course might fit in your academic career, and how you might apply the
                        skills you learn here. </li>

                    <li>No coding experience? Don't worry! You are in very good company. We don't
                        expect any of you to have written a line of computer code before now. Past
                        students in this course who never saw anything like markup or XML code have
                        designed projects (<a href="http://newtfire.org/dh/studentProjects.html"
                            >like these</a>) and even spoken about them at an undergraduate
                        conference! You'll help continue some of these projects we've started, and
                        you'll learn to build and create digital tools for yourself with skills we
                        hope you will keep developing. </li>

                                <li><strong>First XML exercise:</strong> Look at this recipe for <a
                                        href="http://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/gazpacho"
                                        >gazpacho soup</a>. What if you were running a restaurant
                                    and needed to create a system to file it according to
                                    ingredients to purchase, to track quantities per unit
                                    serving--and this recipe were one of, say, 100 other recipes
                                    you're keeping on file? Or, what if you needed to adapt it with
                                    markup to fit a system like we see at the GitHub-based recipe
                                    center <a href="http://forkthecookbook.com/"
                                        >ForktheCookbook.com</a>? Think about a good system for
                                    tagging the file for this long-term situation, and mark up your
                                    file accordingly. Experiment with this and write a complete XML
                                    file in a way that makes sense to represent the recipe, and try
                                    to make use of elements as well as attributes in your markup.
                                    There is no single way to do this exercise, but we want you to
                                    think about how you nest levels of information (elements within
                                    elements), and the relationship between elements and attributes
                                    in XML: Can the attributes hold information from the main text,
                                    perhaps removing it from the body of the text?) Submit the
