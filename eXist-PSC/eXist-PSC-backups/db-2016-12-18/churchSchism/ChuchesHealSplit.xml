       <quote ref="Hetzler"><schism>"I have friends there, but I feel a release not being there any more. My heart is in the parish where I belong now,"</schism></quote> she said.
        
        Such words come from both sides after the<schism><sec><date>Oct. 4</date> vote by the Diocese of <location>Pittsburgh</location></sec> to secede from the <sec><stat>2.1 million-member</stat><sect type="Episcopal"> Episcopal</sect> Church,</sec> one of <sec><stat>38 provinces</stat> in the <stat>80 million-member</stat><sect type="Anglican">Anglican</sect> Communion,</sec> a global body of churches that grew out of the <sec>Church of <location>England</location></sec>. The vote hinged on whether the denomination had abandoned biblical faith in matters ranging from salvation to sexuality.</schism>
        
        There is sadness over <schism>broken relationships and anger over property litigation.</schism> But relations are more amicable than in most other<schism> fractured dioceses</schism>.
        
        Both are called the <sec><sect type="Episcopal">Episcopal</sect> Diocese of <location>Pittsburgh</location></sec>, though the <schism><stat>57-parish</stat><sect type="Episcopal">Episcopal</sect> Diocese of <location>Pittsburgh</location><sect type="Anglican">(Anglican)</sect> isn't affiliated with the <sect type="Episcopal">Episcopal</sect></schism> Church.

        <schism>While <sec><who ref="Duncan">Archbishop Duncan</who> builds a <stat>100,000-member</stat> international body from scratch</sec>,<sec><who ref="Johnson">Bishop Robert Johnson </who>ministers part time to the <stat>28-parish diocese</stat> that remains in the <sect type="Episcopal">Episcopal</sect> Church.

It was like being a missionary bishop,"</quote> said <sec><who ref="Johnson">Bishop Johnson</who>, the retired bishop of <location>Western North Carolina</location>.</sec>
        When he visits parishes, <quote ref="Johnson"><schism>"I don't talk about the problems we face in this diocese unless they ask me. I find that most people are focused forward,"</schism></quote> he said.
        
        <schism>Some of those caught in the split faced painful choices.</schism><who ref="Pollard">Susan Pollard</who> believed that the <sect type="Episcopal">Episcopal</sect><schism>Church had lost its biblical moorings</schism>. <sec>But <who ref="Pollard">her</who> parish,<parish> St. Paul's</parish> in <location>Mount Lebanon</location>, remained <sect type="Episcopal">Episcopal</sect>,</sec> and <sec><who ref="Pollard">her</who><who ref="Mr. Pollard">husband</who> is a priest who assisted at <parish>St. Paul's</parish> and another <sect type="Episcopal">Episcopal</sect> parish, <sec>Christ Church</sec> in <location>Ross</location>.</sec>
        
        She felt that <parish>St. Paul's</parish> had <schism>moved too far to the theological left</schism>. She could have been happy at <parish>Christ Church</parish>, but it was too far from <sec><who ref="Pollard">their</who> home in <location>Upper St. Clair</location></sec>. She moved to <sec><parish>Trinity</parish> in <location>Washington</location></sec>, and <schism>worships in the <sect type="Anglican">Anglican</sect> diocese while her <sec><who ref="Mr. Pollard">husband</who> works in the <sect type="Episcopal">Episcopal</sect> diocese.</sec></schism><quote ref="Pollard">"St. Paul's no longer represented what we believed in. Toward the end <schism>there were people who weren't talking to me, just because my views were known to be a little more traditional,"</schism></quote> she said.
        
        Another <sec>member of <parish>St. Paul's</parish>, <who ref="Toth">Doug Toth</who>, was a trustee of the original diocese who opposed <schism>secession</schism></sec>. He said he resigned that post after learning he might be held personally liable in a <schism>lawsuit filed against the diocese by other opponents of secession.</schism> He <schism>felt threatened by his allies.</schism><quote ref="Toth">"I don't get involved any more. I go to church, I worship quietly, I keep my opinions to myself and I leave,"</quote> he said.
        
        <sec><who ref="Wilson">Jim Wilson</who>, a member of the <sect type="Anglican">Anglican</sect> diocesan council and member of the <parish>Church of the Ascension</parish> in <location>Oakland</location></sec>,<schism> reluctantly followed his bishop and parish out of the Episcopal Church.</schism> He still has lunch with old friends who are leaders in the <sect type="Episcopal">Episcopal</sect> diocese.
        
        <quote ref="Wilson">"It reminds me of the stories from World War I, where a truce was called for Christmas and soldiers from both sides met in the middle of no man's land to sing carols before they went back to shooting each other,"</quote> he said, in a reference to the lawsuit. <quote ref="Wilson">"There is <schism>tremendous personal sadness</schism>. I love those people."</quote>
        
        For diocesan leaders, litigation colors all <schism>conversations with friends on the other side</schism>, said the <sec><who ref="Stevenson">Rev. Karen Stevenson</who>, chairman of the standing committee of the <sect type="Anglican">Anglican</sect> diocese.</sec><quote ref="Stevenson">"It's <schism>hard to pursue the reconciliation that we want to have as fellow Christians</schism> because we feel we have to check with the lawyers to make sure we're not setting some precedent,"</quote> she said.
        
        Due to the litigation, the <sec>financial services firm Morgan Stanley <fact>froze diocesan trust funds</fact></sec> pending a decision by an <sec><location>Allegheny County</location> Common Pleas judge.</sec> The <sec><stat>600-member</stat><parish> Church of the Ascension</parish> was <fact>denied more than $30,000 in promised grants</fact></sec>, most of which were intended to start a mission church.
        
        <sec>Its rector, the <who ref="Millard">Rev. Jonathan Millard</who></sec>, said his members are prepared to move if they <schism>lose their building to the <sect type="Episcopal">Episcopal</sect> diocese,</schism> though they worry about what will happen to the ashes of loved ones interred in the church.
        
        <quote ref="Millard">"We've done what we believe is right and we aren't in control of the consequences," </quote>he said.
        
        <sec> The lawsuit was filed in <date>2003</date> by <parish>Calvary parish</parish> in <location>Shadyside</location>, as a <schism>pre-emptive strike against secession</schism></sec>.<sec><parish>Calvary</parish>, with<stat> 1,200 members</stat>, has grown since the split. Its rector, the <who ref="Lewis">Rev. Harold Lewis</who></sec>, admits that the <schism>split he fought</schism> to prevent has been good for <parish>Calvary</parish>.
        
        Members <quote ref="Lewis">"are occupying positions in the life of the diocese which were impossible for us before because we were on the wrong side of the <schism>ideological divide</schism>,"</quote> he said.
        
        <schism>But <sect type="Episcopal">Episcopal</sect> leaders are just as theologically conservative as the <sect type="Anglican">Anglicans</sect>.</schism> Among them is the <sec><who ref="Murph">Rev. Jeff Murph</who>, pastor of <parish>St. Thomas</parish> in <location>Oakmont</location></sec>. He <schism>lost about <fact>50 of his church's 630</fact> members, who started an <sect type="Anglican">Anglican</sect> parish in a Baptist church a few blocks away.</schism><quote ref="Murph">"There is sadness, because we love these people and have worked together with them for years,"</quote> he said. He offered to let them meet at <parish>St. Thomas</parish> or to send them out as an official "plant" of the parish. But <schism>those who left wanted a clear break with the <sect type="Episcopal">Episcopal</sect> Church.</schism><parish>St. Thomas</parish> has come through strong, and some parish events have soared in attendance. After a mission trip to New Orleans, the parish changed its pre-Ash Wednesday pancake supper to a Mardi Gras event.
        
        <quote ref="Murph">"We had jambalaya for 100 and ran out of food,"</quote> the <quote ref="Murph">Rev. Murph</quote> said.
        
        At the <schism>splinter congregation, <sec><parish>St. John the Evangelist</parish>, the <who ref="Murph">Rev. Lawrence Deihle</who></sec>still speaks glowingly of <parish>St. Thomas</parish>,</schism> where he was once an assistant.
        
        <schism><quote ref="Murph">"It came down to a different calling from God,"</quote> he said of the split.</schism>
        
        People from both churches remain in prayer groups with friends from <parish>St. Thomas</parish>. The <schism>parishes aren't competitors, but share a mission field,</schism> he said.
        
       <sec><parish>Harvest Anglican Church</parish> in <location>Homer City, Indiana County</location>,</sec> moved miles away from <schism>two parishes that its 30 members left.</schism><quote ref="Hicks">"We felt that, to have a fresh start, we should be someplace that would give us an opportunity to reach into a community that didn't already have an <sect type="Anglican">Anglican</sect> church,"</quote> said <who ref="Hicks">Deacon Homer Hicks</who>, who leads the new congregation.
        
        <quote ref="Hicks">"We've all agreed that <schism>what has happened has happened,</schism>"</quote> he said. <quote ref="Hicks">"We wish the other churches well. Christianity in this country is suffering and there is plenty of room for growth for everybody."</quote>
        
        Volunteers from <sect type="Episcopal">Episcopal</sect> parishes still cook and serve meals at <sec><parish>Shepherd's Heart</parish> in <location>Oakland</location>, a parish for the homeless that belongs to the <sect type="Anglican">Anglican</sect> diocese.</sec>
        
        A more controversial ministry is that of <sec>Trinity School for Ministry, the Ambridge seminary founded in <date>1976</date> as an evangelical alternative to more liberal <sect type="Episcopal">Episcopal</sect> seminaries.</sec> Most <schism><sect type="Episcopal">Episcopal</sect> dioceses will not send candidates there</schism>. But its graduates remain welcome here, said the <sec><who ref="Simons">Rev.

        <quote ref="Simons">"We would have no difficulty sending people there,"</quote> he said.

        <quote ref="Edwards">"When we're in chapter meetings, I call him Archbishop, because that is his title now.

        <quote ref="Gargotta">"Bishop Johnson is the right person for us. ... He understands what has transpired, and that there needs to be some healing."</quote>

        The diocese has leaders who <schism>once opposed each other</schism>, and who still disagree on matters such as<schism> gay ordination</schism>. Trust has taken time, he said.
        
        <quote ref="Deimel">"All of us are trying to figure out how to work together,"</quote> he said. <quote ref="Deimel">"I suspect that, to some degree, all sides are going to try to avoid <schism>divisive issues</schism> until we have a longer history of working with one another."</quote><sec>The <parish>Church of the Redeemer</parish> in <location>Squirrel Hill</location></sec> is a gay-friendly parish that had felt marginalized in the original diocese.
