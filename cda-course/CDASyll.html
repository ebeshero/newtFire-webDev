            <p>Download and install the following software on your own personal computer(s) on or
               before the first day of class. These software tools are available in our campus computing
               labs, too.

                  <a href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/">&lt;oXygen/&gt;</a>. The University of
                  Pittsburgh has purchased a site license for this software, which is installed in
                  the Pitt computer labs on multiple campuses, and it’s in use in courses here at
                  Greensburg and at Oakland. The license also permits students enrolled in the
                  course to install the software on their home computers (for course-related use
                  only). When installing this on your own computers, <strong>you will need the
                     license key</strong>, which we have posted on our course Announcements section of
                  <a href="https://courseweb.pitt.edu">Courseweb</a>.

               <li>All students require a good means of secure file transfer (SFTP) for homework
                  assignments and projects (also available in the campus computer labs). There are
                  several good options available. We recommend you download and install on your own
                  computers one (or more) of the following, depending on your platform: (Feel free
                  to experiment with these and others!)

                  a core requirement for <a href="http://greensburg.pitt.edu/academics/info/digital-studies">the Digital Studies Certificate at Pitt-Greensburg</a>. Think about where this course might fit in your academic career, and how you might
                  apply the skills you learn here.

               <li>No coding experience? Don’t worry! You are in very good company. We don’t expect any
                  of you to have written a line of computer code before now. Past students in this course
                  who never saw anything like markup or XML code have designed projects (<a href="http://newtfire.org/dh/studentProjects.html">like these</a>) and even spoken about them at an undergraduate conference! You’ll help continue
                  some of these projects we’ve started, and you’ll learn to build and create digital
                  tools for yourself with skills we hope you will keep developing.

                           <a href="http://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/gazpacho">gazpacho soup</a>. What if you were running a restaurant and needed to create
                           a system to file it according to ingredients to purchase, to track
                           quantities per unit serving--and this recipe were one of, say, 100 other
                           recipes you're keeping on file? Or, what if you needed to adapt it with
                           markup to fit a system like we see at the GitHub-based recipe center <a href="http://forkthecookbook.com/">ForktheCookbook.com</a>? Think
                           about a good system for tagging the file for this long-term situation,
                           and mark up your file accordingly. Experiment with this and write a
                           complete XML file in a way that makes sense to represent the recipe, and
                           try to make use of elements as well as attributes in your markup. There
                           is no single way to do this exercise, but we want you to think about how
                           you nest levels of information (elements within elements), and the
                           relationship between elements and attributes in XML: Can the attributes
                           hold information from the main text, perhaps removing it from the body of
                           the text?) Submit the results on Courseweb, in the folder labelled
                           “Upload Assignments Here”, before our next class.
