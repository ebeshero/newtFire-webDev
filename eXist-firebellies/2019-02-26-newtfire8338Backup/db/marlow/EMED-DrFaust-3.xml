It has undergone further proofing against the imaged copy available through Early English Books Online, the microfilm images, or, in some cases, against the printed copy itself. The goal has been to provide a reliable, flexible, and transparent documentary edition of this early printed witness.</p><correction><p>Some minor typographical variations, such as turned letters, are tacitly standardized. Significant typographical variations such as those caused by missorted type, although likely unintentional, are retained in the transcription in the <gi>orig</gi> reading. If judged to be typographic error, we normalize the spelling in the <gi>reg</gi> reading and indicate the intervention in textual notes.</p><p>Corrections are made to the text as provided by SHC in new <gi>orig</gi> and
<gi>reg</gi> readings, with <att>resp</att> = EMED. We document previous readings given by both the TCP and SHC, indicated by <att>resp</att> for <gi>orig</gi> and
<gi>reg</gi> readings, all presented in a <gi>choice</gi>. We have not systematically corrected the analytical attributes <att>ana</att> and <att>lemma</att> added to words with Morphadorner but we have retained them.</p></correction><normalization><p>A few typographical and orthographic features have been tacitly standardized. All instances of long 's' have been mapped to the modern form. The q-et abbreviation has been rendered as q[ue]. The single character form of "Ye" for "the" has been rendered as two characters, with the 'e' in superscript. Where possible, accents have been retained regardless of modern usage. Superscript letters are retained in the <gi>orig</gi> reading and expanded or lowered as necessary in the <gi>reg</gi> reading.</p></normalization><hyphenation><p>Hyphenation has been represented as originally printed. End-of-line hyphenation has been transcribed by EMED with a <gi>metamark</gi> in the <gi>orig</gi> reading, and the split word has been represented by two <gi>w</gi> tags. Often, the word fragments are rejoined in the first <gi>w</gi> tag in the pair as the <gi>reg</gi> reading, so the position of the regularized word is on the line where the word begins. When this would affect lineation (e.g., when the second word fragment is the only element on its line), the word is regularized in the second word fragment, on the next line.</p></hyphenation><segmentation><p>Acts, scenes, and other major textual units such as title pages, epilogues, prefaces, and other paratexts are enclosed in <gi>div</gi> tags.</p><p>Page breaks in the print witness are included in <gi>pb</gi> tags. Columns are indicated with <gi>cb</gi> tags. Line breaks are marked with <gi>lb</gi> tags. Two
<gi>lb</gi> tags in succession indicate a blank line in the printed text. Three
<gi>lb</gi> tags in succession indicate a space of greater than a line of type. No attempt has been made to further quantify blank space.</p><p>Words, spaces, and punctuation marks are enclosed in <gi>w</gi>, <gi>c</gi>, and
<gi>pc</gi> tags respectively.</p><p>Speeches are enclosed in <gi>sp</gi> tags. Speech tags usually contain a speech prefix (in the <gi>speaker</gi> tag), and an anonymous block (<gi>ab</gi>) containing the text of the speech.</p><p>Stage directions are enclosed within <gi>stage</gi> tags. They may occur within or between speeches, or occasionally in marginal notes.</p><p>Poems, songs, and letters within plays are enclosed in <gi>seg</gi> tags, with a
<att>type</att>. Segments split between speeches are linked through <att>next</att> and <att>prev</att> attributes. Some songs are prefaced with a header like "The Song", which is enclosed in a <gi>label</gi> tag.</p><p>Verse lines are not segmented within <gi>l</gi> or <gi>line</gi> elements. They are noted through line breaks and <gi>milestone</gi> elements. All typographic lines, including line breaks within prose, are also preserved.</p></segmentation><interpretation><p>Lineation is complicated by accidental features of publication. EMED documentary editions mark the line breaks as they appear in the print witness, but it is understood that other projects may wish to format the text differently. Therefore, the text itself is not enclosed in any kind of line tag. Instead, the elements of a typographic line are combined using a <gi>milestone</gi> tag. Using <gi>milestone</gi> tags allows us to maintain the lines as they are in print witness while providing flexibility. Not insignificantly, this also helps to avoid overlapping hierarchies in the XML.</p><p>The <att>ana</att> attribute of the <gi>milestone</gi> tags designate the line as
<val>verse</val> or <val>prose</val>, however these are inherited from the TCP and we do not guarantee their accuracy. Verse lines may use <att>prev</att> and <att>next</att> attributes to point to other typographic lines that complete the metrical line.</p><p>The <att>unit</att> attribute of the <gi>milestone</gi> tags can include values of
<val>wln</val> for witness line number, <val>turnunder</val> and <val>turnover</val>. Turnunders and turnovers continue the previous line in the space above or below it, and therefore inherit the line number of the line they complete. Turnunders, turnovers, and indented short lines that continue the previous metrical line are sometimes printed with a preceding bracket: these are transcribed by EMED as a <gi>metamark</gi>.</p><p>When specifying <att>who</att> attributes, we adopt aspects of the Folger Digital Text's character referencing system to deal with the known and the ambiguous. Who attributes for clearly identified speakers are composed of their mixed case name followed by the playcode. Thus, Barabas is Barabas_JoM, Tamburlaine is Tamburlaine_1Tam in Tamburlaine Part One and Tamburlaine_2Tam in Part Two, and the Citizen's wife in London Prodigal is CitizensWife_LonPro. Characters who do not have names may be identified in relation to a group of characters, expressed in capital letters. There is an attempt to develop a controlled vocabulary, so Mariners are SAILORS, Keepers are JAILERS, and Captains may be SOLDIERS. ATTENDANTS is a catch-all category that can include Lords, Gentlemen, Torchbearers, Servants, and others. If the attendant is identified as female, the catch-all term is MAIDS. A decimal-based system allows the addition of more information. Zabina's maid Ebea is MAIDS.ZABINA.Ebea_1Tam. Another maid in her retinue could be designated MAIDS.ZABINA.1_1Tam. These still refer to individual characters. For an unnamed character who is nonetheless a single, trackable individual we can use a group term followed by .1, .2 and so on. If it is not clear whether this is the same individual as someone who has appeared previously, we would use the group name followed by .X. With messengers, for example, when we are not sure if the messenger in one scene is the same as the messenger in another, we use .X as a kind of algebraic variable. MESSENGERS.1 cannot be MESSENGERS.2, but MESSENGERS.X might be.</p><p>When it is impossible to track an individual's entrances and exits, or when it is difficult to know how many characters are in the group, we prefer to track the group rather than individuals. When there is this uncertainty about who in the group is speaking, the .0 modifier is used to single out actions by a subset of the group (one or more individuals). If a single unknown person within the group speaks, that person can be identified with an extra decimal number, e.g. ATTENDANTS.0.1. For example, if a group of ATTENDANTS enters, and one speaks, that one is identified as ATTENDANTS.0.1. If a second, different person speaks that person is ATTENDANTS.0.2. A third speech which may be any of the ATTENDANTS reverts to the wider ATTENDANTS.0 designator. </p></interpretation></editorialDecl><tagsDecl><namespace name="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><tagUsage gi="pb">Marks the beginning of a page in the print edition.
