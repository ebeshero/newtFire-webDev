    <desc cargo="Mobile Base System">The International Space Station received a new crew and a new platform for its robotic arm when STS-111 visited in June 2002. STS-111, which was the 14th shuttle mission to visit the orbital outpost, launched June 5 and landed June 19.
    
    STS-111 delivered the Expedition Five crew to the station and returned the Expedition Four crew to Earth. Space Shuttle Endeavour also delivered and the Mobile Base System, or MBS. The STS-111 astronauts also performed three spacewalks. Among the objectives completed during the spacewalks was permanent installation of the MBS onto the station and replacement of a wrist roll joint on the station's robotic arm. The STS-111 crew also unloaded supplies and science experiments from the Leonardo Multi-Purpose Logistics Module, which made its third trip to the orbital outpost.
    
    Crew consisted of Commander Kenneth Cockrell, Pilot Paul Lockhart, Mission Specialists Franklin Chang-Diaz and Philippe Perrin.</desc>
