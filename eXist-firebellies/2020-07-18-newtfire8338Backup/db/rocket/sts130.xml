    <desc cargo="Tranquility Node">Commander George Zamka led the STS-130 mission to the International Space Station aboard Endeavour. Terry Virts served as the pilot. Mission Specialists were Nicholas Patrick, Robert Behnken, Stephen Robinson and Kathryn Hire. Virts completed his first trip to space.
        
        Endeavour delivered a third connecting module — the Tranquility node — to the station and a seven-windowed cupola to be used as a control room for robotics. The mission featured three spacewalks.
        STS-130 was the 32nd shuttle mission to the station.</desc>
