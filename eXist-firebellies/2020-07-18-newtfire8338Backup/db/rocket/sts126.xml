    <desc cargo="Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM)">Veteran space flier Navy Capt. Christopher J. Ferguson commanded the STS-126 mission aboard Endeavour that delivered equipment to the International Space Station that will enable larger crews to reside aboard the complex. Air Force Lt. Col. Eric A. Boe served as the pilot. The mission specialists were Navy Capt. Stephen G. Bowen, Army Lt. Col. Robert S. Kimbrough, Navy Capt. Heidemarie M. Stefanyshyn-Piper and NASA astronauts Donald R. Pettit and Sandra H. Magnus.
        
        Magnus remained on the station, replacing Expedition 17/18 Flight Engineer Gregory E. Chamitoff, who returned to Earth with the STS-126 crew.
        
        Endeavour carried a reusable logistics module that held supplies and equipment, including additional crew quarters, additional exercise equipment, equipment for the regenerative life support system and spare hardware.
        
        STS-126 was the 27th shuttle mission to the International Space Station.</desc>
