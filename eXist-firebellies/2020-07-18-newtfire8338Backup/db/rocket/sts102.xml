    <desc cargo="Leonardo Multi-Purpose Module">Space Shuttle Discovery spent almost 13 days in orbit, with nearly nine of those days docked to the International Space Station. While at the orbital outpost, the STS-102 crew attached the Leonardo Multi-Purpose Logistics Module, transferred supplies and equipment to the station, and completed two space walks.
    
    Discovery delivered the Expedition Two crew — Commander Yury Usachev and Flight Engineers Jim Voss and Susan Helms — for its extended stay aboard the space station. It returned to Earth with Expedition One Commander Bill Shepherd, Flight Engineer Sergei Krikalev and Soyuz Commander Yuri Gidzenko, who had spent 4.5 months living on the station.
    
    Crew consisted of Commander James Wetherbee, Pilot James Kelly, Mission Specialists Andrew S. W. Thomas and Paul Richards.</desc>
