    <desc cargo="none">In December 1999, Space Shuttle Discovery spent eight days in orbit on a mission to service the Hubble Space Telescope. Two teams of space walkers spent more than 24 hours conducting extravehicular activities, or EVAs, installing new equipment and performing other maintenance tasks to upgrade the space-based observatory.
    
    The seven-member crew was commanded by Curtis Brown and piloted by Scott Kelly. Jean-Francois Clervoy was the primary robotic arm operator, and the four space walkers were Mike Foale, John Grunsfeld, Claude Nicollier and Steve Smith. Clervoy and Nicollier represented the European Space Agency.</desc>
