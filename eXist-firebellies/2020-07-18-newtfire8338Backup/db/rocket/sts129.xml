Mission specialists were Robert Satcher, Michael Foreman, Randy Bresnik and Leland Melvin. Wilmore, Satcher and Bresnik made their first trips to space.
        
        The mission returned station crew member Nicole Stott to Earth. STS-129 was the final space shuttle crew rotation flight to or from the space station.
        
        Atlantis delivered parts to the space station, including a spare gyroscope. The mission featured three spacewalks.
        
        STS-129 was the 31st shuttle mission to the station.</desc>
