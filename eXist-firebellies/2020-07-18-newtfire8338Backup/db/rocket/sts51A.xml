    <desc cargo="TESESAT-H, SYNCOM IV-I">The Canadian communications satellite TELESAT-H (ANIK), attached to Payload Assist Module-D (PAM-D) was deployed into geosynchronous orbit on flight day two. On the third day, the defense communications satellite SYNCOM IV-I (also known as LEASAT-1) was deployed. Allen and Gardner, wearing jet-propelled manned maneuvering units, retrieved two malfunctioning satellites: PALAPA-B2 and WESTAR-VI, both of these satellites were deployed on Mission 41-B. Fisher operated the remote manipulator system, grappling satellites and depositing them in the payload bay. Middeck payloads for this mission were: Diffusive Mixing of Organic Solutions (DMOS), and Radiation Monitoring Equipment (RME).
    
    Crew consisted of Commander Frederick H. Hauck, Pilot David M. Walker, Mission Specialists Anna L. Fisher, Dale A. Gardner and Joseph P. Allen.</desc>
