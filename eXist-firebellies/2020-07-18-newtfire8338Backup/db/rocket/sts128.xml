Also serving aboard Discovery were mission specialists Patrick Forrester, José Hernández, John "Danny" Olivas, Christer Fuglesang, Nicole Stott and Timothy Kopra.
        
        Stott remained on the station as an Expedition 20 flight engineer replacing Timothy Kopra. Kopra returned home aboard Discovery as a mission specialist.
        
        Discovery carried the Leonardo Multi-Purpose Logistics Module containing life support racks and science racks. The Lightweight Multi-Purpose Experiment Support Structure Carrier was also launched in Discovery's payload bay.
        
        This was Discovery's 37th mission to space and the 30th mission of a space shuttle dedicated to the assembly and maintenance of the International Space Station.</desc>
