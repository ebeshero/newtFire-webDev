                  with grown perch for bait. You look into his pail with wonder as into a summer
                  pond, as if he kept summer locked up at home, or knew where she had retreated.
                  How, pray, did he get these in mid-winter? O, he got worms out of rotten logs
                  since the ground froze, and so he caught them. His life itself passes deeper in
                  Nature than the studies of the naturalist penetrate; himself a subject for the
                  naturalist. The latter raises the moss and bark gently with his knife in search of
                  insects; the former lays open logs to their core with his axe, and moss and bark
                  fly far and wide. He gets his living by barking trees. Such a man has <app xml:id="walc16-app-0020">

                        off over an area of several acres with various kinds of scrapers drawn by
                        horses. Two followed with a horse &amp; a slight cutter, one carefully
                        leading the horse while the other guided the cutter within a few inches of a
                        rope drawn straight across the ice for 10 or a dozen rods. Such a groove was
                        made on two sides of a parallelogram. Then with various kinds of gage
                        cutters, that is cutters connected by a frame with parallel smooth or
                        toothless plates <add>at a proper distance</add> on one or both sides,
                        running in the last made groove the whole area was finally grooved in
                        squares 22 inches on a side, yet not so weakened but that horses could work
                        on it. I was told that the best ice cutters or plows cost over a hundred
                        dollars, and cut 4 inches at a bout but it was hard work for a horse. Other
                        men were employed with whipsaws cutting this area into long strips the width
                        of a cake; half a dozen poling the strips along a narrow canal to the
                        loading place—near which one stood with a spade-like chisel to cut off the
                        "cakes," which consisted of two squares &amp; therefore measured 22 by 44
                        inches. These cakes were to be finally divided by the shallow groove at the
                        loading aboard ship, so that one man might handle them. At the end of the
                        canal were a dozen or 15 men half on each side incessantly hauling the cakes
                        up a narrow iron framework or railway, sunk at one end on wood and resting
                        on a sled at the other, with pike staffs which had a double point, one bent
                        for hauling, the other straight for pushing. Each sled held 14 or 15 cakes
                        which weighed about 2 tons and were drawn by one horse over the ice to the

                  village street, and lies there for a week like a great emerald, an object of
                  interest to all passers. I have noticed that a portion of Walden which in the
                  state of water was green will often, when frozen, appear from the same point of
                  view blue. So the hollows about this pond will, sometimes, in the winter, be
                  filled with a greenish water somewhat like its own, but the next day will have
                  frozen blue. Perhaps the blue color of water and ice is due to the light and air
                  they contain, and the most transparent is the bluest.</seg>
