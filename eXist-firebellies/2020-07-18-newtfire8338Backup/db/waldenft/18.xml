               </app> see far inland the banks which the stream anciently washed, before science
               began to record its freshets. Every one has heard the story which has gone the rounds
               of New England, of a strong and beautiful bug which came out of the dry leaf of an
               old table of apple-tree wood, which had stood in a farmer’s kitchen for sixty years,
               first in Connecticut, and afterward in Massachusetts,—from an egg deposited in the
               living tree many years earlier still, as appeared by counting the annual layers
               beyond it; which was heard gnawing out for several weeks, hatched perchance by the
               heat of an urn. Who does not feel his faith in a resurrection and immortality
               strengthened by hearing of this? Who knows what beautiful and winged life, whose egg
               has been buried for ages under many concentric layers of woodenness in the dead dry
               life of society, deposited at first in the alburnum of the green and living tree,
               which has been gradually converted into the semblance of its well-seasoned
               tomb,—heard perchance gnawing out now for years by the astonished family of man, as
               they sat round the festive board,—may unexpectedly come forth from amidst society’s
               most trivial and handselled furniture, to enjoy its perfect summer life at last! </p>
