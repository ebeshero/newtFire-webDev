                  Well-Meadow,<anchor type="hn" xml:id="hn-15-028"/> now from the Baker Farm. For a long time he stood

               his place and listened to the hounds. Still on they came, and now the near woods resounded through all
               their aisles with their demoniac cry. At length the old hound burst into view with muzzle to the ground,
               and snapping the air as if possessed, and ran directly to the rock; but spying the <app xml:id="walc15-app-0111">

               in silence; and one by one her pups arrived, and, like their mother, were sobered into silence by the

               What is a country without rabbits and partridges? They are <app xml:id="walc15-app-0146">
                  <lem>among the most simple and indigenous</lem>

               creature when a rabbit or a partridge <app xml:id="walc15-app-0148">
                  <lem>bursts away,</lem>

               </app> only a natural one, as much to be expected as rustling leaves. The partridge and the rabbit are
               still sure to thrive, like true natives of the soil, whatever revolutions occur. If the forest is cut
               off, the sprouts and bushes which spring up afford them concealment, and they become more numerous than
               ever. That must be a poor country indeed that does not support a hare. Our woods teem with them both, and
               around every swamp may be seen the partridge or rabbit walk, beset with twiggy fences<anchor type="hn" xml:id="hn-15-041"/>
