               rid of them; I even felt complimented by their regarding my house as a desirable
               shelter. They never molested me seriously, though they bedded with me; and they
               gradually disappeared, into what crevices I do not know, avoiding winter<anchor type="hn" xml:id="hn-13-010"/> and unspeakable cold. </p>

               to resort to the northeast side of Walden, which the sun, reflected from the
               pitch-pine woods and the stony shore, made the fire-side of the pond; it is so much
               pleasanter and wholesomer to be warmed by the sun while you can be, than by an
               artificial fire. I thus warmed myself by the still glowing embers which the summer,
               like a departed hunter, had left.

                     <l>Thy dear, life imaging, close sympathy. </l>
                     <l>What but my hopes shot upward e’er so bright? </l>
                     <l>What but my fortunes sunk so low in night? </l>

                     <l>Was thy existence then too fanciful </l>
                     <l>For our life’s common light, who are so dull?</l>

                     <l>Did thy bright gleam mysterious converse hold </l>
                     <l>With our congenial souls? secrets too bold? </l>
                     <l>Well, we are safe and strong, for now we sit </l>
                     <l>Beside a hearth where no dim shadows flit, </l>
                     <l>Where nothing cheers nor saddens, but a fire </l>
                     <l>Warms feet and hands—nor does to more aspire; </l>
                     <l>By whose compact utilitarian heap </l>
                     <l>The present may sit down and go to sleep, </l>
                     <l>Nor fear the ghosts who from the dim past walked, </l>
                     <l>And with us by the unequal light of the old wood fire talked.”</l>
