                  As I walked in the woods to see the birds and squirrels, so I walked in the
                  village to see the men and boys; instead of the wind among the pines I heard the
                  carts rattle. In one direction from my house there was a colony of muskrats in the
                  river meadows; under the grove of elms and buttonwoods in the other horizon was a
                  village of busy men, as curious to me as if they had been prairie dogs, each
                  sitting at the mouth of its burrow, or running over to a neighbor’s to<app xml:id="walc08-app-0004">

                  Etesian winds,<anchor type="hn" xml:id="hn-08-005"/> or as if

                  through the village, to see a row of such worthies, either sitting on a ladder
                  sunning themselves, with their bodies inclined forward and their eyes glancing

                  Besides, there was a still more terrible standing invitation to call at every one
                  of these houses, and company expected about these times. For the most part I
                  escaped wonderfully from these dangers, either by proceeding at once boldly and
                  without deliberation to the goal, as is recommended to those who run the gantlet,
                  or by keeping my thoughts on high things, like Orpheus, who, “loudly singing the
                  praises of the gods to his lyre, drowned the voices of the Sirens, and kept out of
                     danger.”<anchor type="hn" xml:id="hn-08-010"/> Sometimes I
