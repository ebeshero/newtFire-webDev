               There were many such schools in the pond, apparently improving the short season before winter would draw
               an icy shutter over their broad skylight, sometimes giving to the surface an appearance as if a slight
               breeze struck it, or a few rain-drops fell there. When I approached carelessly and alarmed them, they
               made a sudden splash and rippling with their tails, as if <app xml:id="walc09-app-0259">

               wind rose, the mist increased, and the waves began to run, and the perch leaped much higher than before,
               half out of water, a hundred black points, three inches long, at once above the surface. Even as late as
               the fifth of December, <app xml:id="walc09-app-0260">

               </note>When I first paddled a boat on Walden, it was completely surrounded by thick and lofty
               pine and oak woods, and in some of its coves grape vines had run over the trees next the water and formed
               bowers under which a boat could pass. The hills which form its shores are so steep, and the woods on them
               were then so high, that, as you looked down from the west end, it had the appearance of an amphitheatre
               for some kind of sylvan spectacle. I have spent many an hour, when I was younger, floating over its
               surface as the zephyr willed, having paddled my boat to the middle, and lying on my back across the
               seats, in a summer forenoon, dreaming awake, until I was aroused by the boat touching the sand, and I
               arose to see what shore my fates had impelled me to; days when idleness was the most attractive and
               productive industry. Many a forenoon have I stolen away, preferring to spend thus the most valued part of
               the day; for I was rich, if not in money, in sunny hours and summer days, and spent them lavishly; nor do
               I regret that I did not waste more of <app xml:id="walc09-app-0276">

               similar chain of ponds through which in some other geological period it may have flowed, and by a little
               digging, which God forbid, it can be made to flow thither again. If by living thus reserved and

                        the summit of Monadnok. According to Shepherd’s "Clean Sunshine of the Gospel" the praying
                        Indian wished to make a town on this very spot, "The east side of Mr. Flint’s pond," in 1647,
                        before they finally settled at Nagog Pond on the west side of Concord. I used often to ascend
                        the cedar hill on the southeast side of this pond for the sake of the view, thence over to the
                        forest westward in which the towns are quite small, as far as the mist in the northwest horizon.

               Since the woodcutters, and the railroad, and I myself have profaned Walden, perhaps the most attractive,
               if not the most beautiful, of all our lakes, the gem of the woods, is White Pond;—a poor name from its
               commonness, whether derived from the remarkable purity of its waters or the color of its sands. In these
               as in other respects, however, it is a lesser twin of Walden. They are so much alike that you would say
               they must be connected under ground. It has the same stony shore, and its waters are of the same hue. As
               at Walden, in sultry dog-day weather, looking down through the woods on some of its bays which are not so
               deep but that the reflection from the bottom tinges them, its waters are of a misty bluish-green or
               glaucous color. Many years since I used to go there to collect the sand by cart-loads, to make
                  sand-paper
                  <anchor type="hn" xml:id="hn-09-074"/>
                with, and I have continued to visit it ever since. One who frequents it proposes to call it Virid
                  Lake.
                  <anchor type="hn" xml:id="hn-09-075"/>
                Perhaps it might be called Yellow-Pine Lake, from the following circumstance. About fifteen years
               ago you could see the top of a pitch-pine, of the kind called yellow-pine hereabouts, though it is not a
               distinct species, projecting above the surface in deep water, many rods from the shore. It was even
               supposed by some that the pond had sunk, and this was one of the primitive forest that formerly stood
               there. I find that even so long ago as 1792, in a "Topographical Description of the Town of
                  Concord,"
                  <anchor type="hn" xml:id="hn-09-076"/>
                by one of its citizens, in the Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society, the author,
               after speaking of Walden and White Ponds, adds, "In the middle of the latter may be seen, when the water
               is very low, a tree which appears as if it grew in the place where it now stands, although the roots are
               fifty feet below the surface of the water; the top of this tree is broken off, and at that place measures
               fourteen inches in diameter." In the spring of ’49 I talked with the man
                  <anchor type="hn" xml:id="hn-09-077"/>
                who lives nearest the pond in Sudbury, who told me that it was he who got out this tree ten or
               fifteen years before. As near as he could remember, it stood twelve or fifteen rods from the shore, where
               the water was thirty or forty feet deep. It was in the winter, and he had been getting out ice in the
               forenoon, and had resolved that in the afternoon, with the aid of his neighbors, he would take out the
               old yellow-pine. He sawed a channel in the ice toward the shore, and hauled it over and along and out on
               to the ice with oxen; but, before he had gone far in his work, he was surprised to find that it was wrong
               end upward, with the stumps of the branches pointing down, and the small end firmly fastened in the sandy
               bottom. It was about a foot in diameter at the big end, and he had expected to get a good saw-log, but it
               was so rotten as to be fit only for fuel, if for that. He had some of it in his shed <app xml:id="walc09-app-0319">
