               meditation. I think that I am near the end of it. Leave me alone, then, for a while. But that we may not
               be delayed, you shall be digging the bait meanwhile. Angle-worms are rarely to be met with in these
               parts, where the soil was never fattened with manure; the race is nearly extinct. The sport of digging
               the bait is nearly equal to that of catching the fish, when one’s appetite is not too keen; and this you
               may have all to yourself to-day. I would advise you to set in the spade down yonder among the
               ground-nuts, where you see the johnswort<anchor type="hn" xml:id="hn-12-012"/> waving. I think
               that I may warrant you one worm to every three sods you turn up, if you look well in among the roots of
               the grass, as if you were weeding. Or, if you choose to go farther, it will not be unwise, for I have
               found the increase of fair bait to be very nearly as the squares of the distances. </p>

                  mother, had their backs up and were fiercely spitting at me. </seg>

               round and over the pond at a considerable height, from which they could easily see to other ponds and the
               river, like black motes in the sky; and, when I thought they had gone off thither long since, they would
               settle down by a slanting flight of a quarter of a mile on to a distant part which was left free; but
               what beside safety they got by sailing in the middle of Walden I do not know, unless they love its water
