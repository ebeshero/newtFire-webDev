               </note>I set out one afternoon to go a-fishing to Fair-Haven, through the woods, to eke out my
          scanty fare of vegetables. My way led through Pleasant Meadow, an adjunct of the Baker Farm, that retreat of
          which a poet has since sung, beginning, — <lg>
                  <l>“Thy entry is a pleasant field,</l>
                  <l>Which some mossy fruit trees yield</l>
                  <l>Partly to a ruddy brook,</l>
                  <l>By gliding musquash undertook,</l>
                  <l>And mercurial trout,</l>
                  <l>Darting about.”</l>
               </lg> I thought of living there before I went to Walden. I “hooked” the apples, leaped the brook, and scared
          the musquash and the trout. It was one of those afternoons which seem indefinitely long before one, in which
          many events may happen, a large portion of our natural life, though it was already half spent when I started.
          By the way there came up a shower, which compelled me to stand half an hour under a pine, piling boughs over
          my head, and wearing my handkerchief for a shed; and when at length I had made one cast over the
          pickerel-weed, standing up to my middle in water, I found myself suddenly in the shadow of a cloud, and the
          thunder began to rumble with such emphasis that I could do no more than listen to it. The gods must be proud,
          thought I, with such forked flashes to rout a poor unarmed fisherman. So I made haste for shelter to the
          nearest hut, which stood half a mile from any road, but so much the nearer to the pond, and had long been
          uninhabited:— <lg>
                  <l>“And here a poet builded,</l>
                  <l>In the completed years,</l>
                  <l>For behold a trivial cabin</l>
                  <l>That to destruction steers.”</l>
               </lg> So the Muse fables. But therein, as I found, dwelt now John Field, an Irishman, and his wife, and
          several children, from the broad-faced boy who assisted his father at his work, and now came running by his
          side from the bog to escape the rain, to the wrinkled, sibyl-like, cone-headed infant that sat upon its
          father’s knee as in the palaces of nobles, and looked out from its home in the midst of wet and hunger
          inquisitively upon the stranger, with the privilege of infancy, not knowing but it was the last of a noble
          line, and the hope and cynosure of the world, instead of John Field’s poor starveling brat. There we sat
          together under that part of the roof which leaked the least, while it showered and thundered without. I had
          sat there many times of old before the ship was built that floated his family to America. An honest,
          hard-working, but shiftless man plainly was John Field; and his wife, she too was brave to cook so many
          successive dinners in the recesses of that lofty stove; with round greasy face and bare breast, still thinking
          to improve her condition one day; with the never absent mop in one hand, and yet no effects of it visible any
          where. The chickens, which had also taken shelter here from the rain, stalked about the room like members of
          the family, too humanized methought to roast well. They stood and looked in my eye or pecked at my shoe
          significantly. Meanwhile my host told me his story, how hard he worked “bogging” for a neighboring farmer,
          turning up a meadow with a spade or bog hoe at the rate of ten dollars an acre and the use of the land with
          manure for one year, and his little broad-faced son worked cheerfully at his father’s side the while, not
          knowing how poor a bargain the latter had made. I tried to help him with my experience, telling him that he
          was one of my nearest neighbors, and that I too, who came a-fishing here, and looked like a loafer, was
          getting my living like himself; that I lived in a tight, light, and clean house, which hardly cost more than
          the annual rent of such a ruin as his commonly amounts to; and how, if he chose, he might in a month or two
          build himself a palace of his own; that I did not use tea, nor coffee, nor butter, nor milk, nor fresh meat,
          and so did not have to work to get them; again, as I did not work hard, I did not have to eat hard, and it
          cost me but a trifle for my food; but as he began with tea, and coffee, and butter, and milk, and beef, he had
          to work hard to pay for them, and when he had worked hard he had to eat hard again to repair the waste of his
          system, — and so it was as broad as it was long, indeed it was broader than it was long, for he was
          discontented and wasted his life into the bargain; and yet he had rated it as a gain in coming to America,
          that here you could get tea, and coffee, and meat every day. But the only true America is that country where
          you are at liberty to pursue such a mode of life as may enable you to do without these, and where the state
          does not endeavor to compel you to sustain the slavery and war and other superfluous expenses which directly
          or indirectly result from the use of such things. For I purposely talked to him as if he were a philosopher,
          or desired to be one. I should be glad if all the meadows on the earth were left in a wild state, if that were
          the consequence of men’s beginning to redeem themselves. A man will not need to study history to find out what
          is best for his own culture. But alas! the culture of an Irishman is an enterprise to be undertaken with a
          sort of moral bog hoe. I told him, that as he worked so hard at bogging, he required thick boots and stout
          clothing, which yet were soon soiled and worn out, but I wore light shoes and thin clothing, which cost not
          half so much, though he might think that I was dressed like a gentleman (which, however, was not the case,)
          and in an hour or two, without labor, but as a recreation, I could, if I wished, catch as many fish as I
          should want for two days, or earn enough money to support me a week. If he and his family would live simply,
          they might all go a-huckleberrying in the summer for their amusement. John heaved a sigh at this, and his wife
          stared with arms a-kimbo, and both appeared to be wondering if they had capital enough to begin such a course
          with, or arithmetic enough to carry it through. It was sailing by dead reckoning to them, and they saw not
          clearly how to make their port so; therefore I suppose they still take life bravely, after their fashion, face
          to face, giving it tooth and nail, not having skill to split its massive columns with any fine entering wedge,
          and rout it in detail;—thinking to deal with it roughly, as one should handle a thistle. But they fight at an
          overwhelming disadvantage,—living, John Field, alas! without arithmetic, and failing so. </p>

              field I stand. Roam far and wide—grasp at life and conquer it. Learn much and live. You are really
              free—stay till late in the night—be unwise and daring. See many men far &amp; near in their fields
              &amp; cottages before the sun sets—though as if many more were to be seen—Rest not every night in
              villages nor in the same place. The noblest life is continuous and unintermitting without pauses or
              waste.</rdg>

               </note>Before I had reached the pond some fresh impulse had brought out John Field, with
          altered mind, letting go “bogging” ere this sunset. But he, poor man, disturbed only a couple of fins while I
          was catching a fair string, and he said it was his luck; but when we changed seats in the boat luck changed
          seats too. Poor John Field!— I trust he does not read this, unless he will improve by it,—thinking to live by
          some derivative old-country mode in this primitive new country,—to catch perch with shiners. It is good bait
          sometimes, I allow. With his horizon all his own, yet he a poor man, born to be poor, with his inherited Irish
          poverty or poor life, his Adam’s grandmother and boggy ways, not to rise in this world, he nor his posterity,
          till their wading webbed bog-trotting feet get <hi rend="style(italics)">talaria</hi> to their heels.</p>
