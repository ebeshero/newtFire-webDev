               as it takes to milk a cow, or longer if he pleases, to await the arrival of a guest." I often performed
               this duty of hospitality, waited long enough to milk a whole herd of cows, but did not see the man
               approaching from the town.<anchor type="hn" xml:id="hn-14-065"/>
