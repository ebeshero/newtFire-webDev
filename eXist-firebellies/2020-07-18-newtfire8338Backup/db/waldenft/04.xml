               in. I was sometimes tempted to stretch an awning over them and take my seat there. It was worth the while

               which hugs the earth is but the barb of the spear. The stabler of the iron horse was up early this winter
               morning by the light of the stars amid the mountains, to fodder and harness his steed. Fire, too, was
               awakened thus early to put the vital beat in him and get him off. If the enterprise were as innocent as
               it is early! If the snow lies deep, they strap on his snow-shoes, and with the giant plow, plow a furrow
               from the mountains to the seaboard, in which the cars, like a following drill-barrow, sprinkle all the
               restless men and floating merchandise in the country for seed. All day the fire-steed flies over the
               country, stopping only that his master may rest, and I am awakened by his tramp and defiant snort at
               midnight, when in some remote glen in the woods he fronts the elements incased in ice and snow; and <app xml:id="walc04-app-0103">

               evening, I hear him in his stable blowing off the superfluous energy of the day, that he may calm his
               nerves and cool his liver and brain for a few hours of iron slumber. If the enterprise were as heroic and
               commanding as it is protracted and unwearied! </p>

               extent of the globe. I feel more like a citizen of the world at the sight of the palm-leaf which will
               cover so many flaxen New England heads the next summer, the Manilla hemp and cocoa-nut husks, the old
               junk, gunny bags, scrap iron, and rusty nails. This car-load of torn sails is more legible and
               interesting now than if they should be wrought into paper and printed books. Who can write so graphically
               the history of the storms they have weathered as these rents have done? They are proof-sheets which need
               no correction. Here goes lumber from the Maine woods, which did not go out to sea in the last freshet,
               risen four dollars on the thousand because of what did go out or was split up; pine, spruce,
               cedar,—first, second, third and fourth qualities, so lately all of one quality, to wave over the bear,
               and moose, and caribou. Next rolls Thomaston lime, a prime lot, which will get far among the hills before
               it gets slacked. These rags in bales, of all hues and qualities, the lowest condition to which cotton and
               linen descend, the final result of dress,—of patterns which are now no longer cried up, unless it be in
               Milwaukie, as those splendid articles, English, French, or American prints, ginghams, muslins, &amp;c.,
               gathered from all quarters both of fashion and poverty, going to become paper of one color or a few
               shades only, on which forsooth will be written tales of real life, high and low, and founded on fact!
               This closed car smells of salt fish, the strong New England and commercial scent, reminding me of the
               Grand Banks and the fisheries. Who has not seen a salt fish, thoroughly cured for this world, so that
               nothing can spoil it, and putting the perseverance of the saints to the blush? with which you may sweep
               or pave the streets, and split your kindlings, and the teamster shelter himself and his lading against
               sun wind and rain behind it,— and the trader, as a Concord trader once did, hang it up by his door for a
               sign when he commences business, until at last his oldest customer cannot tell surely whether it be
               animal, vegetable, or mineral, and yet it shall be as pure as a snowflake, and if it be put into a pot
               and boiled, will come out an excellent dun fish for a Saturday’s dinner. Next Spanish hides, with the
               tails still preserving their twist and the angle of elevation they had when the oxen that wore them were
               careering over the pampas of the Spanish main,—a type of all obstinacy, and evincing how almost hopeless
               and incurable are all constitutional vices. I confess, that practically speaking, when I have learned a
               man’s real disposition, I have no hopes of changing it for the better or worse in this state of
               existence. As the Orientals say, “A cur’s tail may be warmed, and pressed, and bound round with
               ligatures, and after a twelve years’ labor bestowed upon it, still it will retain its natural form.” The
               only effectual cure for such inveteracies as these tails exhibit is to make glue of them, which I believe
               is what is usually done with them, and then they will stay put and stick. Here is a hogshead of molasses
               or of brandy directed to John Smith, Cuttingsville, Vermont, some trader among the Green Mountains, who
               imports for the farmers near his clearing, and now perchance stands over his bulk-head and thinks of the
               last arrivals on the coast, how they may affect the price for him, telling his customers this moment, as
               he has told them twenty times before this morning, that he expects some by the next train of prime
               quality. It is advertised in the Cuttingsville Times. </p>

                While these things go up
               other things come down. Warned by the whizzing sound, I look up from my book and see some tall pine, hewn
               on far northern hills, which has winged its way over the Green Mountains and the Connecticut, shot like
               an arrow through the township within ten minutes, and scarce another eye beholds it; going <quote>

               </app> bearing the cattle of a thousand hills, sheepcots, stables, and cow-yards in the air, drovers with
               their sticks, and shepherd boys in the midst of their flocks, all but the mountain pastures, whirled
               along like leaves blown from the mountains by the September gales. The air is filled with the bleating of
               calves and sheep, and the hustling of oxen, as if a pastoral valley were going by. When the old
               bell-wether at the head rattles his bell, the mountains do indeed skip like rams and the little hills
               like lambs. A car-load of drovers, too, in the midst, on a level with their droves now, their vocation
               gone, but still clinging to their useless sticks as their badge of office. But their dogs, where are
               they? It is a stampede to them; they are quite thrown out; they have lost the scent. Methinks I hear them
               barking behind the Peterboro’ Hills, or panting up the western slope of the Green Mountains. They will
               not be in at the death. Their vocation, too, is gone. Their fidelity and sagacity are below par now. They
               will slink back to their kennels in disgrace, or perchance run wild and strike a league with the wolf and
               the fox. So is your pastoral life whirled past and away. But the bell rings, and I must get off the track
               and let the cars go by;— <lg>

               </app> my clearing. No cockerels to crow nor hens to cackle in the yard. No yard! but unfenced Nature
               reaching up to your very sills. A young forest growing up under your windows, and wild sumachs and
               blackberry vines breaking through into your cellar; sturdy pitch-pines rubbing and creaking against the
               shingles for want of room, their roots reaching quite under the house. Instead of a scuttle or a blind
               blown off in the gale,—a pine tree snapped off or torn up by the roots behind your house for fuel.
               Instead of no path to the front-yard gate in the Great Snow,—no gate,—no front-yard,—and no path to the
               civilized world!</p>
