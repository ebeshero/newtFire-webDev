                  Men esteem truth remote, in the outskirts of the system, behind the farthest star, before Adam and
                  after the last man. In eternity there is indeed something true and sublime. But all these times and
                  places and occasions are now and here. God himself culminates in the present moment, and will never be
                  more divine in the lapse of all the ages. And we are enabled to apprehend at all what is sublime and
                  noble only by the perpetual instilling and drenching of the reality which surrounds us. The universe
                  constantly and obediently answers to our conceptions; whether we travel fast or slow, the track is

                           <l>In deed or in thought,</l>
                           <l>In cold or in drouth,</l>
                           <l>Not seek the sunny South,</l>
                           <l>But make the whole tour</l>
                           <l>Of the sunny Present Hour.</l>
                           <l>For here if thou fail,</l>
                           <l>Where canst thou prevail,</l>
                           <l>If you love not</l>
                           <l>Your own land most,</l>
                           <l>You’ll find nothing lovely</l>
                           <l>Upon a distant coast.</l>
                           <l>If you love not</l>
                           <l>The latest sun-set,</l>
                           <l>What is there in pictures</l>
                           <l>Or old gems set?</l>
                           <l>If no man should travel</l>
                           <l>Till he had the means,</l>
                           <l>There’d be little travelling</l>
                           <l>For Kings or for Queens.</l>
                           <l>The means! What are they?</l>
                           <l>They are the wherewithal</l>
                           <l>Great expenses to pay;—</l>
                           <l>Life got, and some to spare,</l>
                           <l>Great works on hand,</l>
                           <l>And freedom from care.</l>
                           <l>Plenty of time well spent,</l>
                           <l>To use,—</l>
                           <l>Clothes paid for, and no rent</l>
                           <l>In your shoes;—</l>
                           <l>Something to eat,</l>
                           <l>And something to burn,</l>
                           <l>And, above all, no need to return;—</l>
                           <l>For they who come back,</l>
                           <l>Say have they not failed,</l>
                           <l>Wherever they’ve ridden</l>
                           <l>Or steamed it, or sailed?</l>
                           <l> All your grass hayed,—</l>
                           <l> All your debts paid,— </l>
                           <l> All your wills made?</l>
                           <l>Then you might as well have stayed,</l>
                           <l>For are you not dead,</l>
                           <l>Only not buried?</l>
                           <l>The way unto “Today,”</l>
                           <l>The railroad to “Here,”</l>
                           <l>They never’ll grade that way,</l>
                           <l>Nor shorten it, I fear,</l>
                           <l>There are plenty of depots</l>
                           <l>All the world o’er,</l>
                           <l>But not a single station</l>
                           <l>At a man’s door;</l>
                           <l>If we would get near</l>
                           <l>To the secret of things,</l>
                           <l>We shall not have to hear</l>
                           <l>When the engine bell rings.</l>
