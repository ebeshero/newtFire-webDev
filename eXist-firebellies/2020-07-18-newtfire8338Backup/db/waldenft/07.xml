                        as slow as the pace of oxen. The difference between the ancients and us may
                        be seen in their different treatment of their fellow laborer the ox. We are
                        accustomed to say that the ox is more profitable than the horse, because it
                        not only costs less to keep it, but when it is past labor we can slaughter
                        it, and it will furnish food for our families—we treat it as a slave rather
                        than as a servant. If other nations, as the Egyptians, have been idolators
                        in this respect, and made animals objects of adoration, we have gone to the
                        other and an equally fatal extreme—for every animal should be approached
                        with a feeling of reverence.—“According to the early laws of Greece, the
                        ploughing ox was held sacred, and was entitled when past service, to range
                        the pastures in freedom and repose. It was forbidden, by decrees of
                        Triptolemus, to put to death this faithful ally of the labors of the
                        husbandman, who shared the toils of ploughing &amp; threshing. Whenever
                        therefore an ox was slaughtered, he must first be consecrated or devoted as
                        a sacrifice (<w xml:lang="gr">ίερειου</w>), by the sprinkling of the
                        sacrificial barley; this was a precaution against the barbarous practice of
                        eating raw flesh (<w xml:lang="gr">Вονφαγία</w>). A peculiar sacrifice (<w xml:lang="gr">Δμπόλια</w>) at Athens, at which a slayer of the ox fled,
                        and the guilty axe was thrown into the sea, on the sentence of the Prytanes,
                        yearly placed before the people a visible type of the first beginnings of
                        their social institutions." Ancient writers on agriculture speak of such
                        things as the “dignity of the herd." Varro suggests that the object of the
                        Argonautic expedition was a ram’s fleece—The golden apples of the Hesperides
                        were by the ambiguity of language goats and sheep which Hercules imported.
                        The stars and constellations bear their names. The Aegean sea has its name
                        from the goat—and famous mountains &amp; straits—as the Bosphorus or
                        ox-passage. Ovid makes Italy to be from <hi rend="style(underline)">vitulas</hi>. The fine or tax (mulcta a mulgendo) anciently paid in kind
                        refers to this. The oldest coins bore the figures of cattle—Our word
                        pecuniary is from the Latin pecunia which is from <hi rend="style(underline)">pecus</hi> or herd—which was the oldest currency
                        or medium of exchange. Celebrated Roman families have derived their names
                        from the same source. As Porcius

                        husbandman, who shared the toils of plowing and threshing. Whenever
                        therefore an ox was slaughtered, he must first be consecrated or devoted as
