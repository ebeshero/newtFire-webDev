                   They early introduce us to and detain us in scenery
                  with which otherwise, at that age, we should have little acquaintance. Fishermen, hunters,
                  woodchoppers, and others, spending their lives in the fields and woods, in a peculiar sense a part of
                  Nature themselves, are often in a more favorable mood for observing her, in the intervals of their
                  pursuits, than philosophers or poets even, who approach her with expectation. She is not afraid to
                  exhibit herself to them. </seg>
