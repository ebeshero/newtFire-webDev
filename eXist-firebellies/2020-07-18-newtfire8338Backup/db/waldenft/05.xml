               had time to acquire any new value for each other. We meet at meals three times a day,
               and give each other a new taste of that old musty cheese that we are. We have had to
               agree on a certain set of rules, called etiquette and politeness, to make this
               frequent meeting tolerable, and that we need not come to open war. We meet at the
               post-office, and at the sociable, and about the fireside every night; we live thick
               and are in each other’s way, and stumble over one another, and I think that we thus
               lose some respect for one another. Certainly less frequency would suffice for all
               important and hearty communications. Consider the girls in a factory,—never alone,
