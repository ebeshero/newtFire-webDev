                     <rdg wit="#wc_0d">work.<del>I remember to have met once a particularly wretched
                           man in our own streets, asking for a lodging, whom it was almost no
                           pleasure to befriend he so was hopeless. He had come all the way from New
                           York on foot, seeking work, but he did not know where he was at any time,
                           only, perchance, that he had travelled thirty miles that day, when three
                           would have done as well. He thought that he had seriously injured himself
                           by lying out, but he was more seriously injured before. He could do work
                           about a stable, but declared in a disconsolate voice, that there was no
                           work for him, as if the fates had a spite against him. I saw by his face
                           that he was only a more desperate man than usual, whose whole life was a
                           crime, who was endeavoring to escape from himself, but for once, derived
                           no amusement from the method which he had chosen. He thought that nobody
                           wished to employ him nor would respect him, because he knew that he was
                           unworthy to be employed, and did not respect himself; and thus he had
                           come two hundred and fifty miles in a straight line, with desperate
                           steps, offering himself, with a down look, anticipating failure, to do
                           stable work at such stable yards as this path happened to intersect,
                           doing his part as he would fain have believed, toward getting work; but
                           the truth was, he merely wished to convince the fates that he was willing
                           to do his part, when he was not. And so, judging from his direction, he
                           would go on, if his constitution held out, to the Gulf of St Lawrence,
                           where he would probably jump in. I knew very well that he was not the
                           only man who had not succeeded in getting work.</del>

                  my ingenuity, I thought often and seriously of picking huckleberries; that surely
                  I could do, and its small profits might suffice,—for my greatest skill has been to

                        in the summer use a grapple since fatal effects are found to follow the long
                        continued habit of handling it. Of course a great deal of work which was
                        done in advance in order to be prepared for the workmen to follow was lost,
                        and had to be done over again. Not only fresh snow had to be cropped off the
                        same area, but a rain or thaw succeeded by cold filled the grooves with ice
                        and spoiled that work; or worst of all rain &amp; snow together might cover
                        the whole pond for the whole winter many inches deep with imperfect ice
                        which must be planed off. However, they removed this very fast. The plane
                        which was as wide as a cake took off 2 inches each bout &amp; 3 horses could
                        break up as much as 10 could carry off. They used a rope with buoys to fence
                        and haul in the ice already cut when the wind blew it off shore. The ice is
                        commonly cut on the leeward side of the pond, so that the wind need not blow
                        the water over the edge into the grooves, where it would freeze and spoil
                        much work. They put snow into the ends of the grooves next the water to keep
                        it out. When it was necessary to scrape up much snow it sank the ice under
                        &amp; so impeded the work. Also the ice sank &amp; wore out where the men
                        stood on boards to load it, until the water stood above it, and the waves
                        also ate it away—so that they were obliged every day or two to occupy a new
                        place.</rdg>

                  than any he can consciously render. We demand to discover at least some signs of
                  life, some vegetation and putting forth of natural life in him. Some greenness,
                  some flowering—some ripeness. He must be a sort of appreciable wealth to us, or at
                  least make us sensible of our own riches—in his degree an Apollo—a Mercury—a
                  Ceres—a Minerva—or the bearer of divine gifts to me. He must bring me the morning
                  light untarnished, &amp; the evening red undimmed—The hilarity of Spring in his
                  mirth—the summer’s serenity in his joy—the autumnal ripeness in his wisdom—and the
                  repose and abundance of winter in his silence. A man should impart his courage and
                  not his despair—his health and ease and not his disease, and take care that this
                  does not spread by contagion. It has been well said that our purest and loftiest
                  joys have no memory of, or faith in, one another, and hence we need that he of our
                  fellows who last travelled to the sources of the sun—drank at the well of life—or
                  tasted the fountain of God—should communicate to us some of their inspiration.</ab>

               season, during the continuance of which it is fresh and blooming, and during their
               absence dry and withered; to neither of which states is the cypress exposed, being
               always flourishing; and of this nature are the azads, or religious independents.—Fix
