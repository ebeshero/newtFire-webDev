</p><p>She moved to the <church>Church of the Nativity in <location>Crafton</location></church>, but she still supports Atonement's rummage sales and collects the baby items that it gives to her favorite charity.

<quote sp="Betsy Hetzler">"I have friends there, but I feel a release not being there any more. My heart is in the parish where I belong now,"</quote> she said.
</p><p>Such words come from both sides after the <date>Oct. 4</date> vote by the Diocese of Pittsburgh to secede from the <stat>2.1 million-member <church><sect type="Episcopal"/> Church</church></stat>, one of <stat>38 provinces </stat>in the <stat>80 million-member <sect type="Anglican"/> Communion</stat>, a global body of churches that grew out of the<church> Church of England</church>. The vote hinged on whether the denomination had abandoned biblical faith in matters ranging from salvation to sexuality.
</p><p>There is sadness over broken relationships and anger over property litigation. But relations are more amicable than in most other fractured dioceses.
</p><p>Both are called the <diocese><sect type="Episcopal"/> Diocese of Pittsburgh,</diocese> though the <stat>57-parish <sec type="Episcopal"/> Diocese of Pittsburgh (<sect type="Anglican"/>)</stat> isn't affiliated with the <church><sect type="Episcopal"/> Church</church>. It is part of the newly formed <church><scet type="Anglican"/> Church in <location>North America</location></church>, whose spiritual leader is <who name="Archbishop Robert Duncan"/>, of <location>Pittsburgh</location>.

<quote sp="Archbishop Robert Duncan">"The Lord is blessing us. There aren't any glum faces around here</quote>," Archbishop Duncan said.
</p><p>While <who name="Archbishop Robert Duncan"/> builds a <stat>100,000-member international body</stat> from scratch, <who name="Bishop Robert Johnson"/> ministers part time to the <stat>28-parish diocese</stat> that remains in the <sect type="Episcopal"/> Church. It now has an office in <location>Monroeville</location>.

<quote sp="Bishop Rober Johnson">"When I arrived it was just me -- a bishop, a cell phone and a car. It was like being a missionary bishop,"</quote> said <who name="Bishop Robert Johnson">, the retired bishop of <location>Western North Carolina.</location></who></p><p>When he visits parishes, <quote sp="Bishop Robert Johnson">I don't talk about the problems we face in this diocese unless they ask me. I find that most people are focused forward,"</quote> he said.
</p><p>Some of those caught in the split faced painful choices.

<who name="Susan Pollard"/> believed that the <church><sect type="Episcopal"/> Church</church> had lost its biblical moorings. But her parish, <parish>St. Paul's in <location>Mount Lebanon</location></parish>, remained <sect type="Episcopal"/>, and her husband is a priest who assisted at <parish>St. Paul's</parish> and another <parish><sect type="Episcopal"/> parish, Christ Church in <location>Ross</location></parish>.
</p><p>She felt that <parish>St. Paul's</parish> had moved too far to the theological left. She could have been happy at <parish>Christ Church</parish>, but it was too far from their home in <loaction>Upper St. Clair.</loaction> She moved to <parish>Trinity in <location>Washington</location></parish>, and worships in the <diocese><sect type="Anglican"/> diocese</diocese> while her husband works in the Episcopal diocese.

<quote sp="Susan Pollard">"<parish>St. Paul's</parish> no longer represented what we believed in. Toward the end there were people who weren't talking to me, just because my views were known to be a little more traditional,"</quote> she said.
</p><p>Another member of <parish>St. Paul's</parish>, <who nmae="Doug Toth"/>, was a trustee of the original diocese who opposed secession. He said he resigned that post after learning he might be held personally liable in a lawsuit filed against the diocese by other opponents of secession. He felt threatened by his allies.
<quote sp="Doug Toth">
"I don't get involved any more. I go to church, I worship quietly, I keep my opinions to myself and I leave,"</quote> he said.

<who name="Jim Wilson"/>, a member of the <sect type="Anglican"/> diocesan council and member of the <church>Church of the Ascension in <location>Oakland</location></church>, reluctantly followed his bishop and parish out of the <church><sect type="Episcopal"/> Church</church>. He still has lunch with old friends who are leaders in the <diocese><sect type="Episcopal"/> diocese.</diocese><quote sp="Jim Willson">"It reminds me of the stories from World War I, where a truce was called for Christmas and soldiers from both sides met in the middle of no man's land to sing carols before they went back to shooting each other,"</quote> he said, in a reference to the lawsuit. <quote sp="Jim Willson">"There is tremendous personal sadness. I love those people."</quote></p><p>For diocesan leaders, litigation colors all conversations with friends on the other side, said the <who nmae="Rev. Karen Stevenson"/>, chairman of the standing committee of the <diocese><sect type="Anglican"/> diocese.</diocese><quote sp="Rev Karen Stevenson">"It's hard to pursue the reconciliation that we want to have as fellow Christians because we feel we have to check with the lawyers to make sure we're not setting some precedent,"</quote> she said.
</p><p>Due to the litigation, the financial services firm <who name="Morgan Stanley"/> froze diocesan trust funds pending a decision by an <location>Allegheny County</location> Common Pleas judge. The <stat>600-member Church</stat> of the Ascension was <stat>denied more than $30,000 in promised grants</stat>, most of which were intended to start a mission church.
</p><p>Its rector, the <who name="Rev. Jonathan Millard"/>, said his members are prepared to move if they lose their building to the <diocese><sect type="Episcopal"/> diocese</diocese>, though they worry about what will happen to the ashes of loved ones interred in the church.

<quote sp="Rev. Jonathan Millard">We've done what we believe is right and we aren't in control of the consequences,"</quote> he said.
</p><p>The lawsuit was filed in <date>2003</date> by <parish>Calvary parish in <location>Shadyside</location></parish>, as a pre-emptive strike against secession. <stat><location>Calvary,</location> with 1,200 members</stat>, has grown since the split. Its rector, the <who nmae="Rev. Harold Lewis"/>, admits that the split he fought to prevent has been good for <parish>Calvary</parish>.
</p><p>Members <quote sp="Rev. Harold Lewis">"are occupying positions in the life of the diocese which were impossible for us before because we were on the wrong side of the ideological divide,"</quote> he said.
</p><p>But <sect type="Episcopal"/> leaders are just as theologically conservative as the <sect type="Anglicans"/>. Among them is the <who nmae="Rev. Jeff Murph"/>, pastor of <parish>St. Thomas in <location>Oakmont</location></parish>. He lost about <stat>50 of his church's 630 members</stat>, who started an <sect type="Anglican"/> parish in a <church>Baptist church a few blocks away.
</church><quote sp="Rev. Jeff Murph">"There is sadness, because we love these people and have worked together with them for years,"</quote> he said. He offered to let them meet at <parish>St. Thomas</parish> or to send them out as an official <quote sp="Rev. Jeff Murph">"plant"</quote> of the parish. But those who left wanted a clear break with the<church><sect type="Episcopal"/> Church.
</church><parish>St. Thomas</parish> has come through strong, and some parish events have soared in attendance. After a mission trip to <location>New Orleans</location>, the parish changed its pre-Ash Wednesday pancake supper to a Mardi Gras event.

<quote sp="Rev. Jeff Murph">"We had jambalaya for 100 and ran out of food,"</quote> the Rev. Murph said.
</p><p>At the splinter congregation, <parish>St. John the Evangelist</parish>, the <who nmae="Rev. Lawrence Deihle"/> still speaks glowingly of <parish>St. Thomas</parish>, where he was once an assistant.

<quote sp="Rev. Lawrence Deihle">"It came down to a different calling from God,"</quote> he said of the split.
</p><p>People from both churches remain in prayer groups with friends from <parish>St. Thomas.</parish> The parishes aren't competitors, but share a mission field, he said.

<parish>Harvest <sect type="Anglican"/> Church in <location>Homer City, Indiana County</location>,</parish> moved miles away from two parishes that its <stat>30 members left.</stat><quote sp="Deacon Homer Hicks">"We felt that, to have a fresh start, we should be someplace that would give us an opportunity to reach into a community that didn't already have an Anglican church,"</quote> said <who nmae="Deacon Homer Hicks"/>, who leads the new congregation.

<quote sp="Deacon Homer Hicks">"We've all agreed that what has happened has happened,"</quote> he said. <quote sp="Deacon Homer Hicks">"We wish the other churches well. Christianity in this country is suffering and there is plenty of room for growth for everybody."</quote></p><p>Volunteers from <sect type="Episcopal"/> parishes still cook and serve meals at <parish>Shepherd's Heart in <location>Oakland</location></parish>, a parish for the homeless that belongs to the <sect type="Anglican"/> diocese.
</p><p>A more controversial ministry is that of Trinity School for Ministry, the <date>Ambridge seminary founded in 1976</date> as an evangelical alternative to more liberal <sect type="Episcopal"/> seminaries. Most <diocese><sect type="Episcopal"/> dioceses</diocese> will not send candidates there. But its graduates remain welcome here, said the <who nmae="Rev. James Simons"/>, president of the <sect type="Episcopal"/> standing committee, who has two degrees from Trinity.

<quote sp="Rev. James Simons">"We would have no difficulty sending people there,"</quote> he said.
</p><p>Nowhere is a spirit of reconciliation more evident than at <location>historic <church>Trinity Cathedral,</church> Downtown</location>. It serves both dioceses, and is governed by a<quote sp="Rev. James Sioms"> "chapter"</quote> of clergy and laity from both. On a chapter retreat, <who name="Archbishop Robert Duncan"/> and <who name="Bishop Robert Johnson"/> prayed together.

<quote sp="Bishop Robert Johnson">"I was very intentional about how I wanted to act with him, to approach the meeting with a spirit of Christian reconciliation,"</quote> Bishop Johnson said.
</p><p>The <who name="Rev. Lynn Edwards"/>, the only openly gay priest in the original diocese, is a member of the chapter.

<quote name="Rev. Lynn Edwards">"When we're in chapter meetings, I call him Archbishop, because that is his title now. I would never dream of calling him Mr. Duncan, as some people have. ... He is still a bishop, he simply isn't my bishop any more,"</quote> the Rev. Edwards said.

<who name="Fran Gargotta"/>, a member of the <diocese><sect type="Episcopal"/> diocesan council</diocese>, belongs to <parish>St. Brendan's in <location>Franklin Park</location></parish>, the only parish in the original diocese to take <who name="Bishop Robert Duncan"/> up on his offer to receive oversight from another bishop before the split. They loved the bishop who came from <location>West Virginia</location>, but were delighted when his services were no longer needed, she said.

<quote sp="Fran Gargotta">"<who name="Bishop Robert Johnson"/> is the right person for us. ... He understands what has transpired, and that there needs to be some healing."</quote></p><p>People who once felt constrained at diocesan meetings now speak their mind, she said.

<quote sp="Fran Gargotta">"It's like someone opened the windows and let in fresh air."</quote><who name="Lionel Deimel"/>, a board member of Progressive Episcopalians of Pittsburgh, calls the rebuilding of the <diocese><sect type="Episcopal"/> diocese</diocese><quote sp="Lionel Deimel">"a bittersweet victory."</quote> More liberal Episcopalians have a voice now, but he regrets the split, he said.
</p><p>The diocese has leaders who once opposed each other, and who still disagree on matters such as gay ordination. Trust has taken time, he said.

<quote sp="Lionel Deimel">"All of us are trying to figure out how to work together,"</quote> he said.<quote sp="Lionel Deimel"> "I suspect that, to some degree, all sides are going to try to avoid divisive issues until we have a longer history of working with one another."
</quote><parish>The Church of the Redeemer in <location>Squirrel Hill</location></parish> is a gay-friendly parish that had felt marginalized in the original diocese.

<quote sp="Rev. Cynthia Bronson Sweigert">"We are really happy in this new configuration,"</quote> said the Rev. Cynthia Bronson Sweigert.
</p><p>But she stays in touch with friends in the <diocese><sect type="Anglican"/> diocese,</diocese> and they compared notes on their diocesan conventions.</p><p><quote sp="Rev. Cynthia Bronson Sweigert">"We had all experienced a convention that was much more positive and happy than in the past,"</quote> she said. <quote sp="Rev. Cynthia Bronson Sweigert">"Schism is a negative thing. I really agree with that. But yet, it feels like an abstraction. The reality is that we were in an unhappy marriage for so long that we needed to divide before there could ever be any hope of reconciliation."</quote></p><p><who name="Bishop Robert Johnson"/> said he believes that God is at work in all of it.</p><p><quote sp="Bishop Robert Johnson">"We don't always know for certain just how. I don't, and Bishop Duncan doesn't,"</quote> he said.</p><p><quote sp="Bishop Robert Johnson">"But we have to believe that we're called to do the work that our Lord wants us to do, each in his own way, and not look back."</quote></p></body></article>
