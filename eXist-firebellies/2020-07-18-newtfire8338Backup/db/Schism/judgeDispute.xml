</p><p><who name="Judge Joseph James"/> of the Court of Common Pleas in <location>Allegheny County</location> ruled yesterday that the assets -- although not necessarily buildings and land titled in the name of the parishes that seceded -- belong to the <diocese><sect type="Episcopal"/> Diocese of Pittsburgh</diocese> of the <church><sect type="Episcopal"/> Church of the United States of America.</church></p><p>The <church>secessionist church</church>, the <diocese><sect type="Episcopal"/> Diocese of Pittsburgh</diocese> (<sect type="Anglican"/>), is in violation of its <date>October 2005</date> agreement with the <church><sect type="Episcopal"/> Church of America,</church> Judge James ruled.
</p><p>Many pages of the parties' briefs, he noted, were spent explaining the meaning of Paragraph One of the agreement, which describes what must be done with the diocese's centrally owned assets.

    <quote sp="Judge Joseph James">"However, I find that the language is clear and unambiguous and, therefore, requires no further explanation,"</quote> the order states. <quote sp="Judge Joseph James">"The property is to be held or administered by the Episcopal Diocese of the Episcopal Church of the United States of America. Regardless of what name defendants now call themselves, they are not the Episcopal Diocese of the Episcopal Church of the United States of America."</quote></p><p>Assets must be detailed within 30 days and transferred within 20 days after that, the order states.
</p><p>The <diocese><sect type="Episcopal"/> Diocese of Pittsburgh</diocese> (<sect type="Anglican"/>) withdrew in<date> October 2008</date> with <stat>58 parishes</stat>, or about <stat>60 percent of the parishes in the diocese</stat> before the split. Members of the seceding group voted to leave the <sect type="Episcopal"/> Church for what they considered failure to uphold biblical doctrine.
</p><p>The <sect type="Anglican"/> diocese now is affiliated with the <sect type="Anglican"/> Province of the <location>Southern Cone in South America</location> and the <church>new <sect type="Anglican"/> Church in North America.</church></p><p><who name="Archbishop Robert Duncan"/>, of the <diocese><sect type="Episcopal"/> Diocese of Pittsburgh (<sect type="Anglican"/>)</diocese>, said he had not seen the ruling and that members of the diocese would be disappointed if the court had awarded the assets to the<diocese><sect type="Episcopal"/> Diocese</diocese>. But regardless, members of the seceding diocese are confident about their new life together, he said.
</p><p><quote sp="Archbishop Robert Duncan">We have managed the last year without any income from our assets," he said. "We are doing well."</quote></p><p><who name="Rich Creehan"/>, communications director for the <diocese><sect type="Episcopal"/> Diocese</diocese>, said after the assets are transferred, the diocese will begin working on how to transfer buildings and land to the seceding parishes that want them.</p><p><quote sp="Rich Creehan">Anyone who wants to come back to the Episcopal Church is welcome, and we hope to find a way to proceed with those who don't [want to return] in a spirit of reconciliation,"</quote> he said.</p></body></article>
