        <verse n="1">
         <line n="1">Back in <refer img="school">school</refer> they never <refer img="school">taught</refer> us what we needed to know,</line>
        <line n="2">like how to deal with despair, or someone <refer type="idiom">breaking your heart</refer>.</line>
        <line n="3">For twelve <refer img="time">years</refer> I've <refer type="idiom">held it all together</refer> but a <refer img="time">night</refer> like this is begging to <refer type="idiom">pull me
            apart</refer>.</line>
        <line n="4">I played it quiet, left you deep in conversation.</line>
        <line n="5">I felt uncool and hung out around the <refer img="house">kitchen</refer>.</line>
        <line n="6">I remember I kept thinking that I know you never would,</line>
        <line n="7">and now I know I want to <refer img="death">kill</refer> you like only a best friend could.</line>

            <line n="10">As if this happening wasn't enough I got to go</line>
            <line n="11">and write a song just to remind myself how bad it sucked.</line>
            <line n="12">Ignore the sun, the cover's over my head.</line>
            <line n="13">I wrote a message on my <refer img="bed">pillow</refer> that says, "<refer type="bandMember">Jesse</refer>, stay <refer img="bed">asleep in bed</refer>."</line>
            <line n="14">So don't apologize. I hope you choke and die.</line>
            <line n="15">Search your cell for something with which to <refer img="death">hang yourself</refer>.</line>
