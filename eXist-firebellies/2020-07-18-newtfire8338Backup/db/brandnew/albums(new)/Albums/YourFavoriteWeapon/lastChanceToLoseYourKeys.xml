            <line n="1">I <refer type="idiom">cashed in all my chips</refer>
                <refer img="time">tonight</refer> and combed my hair till it was just right.</line>
            <line n="2">Cause I've been thinking about you and me girl, and we got something going
                on.</line>
            <line n="3">You told me you can't wait to see me and then you didn't bother to even show
                up.</line>
            <line n="4">This whole situation is incredibly typical</line>

        <line n="10">I won't be thinking about you baby.</line>
        <line n="11">You <refer img="phone">call me on the phone,</refer> and you don't even want to
            talk.</line>
        <line n="9">You're staring at me from across the room then turn your back when I walk
            up.</line>
        <line n="12">We got inches away, and I never even got close.</line>
        <line n="13">So leave your lipstick at home.</line>
        <line n="14">Don't pick up the <refer img="phone">phone</refer>.</line>
