        <verse n="1">
            <line n="1">It's hard to walk through all the places that your life used to be in</line>
            <line n="2">So you thought you'd shed a layer, maybe try on some new skin</line>
            <line n="3">Your friends are all imaginary, your shrink stopped answering her
                phone</line>
            <line n="4">So you decide to make <refer img="selfHarm">incisions</refer> at your <refer img="house">home </refer>while you're alone, all alone</line>

            <line n="5">But you're no tailor, you're no surgeon, <refer img="selfHarm">none of your
                    cuts go very straight</refer></line>
            <line n="6">Every new layer you uncover reveals something else you hate</line>
            <line n="7">And then you cracked your head, and broke some bones</line>
            <line n="8">And when you glued them back together you found out you did it wrong</line>
        </verse>

        <chorus n="1">
            <line n="9">Well this is the <refer type="songTitle">same logic</refer> that got us into

            <line n="10">(When we discovered we could use)</line>
            <line n="11">The <refer type="songTitle">same logic</refer> to get us out of
                trouble</line>
            <line n="12">And shake off all the people we abuse</line>

            <line n="13">I don't need to know where you come from</line>
            <line n="14">If you don't know where you belong</line>
            <line n="15">So how's it feel to walk around, like you're some sort of freak</line>
            <line n="16">You're just a monster in a costume</line>
            <line n="17">A shade of what you used to be</line>

        <verse n="2">
            <line n="18">And you've got your kind of <refer type="band">brand new</refer> face on,
                where all the skin's pulled thin and taut</line>
            <line n="19">And every kid you see starts crying so you stop going out for walks</line>
            <line n="20">Well I guess nothing can be perfect, so here's a comforting thought</line>
            <line n="21">At the bottom of the <refer img="water">ocean</refer>
                <refer img="animal">fish</refer> won't judge you by your faults</line>
