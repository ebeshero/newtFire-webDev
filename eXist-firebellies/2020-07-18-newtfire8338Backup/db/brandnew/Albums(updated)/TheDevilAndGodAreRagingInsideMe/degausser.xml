            <line n="1">Goodbye to <refer img="bed">sleep</refer></line>
            <line n="2">I think that staying up is exactly what I need</line>
            <line n="3">Well take apart your head</line>
            <line n="4">Take apart the counting</line>
            <line n="5">And the flock it has bred</line>
            <line n="6">Goodbye to love</line>
            <line n="7">It’s just a ride that will push you up</line>
            <line n="8">Right against the wall (Does everybody really need to know everyone?)</line>
            <line n="9">Take apart your head</line>
            <line n="10">Do you really think you’re really a part of it?</line>
            <line n="11">Right against the wall</line>
            <line n="12">And is your army really one of some thousands?</line>
            <line n="13">Chew it up and swallow it</line>
            <line n="14">And will you declare war on the loony bin?</line>

            <line n="22">Then you think you will inspire</line>
            <line n="23">Take apart your head (I wish I could inspire)</line>
