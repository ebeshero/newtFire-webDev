            <line n="1">The time has come for colds and overcoats. </line>
            <line n="2">We're quiet on the ride, </line>
            <line n="3">we're all just waiting to get home. </line>
            <line n="4">Another week away, my greatest fear. </line>
            <line n="5">I need the smell of summer, </line>
            <line n="6">I need its noises in my ears. </line>
            <line n="7">If looks could really kill, </line>
            <line n="8">then my profession would be staring. </line>
            <line n="9">Please know we do this cause we care </line>
            <line n="10">and not for the thrill. </line>
            <line n="11">Collect calls to home </line>
            <line n="12">to tell them that I realize </line>
            <line n="13">that everyone who lives will someday die </line>
            <line n="14">and die alone. </line>

            <line n="15">And we won't let you in. </line>

            <line n="19">I wrote more postcards than hooks. </line>
            <line n="20">I read more maps than books. </line>
            <line n="21">Feel like every chance to leave </line>
            <line n="22">is another chance I should have took. </line>
            <line n="23">Every minute is a mile. </line>
            <line n="24">I've never felt so hollow. </line>
            <line n="25">I'm an old abandoned church with broken pews </line>
            <line n="26">and empty aisles. </line>

            <line n="28">Watch me as I cut myself wide open </line>
            <line n="29">on this stage. Yes, I am paid </line>
            <line n="30">to spill my guts. I won't see home till spring. </line>
            <line n="31">Oh, I would kill for the Atlantic, </line>
            <line n="32">but I am paid to make girls panic </line>
            <line n="33">while I sing. </line>
