        <verse n="1">
            <line n="1">Keep the noise low.</line>
            <line n="2">She doesn't wanna blow it.</line>
            <line n="3">Shaking head to toe</line>
            <line n="4">while your left hand does "the show me around."</line>
            <line n="5">Quickens your heartbeat.</line>
            <line n="6">It beats me straight into the ground.</line>
        </verse>
        <verse n="2">
            <line n="7">You don't recover from a <refer img="time">night</refer> like this.</line>
            <line n="8">A victim, still lying in <refer img="bed">bed</refer>, completely motionless.</line>
            <line n="9">A hand moves in the dark to a zipper.</line>
            <line n="10">Hear a boy bracing tight against sheets</line>
            <line n="11">barely whisper, "This is so messed up."</line>
        </verse>
        <verse n="3">
            <line n="12">Upon arrival the guests had all stared.</line>
            <line n="13">Dripping <refer img="water">wet</refer> and clearly depressed,</line>
            <line n="14">he'd headed straight for the stairs.</line>
            <line n="15">No longer cool, but a boy in a stitch,</line>
            <line n="16">unprepared for a life full of lies and failing relationships.</line>
        </verse> <!--(Up the stairs: the station where --><line n="17">the act becomes the art of growing

            <line n="18">He keeps his hands low.</line>

            <line n="20">He's wet from head to toe and</line>
            <line n="21">his eyes give her the up and the down.</line>
            <line n="22">His stomach turns and he thinks of throwing up.</line>
            <line n="23">But the body on the bed beckons forward</line>
            <line n="24">and he starts growing up.</line>

        <chorus n="1">
            <line n="25">The fever, the focus.</line>

            <line n="38">He keeps his hands pinned down at his sides.</line>

            <line n="41">He is the lamb, she is the slaughter.</line>
            <line n="42">She's moving way too fast and all he wanted was to hold her.</line>
            <line n="43">Nothing that he tells her is really having an effect.</line>
