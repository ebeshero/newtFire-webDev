    <lyrics>
        <line n="1">It's hard to walk through all the places that your life used to be in</line>
        <line n="2">So you thought you'd shed a layer, maybe try on some new skin</line>
        <line n="3">Your friends are all imaginary, your shrink stopped answering her phone</line>
        <line n="4">So you decide to make incisions at your home while you're alone, all
            alone</line>

        <line n="5">But you're no tailor, you're no surgeon, none of your cuts go very
            straight</line>
        <line n="6">Every new layer you uncover reveals something else you hate</line>
        <line n="7">And then you cracked your head, and broke some bones</line>
        <line n="8">And when you glued them back together you found out you did it wrong</line>

        <line n="9">Well this is the same logic that got us into trouble the first time</line>
        <line n="10">(When we discovered we could use)</line>
        <line n="11">The same logic to get us out of trouble</line>
        <line n="12">And shake off all the people we abuse</line>

        <line n="13">I don't need to know where you come from</line>
        <line n="14">If you don't know where you belong</line>
        <line n="15">So how's it feel to walk around, like you're some sort of freak</line>
        <line n="16">You're just a monster in a costume</line>
        <line n="17">A shade of what you used to be</line>

        <line n="18">And you've got your kind of brand new face on, where all the skin's pulled thin
            and taut</line>
        <line n="19">And every kid you see starts crying so you stop going out for walks</line>
        <line n="20">Well I guess nothing can be perfect, so here's a comforting thought</line>
        <line n="21">At the bottom of the ocean fish won't judge you by your faults</line>
        <line n="22">(Judge you by your faults)</line>

        <line n="23">Well this is the same logic that got us into trouble the first time</line>
        <line n="24">(When we discovered we could use)</line>
        <line n="25">The same logic to get us out of trouble</line>
        <line n="26">And shake off all the people we abuse</line>

        <line n="27">Don't need to know where you come from</line>
        <line n="28">If you don't know where you belong</line>
        <line n="29">So how's it feel to walk around, like you're some sort of freak</line>
        <line n="30">You're just an actor, but now they caught you</line>
        <line n="31">A shade of what you used to be</line>

        <line n="32">Goddamnit you look so lovely, but you sound, you sound, you sound so
            ugly</line>
        <line n="33">Goddamnit you look so lovely, but you sound, you sound, you sound so
            ugly</line>
        <line n="34">Well Goddamnit, you look so lovely, but you sound, you sound, you sound so
            ugly</line>
        <line n="35">Well Goddamnit, you look so lovely, but you sound, you sound, you sound so
            ugly</line>

        <line n="36">Boy, we gave you every opportunity</line>
        <line n="37">Boy we gave our hands to get you off your knees</line>
        <line n="38">Boy sat at our table and ate everything</line>
        <line n="39">You say that you're still hungry</line>
        <line n="40">Then bite the plates and break your teeth</line>

        <line n="41">We started with psychodrama...</line>
