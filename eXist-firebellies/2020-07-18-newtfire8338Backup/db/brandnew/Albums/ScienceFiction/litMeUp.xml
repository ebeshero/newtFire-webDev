        <line n="1">This tape recounts a dream which occurred close to the termination of
            approximately 400 hours of intensive, individual therapy. Now, the patient recounts her
            dream:</line>
        <line n="2">I had this dream earlier this morning and I wrote it down. The dream is that I'm
            in some sort of a... and I'm in a hotel I'm at... I'm like at a convention or something.
            And I feel sort of almost like there's too much going on. There are all different kinds
            of meetings going on. Stuff on experimental psych and therapy, chemical aspects. All of
            it</line>
        <line n="3">But, I'm... while I don't mind having all this going on inside of me. It's sort
            of... I think I'm going to be relieved when it's over. When I can sort of settle back
            down</line>
        <line n="4">It's where you live, but you don't know how it's built</line>
        <line n="5">If we're just dust, then it doesn't matter who you kill</line>
        <line n="6">Don't cut me up and tell me that it's ok</line>
        <line n="7">Just turn it off 'cause I don't care anyway</line>
        <line n="8">It <refer type="songTitle">lit me up</refer></line>
        <line n="9">It <refer type="songTitle">lit me up</refer></line>

        <line n="11">It <refer type="songTitle">lit me up</refer></line>
        <line n="12">Something's stirring in a deep Atlantic trench</line>
        <line n="13">Doesn't forget the thousand years before it slept</line>
        <line n="14">It's the beast, it's my heart, it's open</line>
        <line n="15">Dive down into its unit in its head</line>

        <line n="20">It <refer type="songTitle">lit me up</refer> like a torch on a pitch black night</line>
        <line n="21">Like an ember in the needles of a dried out pine</line>
        <line n="22">Lit me up and I burn from the inside out</line>
        <line n="23">Yeah, I burn like a witch in a Puritan town</line>
        <line n="24">It lit me</line>
        <line n="25">It lit me</line>
        <line n="26">When I grow up I want to be a heretic</line>
        <line n="27">I want to climb over the wall 'cause I'm not on the list</line>
        <line n="28">I want to put my hands to work till the work's done</line>
        <line n="29">I want to open up my heart like the ocean</line>

        <line n="34">It <refer type="songTitle">lit me up</refer> like a rag soaked in gasoline</line>
        <line n="35">In the neck of the bottle breaking right at my feet</line>
        <line n="36">It <refer type="songTitle">lit me up</refer> and I burned from the inside out</line>
        <line n="37">Yeah, I burned like a witch in a Puritan town</line>
        <line n="38">It lit me</line>
        <line n="39">It was a good dream</line>
        <line n="40">If so...you will be dead tonight</line>
