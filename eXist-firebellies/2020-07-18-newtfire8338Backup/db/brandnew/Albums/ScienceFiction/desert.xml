    <lyrics>
        <line n="1">Last night I heard a voice that said, "This is the end"</line>
        <line n="2">All my nerves have been worn to the threads</line>
        <line n="3">I only honestly have one or two left</line>
        <line n="4">I got my faith, I got my family</line>
        <line n="5">I got a wire fence around my whole stake</line>
        <line n="6">If I believe only half what I read</line>
        <line n="7">I got a reason to be dug in deep</line>

        <line n="8">It's revelation saying</line>
        <line n="9">Don't come running to me</line>
        <line n="10">When they're coming for you</line>

        <line n="11">I seen those boys kissing boys</line>
        <line n="12">With their mouth in the street</line>
        <line n="13">But I raised my son to be a righteous man</line>
        <line n="14">I made it clear to him what fear of God means</line>

        <line n="15">I'd hold him down under Tompkins Lake</line>
        <line n="16">Before I ever let him go to the wolves</line>
        <line n="17">The path we walk is only narrow and straight</line>
        <line n="18">No son of mine will wander astray</line>
        <line n="19">Abomination</line>

        <line n="20">Don't come running to me when they're coming for you</line>
        <line n="21">(Don't come running to me when they're coming for you)</line>
        <line n="22">Don't come running to me when they're coming for you</line>
        <line n="23">(Don't come running to me when they're coming for you)</line>

        <line n="24">Last night I heard a voice that said, “Don't give up your gun”</line>
        <line n="25">They keep washing right up on those shores</line>
        <line n="26">Man they're gathering their numbers up</line>
        <line n="27">Those bleeding hearts come marching down my road</line>
        <line n="28">Well I'll be waiting right here at my door</line>
        <line n="29">It's a lie to say it wouldn't be fun</line>
        <line n="30">If you're joining them then I got one</line>
        <line n="31">With your name on it</line>

        <line n="32">Don't come running to me when they're coming for you</line>
        <line n="33">(Don't come running to me when they're coming for you)</line>
        <line n="34">Don't come running to me when they're coming for you</line>
        <line n="35">(Don't come running to me when they're coming for you)</line>

        <line n="36">Don't come running to me when they come gunning for you</line>
        <line n="37">(Don't come running to me when they come gunning for you)</line>

        <line n="38">Don't come running to me when they're coming for you</line>
        <line n="39">(Don't come running to me when they're coming for you)</line>

        <line n="40">God is love</line>
