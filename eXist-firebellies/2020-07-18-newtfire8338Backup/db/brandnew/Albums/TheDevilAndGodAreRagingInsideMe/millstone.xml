        <verse n="1">
            <line n="1">I used to be such a burning example</line>
            <line n="2">I used to be so original</line>
            <line n="3">I used to care, I was being cared for</line>
            <line n="4">Made sure I showed it to those that I love</line>
            <line n="5">I used to sleep without a single stir</line>
            <line n="6">Cause I was about my father's work</line>
        </verse>
        <chorus n="1">
            <line n="7">Well, take me out tonight (Whoa)</line>
            <line n="8">This ship of fools I'm on will sink</line>
            <line n="9">I'm my own stone around my neck</line>
            <line n="10">Be my breath, there's nothing I wouldn't give</line>
        </chorus>
        <verse n="2">
            <line n="11">I used to pray like God was listening</line>
            <line n="12">I used to make my parents proud</line>
            <line n="13">I was the glue that kept my friends together</line>
            <line n="14">Now they don't talk and we don't go out</line>
            <line n="15">I used to know the name of every person I'd kissed</line>
            <line n="16">Now I made this bed and I can't fall asleep in it</line>
        </verse>
        <chorus n="2">
            <line n="17">Well, take me out tonight (Whoa)</line>
            <line n="18">This ship of fools I'm on will sink</line>
            <line n="19">I'm my own stone around my neck</line>
            <line n="20">Be my breath, there's nothing I wouldn't give</line>
            <line n="21">Throw me that lifeline</line>
            <line n="22">This ship of fools I'm on will sink</line>
            <line n="23">I'm my own stone around my neck</line>
            <line n="24">Be my breath, there's nothing I wouldn't give</line>
        </chorus>
        <bridge n="1">
            <line n="25">Never hit the brakes</line>
            <line n="26">There's no time to save him</line>
            <line n="27">He just ran out in the street</line>
            <line n="28">Anybody know his name?</line>
            <line n="29">I think I recognize him</line>
            <line n="30">Sure as hell paid for that mistake</line>
            <line n="31">Whoa, whoa</line>
        </bridge>
        <chorus n="3">
            <line n="32">Well, take me out tonight (Whoa)</line>

            <line n="34">I'm my own stone around my neck (Whoa)</line>
            <line n="35">Be my breath, there's nothing I wouldn't give</line>
            <line n="36">To save my life tonight (Whoa)</line>
            <line n="37">This ship of fools I'm on will sink</line>
