        <verse n="1">
            <line n="1">I'd arrest you if I had handcuffs</line>
            <line n="2">I'd arrest you if I had the time</line>
            <line n="3">I'd throw you down in the backseat</line>
            <line n="4">As if you committed a terrible crime</line>
        </verse>
        <verse n="2">
            <line n="5">I'd break into towns worth of houses</line>
            <line n="6">And rob whole families blind</line>
            <line n="7">I'd do it to you like you'd do it to me</line>
            <line n="8">If I knew you would get away fine</line>
        </verse>
        <verse n="3">
            <line n="9">I'd drown all these crying babies</line>
            <line n="10">If I knew that their mothers wouldn't cry</line>
            <line n="11">I'd hold them down and I'd squeeze real soft</line>
            <line n="12">And let a piece of myself die</line>
        </verse>
        <chorus n="1">
            <line n="13">It's hard to be the better man</line>

            <line n="17">I'd arrest you if I had the time</line>
            <line n="18">I'd wait for you outside the courtroomâ€”and taunt you</line>
            <line n="19">As all of your appeals were declined</line>
        </verse>
        <verse n="5">
            <line n="20">I'd drive my car off of the bridge</line>
            <line n="21">If I knew that you weren't inside</line>
            <line n="22">Put the pedal to the floor, who could ask for more?</line>
            <line n="23">A fantastic way to kill some time</line>

            <line n="24">You could lay on your back and be beaten</line>
            <line n="25">You could put up your fists and fight</line>
            <line n="26">You could try any way out</line>
