            <line n="1">I used to be such a burning example</line>
            <line n="2">I used to be so original</line>
            <line n="3">I used to care, I was being cared for</line>
            <line n="4">Made sure I showed it to those that I love</line>
            <line n="5">I used to sleep without a single stir</line>
            <line n="6">Cause I was about my father's work</line>

            <line n="7">Well, take me out tonight (Whoa)</line>
            <line n="8">This ship of fools I'm on will sink</line>
            <line n="9">I'm my own stone around my neck</line>
            <line n="10">Be my breath, there's nothing I wouldn't give</line>

            <line n="11">I used to pray like God was listening</line>
            <line n="12">I used to make my parents proud</line>
            <line n="13">I was the glue that kept my friends together</line>
            <line n="14">Now they don't talk and we don't go out</line>
            <line n="15">I used to know the name of every person I'd kissed</line>
            <line n="16">Now I made this bed and I can't fall asleep in it</line>
