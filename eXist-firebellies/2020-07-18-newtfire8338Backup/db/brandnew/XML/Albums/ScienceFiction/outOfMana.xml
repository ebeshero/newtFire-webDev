        <!--bb: This one was actually hard to figure out, but I think I got it.  The chord progression sets up tension with a natural G chord - which isn't in the key - but then resolves to an E chord, which has a G# in it.  I think that's how it works.  That's my story anyway lol.-->
        <!--bb: This song also features a keychange to C sharp at the end.-->
