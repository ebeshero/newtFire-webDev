        <verse n="1">
            <line n="1">Ever since I was young your word is the word that always won</line>
            <line n="2">Worry and wake the ones you love</line>
            <line n="3">A phone call I'd rather not receive</line>
            <line n="4">Please use my body while I sleep</line>
            <line n="5">My lungs are fresh and yours to keep</line>
            <line n="6">Kept clean and they will let you breathe</line>
        </verse>

        
            <line n="7">Is this the way a toy feels when its batteries run dry?</line>
            <line n="8">I am the watch you always wear, but you forget to wind</line>
        

        <chorus n="1">
            <line n="9">Nobody plans to be half a world away at times like these</line>
            <line n="10">So I sat alone and waited out the night</line>
            <line n="11">The best part of what has happened was the part I must have missed</line>
            <line n="12">So I'm asking you to shine it on and stick around</line>
            <line n="13">I'm not writing my goodbyes</line>
        </chorus>

        <verse n="2">
            <line n="14">I submit no excuse</line>
            <line n="15">If this is what I have to do</line>
            <line n="16">I owe you every day I wake</line>
            <line n="17">If I could I would shrink myself</line>
            <line n="18">And sink through your skin to your blood cells</line>
            <line n="19">And remove whatever makes you hurt but</line>
            <line n="20">I am too weak to be your cure</line>

            <line n="29">You will beat this, starting now</line>
            <line n="30">And you will always be around</line>
