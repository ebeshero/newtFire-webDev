        <verse n="1">
            <line n="1">If it makes you less sad, I will <refer img="death">die</refer> by your hand</line>
            <line n="2">Hope you find out what you are; already know what I am</line>
            <line n="3">And if it makes you less sad, we'll start talking again</line>
            <line n="4">You can tell me how vile I already know that I am</line>
            <line n="5">I'll grow old, start acting my age</line>
            <line n="6">It'll be a <refer type="band">brand new</refer> day in a life that you hate</line>
            <line n="7">A crown of gold, a heart that's harder than stone</line>
            <line n="8">And it hurts a whole lot, but it's missed when it's gone</line>
        </verse>
        <chorus n="1">
            <line n="9">Call me a safe bet, I'm betting I'm not</line>
            <line n="10">I'm glad that you can forgive, only hoping as time goes, you can forget</line>
        </chorus>
        <verse n="2">
            <line n="11">If it makes you less sad, I'll move out of this state</line>
            <line n="12">You can keep to yourself, I'll keep out of your way</line>
            <line n="13">And if it makes you less sad, I'll take your pictures all down</line>
            <line n="14">Every picture you paint, I will paint myself out</line>
            <line n="15">It's cold as a tomb, and it's dark in your room</line>
            <line n="16">When I sneak to your bed to pour salt in your wounds</line>
            <line n="17">So call it quits, or get a grip</line>
            <line n="18">You say you wanted a solution; you just wanted to be missed</line>
        </verse>
        <chorus n="2">
            <line n="19">Call me a safe bet, I'm betting I'm not</line>
            <line n="20">I'm glad that you can forgive, only hoping as time goes, you can forget</line>
            <line n="21">So you can forget, you can forget</line>
        </chorus>
        <verse n="3">
            <line n="22">You are calm and reposed</line>
            <line n="23">Let your beauty unfold</line>
            <line n="24">Pale white, like the skin stretched over your bones</line>
            <line n="25">Spring keeps you ever close</line>
            <line n="26">You are second-hand smoke</line>
            <line n="27">You are so fragile and thin, standing trial for your sins</line>
            <line n="28">Holding on to yourself the best you can</line>
            <line n="29">You are the smell before rain</line>
            <line n="30">You are the blood in my veins</line>
        </verse>
        <chorus n="3">
            <line n="31">Call me a safe bet, I'm betting I'm not</line>
            <line n="32">I'm glad that you can forgive, only hoping as time goes, you can forget</line>
