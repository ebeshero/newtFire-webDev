                <desc>A Thomas Sant &amp; Sons Co., with a very inconsistent middle initial, is
                    listed as the shipper in a significant portion of the outbound shipments from
                    Oreminea, yet no other clay pit, siding, or mining company appears to have been
                    based in Oreminea besides the Woodbury Clay Co. So who is this mysterious
                    figure? The Thomas &lt;b&gt;H.&lt;/b&gt; Sant &amp; Sons Co. was a clay
                    brokerage firm based in East Liverpool, Ohio, operating from YEAR YEAR YEAR
                    YEAR. While the Woodbury Clay Co. itself shipped largely to manufacturers of
                    refractory brick, and steel mills where refractory products would be molded
                    on-site, the activities of the Thomas H. Sant Co. introduced additional variety
                    to our list of shippers. They marketed various grades of clay from mines across
                    Pennsylvania, Ohio and elsewhere to manufacturers of pottery, insulators and
                    other ceramic products, usually on a per-carload basis. Finish description

                    either 1898 or 1945. However, an abandoned structure is clearly visible on
                    satellite imagery along the tracks at almost exactly the milepost that such a
                    number would have been assigned to. A visit to the site and to a local
                    historical society will be necessary to confirm the identity of this structure.

                <desc>Peter S. Duncan of Hollidaysburg, PA, was an industrialist who operated
                    several iron and clay mines in Blair Co. for many years, including a clay pit in
                    nearby Ore Hill, PA. Although substantially smaller than that at Oreminea, this
                    mine was served by the PRR's Bloomfield Branch. A sample of sand excavated from
                    this mine was among the mineral displays exhibited by the State of Pennsylvania
                    at the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893. Peter S. Duncan passed away in May
                    of 1937—hence why "Peter S. Duncan Estate" is listed as the shipper on the
                    one bill in this collection on which his name appears, from October of the same
                    year. It is unclear why a shipment of clay left Oreminea under this name. One
                    potential explanation might be that the mines at Ore Hill, which would have been
                    largely mined out after several decades of operation, shut down after his death,
                    with the estate filling remaining orders by contracting shipments from other
                    clay pits.</desc>
