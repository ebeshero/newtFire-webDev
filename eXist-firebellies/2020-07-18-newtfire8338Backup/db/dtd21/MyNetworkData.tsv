        The arm of a small Amygdala Great One. 
        Strictly speaking, the Amygdalan Arm is no trick weapon of any sort, but certain madmen wield them like clubs. 
        Starts as a large, tough blunt weapon formed of bone, but when extended, the hand quivers as if it were still alive.
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare, cave at the end of the blood river to the right after getting out of the building that used to be the shortcut to the Cleric Beast in the main game. Gatling Gun Hunter dropping the Gatling Gun and a Blood-Starved Beast can be also found here. Arm is near the Blood-Starved Beast at the end of the cave.
        
        
        
        The Amygdalan Arm is a Trick Weapon in name only, considering that it is an arm obtained from Amygdala.
        The arm is remarkably small, as even the Lesser Amygdalae are huge. Perhaps it came from a newborn Amygdala.
        The arm could be the inspiration behind the Burial Blade.

        Beast Claw
        
        
        Beastly weapon wielded by Irreverent Izzy.
        Crafted by chiseling the long bones of an undead darkbeast and fastening them to the weapon. The bones are still alive, and when unleashed, grant its wielder a spurt of beastly power. 
        As flesh is flayed and blood is sprayed, the beast within awakens, and in time, the wielder of this weapon surges with both strength and feverish reverie."
        
        
        
        Ailing Loran Chalice: Layer 2 treasure room. Room is on the right when exiting the elevator from first layer boss fight, before the second layers lantern.
        Can be bought from messengers for 34000 echoes after acquisition.
        Can be bought from messengers after co-operation with player who has them. This only occurs in Hunter's dream before fight with Gehrman or Moon Presence. It is not needed to complete any Chalice Dungeons. It is unknown if this is glitch or intentional. Was patched by 1.07 or 1.08.
        
        
        
        When this weapon is equipped, your gloves will be replaced by two bone gauntlets. This can allow for the lost art of rapid glove changing if you switch your weapons really fast.
        You can charge the beasthood meter on the first windows (Gilbert) of Central Yharnam
        In the past, there was a rare glitch that allowed a player to obtain this weapon without finding it in the Chalice Dungeons.
        It has since been patched, although it isn't quite known when it was successfully patched.

        Beasthunter Saif
        
        
        A trick weapon used by the old hunters. 
        A second blade is found inside the curve of the main one. In its initial form, the saif can be wielded like a long curved sword, but when transformed, its blade is contracted, allowing for quick, repeated stabs. 
        Although this trick weapon allows for adaptive combat, it was later replaced by saws and similar weapons that were more effective at disposing of beasts."

        Beast Cutter
        
        
        A trick weapon used by Old Hunters. 
        This thick iron cleaver slices through the toughest of beast hides, and when transformed the blade splits into sections, allowing one to lash it in the fashion of a heavy whip. 
        This crude weapon relies on brute force and is regrettably inelegant, suggesting that the hunts of the earliest hunters made for horrific affairs, painted in sanguine black and reds."
        
        
        
        When walking up the stairs to the nightmare version of the Grand Cathedral, turn left onto a small platform, then roll off and walk down some rough terrain to find the weapon on a corpse.
        
        
        
        Reminds many of the Zanpakut≈ç , a fictional segmented sword that can function as a whip. It is an iconic weapon from the Bleach anime.
        The untransformed form of the weapon is a cleaver-like serrated club, and it really looks like the samoan war club "Nifo Oti".

        Blade of mercy
        
        
        A special trick weapon passed down among hunters of hunters. One of the oldest weapons of the workshop. 
        Splits into two when activated. The weapon's warped blades are forged with siderite, a rare mineral of the heavens. Most effective swift attacks,such as after a quick-stepping."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers for 40000 echoes after obtaining the Crow Hunter Badge from Eileen the Crow's quest line.
        Killing Eileen is also a way to get the weapon early in the game.
        While progressing through Eileen's quest, it's possible for her to be killed by Henryk and thus drop the Crow Hunter Badge as a result, although the quest line will end.
        
        
        
        The Blade of Mercy was originally named as "Warped Twinblades" during the Alpha test, and it was the tool of choice for the "agile" hunter.
        Both the Burial Blade and Blade of Mercy make mentions of a mineral known as siderite in their descriptions.
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite, and it seems to be the reason why arcane power has direct scaling with both blade's damage output. Due to its extraterrestrial origins, that may explain why it cannot be buffed by an external source of any sort.
        It loosely resembles the Eleum Loyce from Dark Souls 2, a sword with two blades at the front.

        The demented hunter weapon brandished by Brador, the Healing Church assassin. 
        The Bloodletter assumes its true and terrifying form after it draws upon blood from the inner reaches of one's body and soul. 
        This is the only effective means of expelling tainted blood, or so Brador, isolated in his cell, continued to believe."
        
        
        
        Obtain the underground cell inner chamber key.
        Return to the underground prison (from the underground corpse pile lamp, go up the stairs and turn left) and open the door to Brador's cell. His cell is the second on the left behind a flight of downward stairs. Kill Brador to obtain the bloodletter.
        Brador will not be hostile in his cell, but will invade the player right outside his cell.

        Boom Hammer
        
        
        A trick weapon used by the old hunters, and crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. 
        A giant hammer equipped with a miniature furnace. When ignited and fired, it emits a volley of flame that explodes furiously upon impact. 
        Crush the beasts, then burn them - the brute simplicity of the Boom Hammer was favored by hunters with an acute distaste for beasts."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare. Inside a house that looks out of Central Yharnam, the same that is the shortcut to the cleric beast in the main game, where the 10 quicksilver bullets used to be. Be sure to shoot the explosives around the item (or act fast), as the wheelchair huntsman's corpse conceals a delayed molotov set to trigger when you try to grab the Boom Hammer, potential killing you in a huge blast.
        
        
        
        When the Boomhammer is lit, Beast Patient mobs will back away from the player as if they had a torch equipped. (May need to initiate primed attack first)

        Burial Blade
        
        
        Trick weapon wielded by Gehrman, the first hunter." 
        A masterpiece that defined the entire array of weapons crafted at the workshop. Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens. 
        Gehrman surely saw the hunt as a dirge of farewell, wishing only that his prey might rest in peace, never again to awaken to another harrowing nightmare. "
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 60,000 Blood Echoes after defeating Gehrman, the First Hunter and acquiring the Old Hunter Badge from him.
        To make Gehrman fight you, the "Refuse" option must be selected.
        If one accepts his proposal, the game will outright end there and it will be impossible to obtain this weapon in that playthrough (not including the uncanny/lost forms found in the chalice dungeons).
        Normally, the Burial Blade can only be obtained in NG+ and beyond. However, one can bypass this by using Bold Hunter's Mark, or being killed, during The Moon Presence boss battle.
        
        
        
         The Burial Blade was the first trick weapon ever created, and it inspired others to develop new trick weapons, usually on the premise of adapting to different combat scenerios.
        Not all weapons adapt to different combat scenerios (e.g. Tonitrus), but the Burial Blade still inspired an entire series of weapons that could "transform" to satisfy different purposes.
        It was created, and exclusively wielded, by Gehrman.
        A Burial Blade can be found above the workshop table in the Hunter's Dream.
        The weapon's description mentions that "Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens."
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite. Due to its extraterrestrial nature, it could be the reason why it has direct scaling with arcane and cannot be tampered by external sources.
        Both the Burial Blade and the Blade of Mercy mentions the use of it in their descriptions.
        Interestingly enough, these two weapons also resemble the talons of Mergo's Wet Nurse.
        The shape of the scythe highly resembles Rurufon's scythe from Shadow Tower Abyss, an early title created by From Software as well as being recurring weapons in Souls series.
        A strange bug on rare occurrences the cape on the hunter may come off, usually in a boss fight you could notice if you dodge back and do an R1 combo the cape disappears. [Note, I haven't seen this happen in a while, it's possible that it may have been fixed, but I'll need confirmation on this]

        Chikage
        
        
        Foreign-made weapon wielded by the royal guards who protect Annalise, Queen of the Vilebloods at Cainhurst Castle. 
        When the intricate, rippled engraving that spans the Chikage's blade is imbrued with blood, the sword sings in scarlet hues. 
        However, the rite eats away at the wielder's very essence."
        
        
        
        Join the Cainhurst Vilebloods covenant available at Cainhurst Castle, and then purchase from the Messengers for 50,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Chikage isn't actually a katana - it is a katana/european sword hybrid. Its short crossguard resembles the one of an early viking sword, or the one of a xiphos (greek sword). The closest european crossguard shape with  this sword is the one of a Karabela (a polish sabre). In other hand, the  hilt and pommel resemble the ones of a longsword (a bit longer, to get easier katana traditional jutsu swings), while the blade shape and the 2-handed fighting style is very similar to a katana. A possible explanation for the origin of this hybrid is that the katana's design was imported to Cainhurst, where some modifications were made to create a sword similar to that commonly used by their knights.
        The Chikage is an allusion to a particular 'breed' of Katanas in the Souls games. While it is similar to both the Hiltless and Chaos Blade from Demon's Souls and Dark Souls respectively, the Chikage bears a stronger resemblance to the Magic Sword "Makoto" (also from Demon's Souls). The Makoto is the only one the bunch to actually DRAIN the user's HP over time, rather than decrease it with each successful swing.
        Chikage (ÂçÉÊôØ) literally means "Thousands Views", however if you separated the word into Chi Kage (Ë°ÄÂΩ±), it means "Blood Shadow". This could be correlated to the fact that Shadows Of Yharnam wield a similar katana with a slight  crossguard, however without using the bloodtinge.
        The transforming attack has the hunter sheathe the Chikage before unleashing a strike. This is a reference to Iaijutsu, a traditional Japanese sword technique that focuses on quick-drawing. At its finest, Iaijutse allows the warrior to unsheathe and strike at incredible speeds.
        The name seems to be a tribute to Chikage Yamamura (mentioned as a "special thanks" in credits)
        The name may also be a reference to the work "1000 Plateaus" by Giles Deluze and Felix Guattari, a famous philosophical essay about fluidity and functionality, maybe dirrectly tied to the esoteric nature of the weapons function.

        One of the old trick weapons of the Healing Church, a hunting weapon formed from one of the giant picks that appear in old beast tales. 
        The Church Pick initially serves as a large sword, but when transformed functions as an extended war pick. In spite of its origins, it is a highly practical weapon."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Dropped by a hunter wearing Yahar'Gul set (presumably, this is the summonable Old Hunter Defector Antal) in one of the cells that you open with the Underground Cell Key from the Research Hall. To make this battle simple, attack him through the door with a strong R2 attack, then leave the room. He will lose sight of you and his AI will return to a standstill behind the door. Rinse and repeat until dead.
        
        
        
        The Church Pick And The Hunter's Axe both have similar appearance. When transformed, both are wielded as a polearm and have the same de-transformation attack. The only difference apart from the Church Pick having a slightly more complicated mechanism is that the Hunter's Axe is a strength-based weapon.
        A few of its attacks in the transformed mode are very similar to that of the Burial Blade.
        The Church Pick os the weapon of choice of the summonable Old Hunter NPC Defector Antal
        
        
    

        Amygdalan Arm 
        
        
        The arm of a small Amygdala Great One. 
        Strictly speaking, the Amygdalan Arm is no trick weapon of any sort, but certain madmen wield them like clubs. 
        Starts as a large, tough blunt weapon formed of bone, but when extended, the hand quivers as if it were still alive.
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare, cave at the end of the blood river to the right after getting out of the building that used to be the shortcut to the Cleric Beast in the main game. Gatling Gun Hunter dropping the Gatling Gun and a Blood-Starved Beast can be also found here. Arm is near the Blood-Starved Beast at the end of the cave.
        
        
        
        The Amygdalan Arm is a Trick Weapon in name only, considering that it is an arm obtained from Amygdala.
        The arm is remarkably small, as even the Lesser Amygdalae are huge. Perhaps it came from a newborn Amygdala.
        The arm could be the inspiration behind the Burial Blade.

        Holy Moonlight Sword
        
        
        An arcane sword discovered long ago by Ludwig. 
        When blue moonlight dances around the sword, and it channels the abyssal cosmos, its great blade will hurl a shadowy lightwave. 
        The Holy Moonlight Sword is synonymous with Ludwig, the Holy Blade, but few have ever set eyes on the great blade, and whatever guidance it has to offer, it seems to be of a very private, elusive sort."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Found on the Underground Corpse Pile after the fight against Ludwig, The Holy Blade. Ludwig's head will be lying there and you can:
        Kill the head for the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and talk to the head. When prompted, reply "Yes" and you'll get the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and reply "No", then come back later and Simon the Harrowed will be there and give you the sword.
        NOTE: This weapon is missable. If Lawrence is killed before you obtain it, you will no longer be able to talk to the head or obtain it from Simon.
        
        
        
        It seems to be another reappearance of the Moonlight Greatsword, a recurring item found around FromSoftware's games. Notable examples of such games include the first, second and third Dark Souls games, Demon's Souls, King's Field, Ninja Blade, Enchanted Arms, Armored Core, 3D Dot Game Heroes, and Otogi.

        Hunter Axe
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used on the hunt. Retains the qualities of an axe, but offers a wider palette of attacks by transforming. Boasts a heavy blunt attack, leading to high rally potential. No matter their pasts, beasts are no more than beasts. Some choose this axe to play the part of executioner."
        
        
        
        It's possible to pick this trick weapon as a starting weapon near the beginning of Bloodborne.
        If not chosen, it can instead be purchased from the Messengers after the Hunter has found the Saw Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is wielded by Father Gascoigne.
        However, he has a moveset that is different from the Hunter's version.
        He is also capable of using his unique Hunter Pistol even while his Hunter Axe is transformed, which is impossible for the Hunter to do.
        It's also wielded by the Madara's Twin who drops Madara's Whistle when defeated.
        Another hostile hunter NPC wields this trick weapon in the Nightmare Frontier.
        It's been heavily debated by the fanbase whether the transformed mode is a halberd or poleaxe.
        Both forms utilized axe heads with a spear tip at the end (although some poleaxes used hammer heads instead).
        However, neither weapon was known to have extendable handles, which is a special trademark of the Hunter Axe.
        In either case, it's possible this trick weapon was inspired by both weapons and simply incorporated many different designs.
        While wielded in it's transformed mode if the player had a torch equipped in the off-hand beasts afraid of the fire will still recoil in fear of you as if you were brandishing the torch normally (Tested on Beast Patient)

        Kirkhammer
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. On the one side, an easily handled silver sword. On the other, a giant obtuse stone weapon, characterized by a blunt strike and extreme force of impact. The Church takes a heavy-handed, merciless stance toward the plague of beasts, an irony not lost upon the wielders of this most symbolic weapon."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers after acquiring the Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        A miniature of the Kirkhammer was included as the Pre-Order Bonus for Asian editions of Bloodborne. [See the Bundles page for details]
        A "kirk" is an archaic old english word meaning "church."
        This means the weapon is literately known as the Church Hammer.
        The wording also might be a nod to Nordic culture since the word "Kirk" originated from northern England and Old Norse wording.
        The etched wording on the side of the hammer part has similarities to the Old Norse alphabet.
        However, it also has similarities to the Elder Futhark, one of the oldest forms of the runic alphabet system used by Germanic tribes.
        Similar etchings can be found on gravestones all over Yharnam.
        The sword used for this weapon is very similar to the one used for Ludwig's Holy Blade.
        This suggests that the Healing Church used the method of "interchangeable parts" to efficiently mass produce weapons for their hunters.
        However, the sword used for the Kirkhammer is shorter.
        It's wielded by Alfred, should you choose to be friends with him.
        He uses this weapon as a summon.
        However, he wields the Logarius' Wheel if you find him in Cainhurst Castle under special circumstances.
        When untransformed, with the hammer part on the character's back, some cloth parts (capes etc.) of the armor can either get awkwardly stuck on it or cover it.
        Despite being labeled a 'stone weapon', the etchings, wear, and sound produced when it strikes indicate that the hammer is in fact made of metal.

        Kos Parasite
        
        
        When the carcass of Kos washed up on the coast, its insides were teeming with tiny parasites, unlike any found in humans. 
        This atypical weapon can only be clasped tight and swung, but a Kos Parasite is said to stimulate phantasms inhabiting a lumenwood"
        
        
        
        Dropped by Orphan of Kos
        
        
        
        The Kos Parasite is perhaps the most interestingly unique weapon in Bloodborne in various ways: It is one of two weapons that can reach it's full potential while using a rune (the other being Beast Claw), the weapon itself is not held, it is purely an arcane weapon, it is the only weapon directly dropped by defeating a boss, it has the highest durability of any weapon at 600 respectively, it is the only weapon to have an A-scaling of any weapon without any upgrades and is the only weapon to have an S-scaling by upgrading it twice.

        Logarius's Wheel
        
        
        "Weapon wielded by martyr Logarius' band of executioners. 
        Used to slaughter the Vilebloods in Cainhurst. Bathed in pools of their blood, and forever steeped in their ire. 
        Transform to release the power of the wheel and manifest their lingering rage in a show of utter brilliance."
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 13,000 Blood Echoes after acquiring the Wheel Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        Alfred utilizes the Logarius' Wheel when found in Cainhurst Castle.
        This weapon is yet another reference to Berserk, as they are often made in Miyazaki's previous Souls games.
        "Logarius and his band of executioners" bear many similarities to Mozgus, an insanely devout man who traveled the land torturing heretics along with his disciples.
        The wheel in particular was wielded by one of his six disciples, .
        In Dark Souls, Bonewheel Skeletons are another reference to Mozgus' disciples.
        In real life, although wheels weren't typically wielded as weapons, they were commonly used as torture devices, especially during the Middle Ages.
        Torture wheels were nicknamed "breaking wheels," since victims often times would have their limbs broken during the process.
        They were also known as "catherine wheels."
         It's quite possible that Logarius' Wheel also takes some inspiration in its use as a weapon from the English folklore legend of Tom Hickathrift. Tom was a fabled giant killer who made use of a cartwheel to vanquish the Wisbech Giant (also referred to as an ogre).
        Lore theories can be found under "From Berserk to Bloodborne".

        Ludwig's Holy Blade
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. It is said that the silver sword was employed by Ludwig, the first hunter of the church. When transformed, it combines with its sheath to form a greatsword. 
        It exhibits several departures from the workshop's design, suggesting that the Church anticipated much larger inhuman beasts."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased for 20,000 echoes from the Messengers after obtaining the Radiant Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon was wielded by Ludwig, a famous hunter of the Healing Church who designed the blade based on the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        According to the description, Ludwig wielded this sword in combat instead of the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        However, in his boss fight, he wields the Holy Moonlight Sword during a certain part in the fight.
        It is possible that Ludwig wielded the Holy Moonlight Sword and his fellow hunters, inspired by the huge weapon, sought to make replicas. Unable to make a magic sword, a huge metal sheath was the compromise.
        Before the DLC's release, Ludwig's Holy Blade was thought of as From Software's traditional "Moonlight Greatsword" seen throughout various games by the fanbase.
        However, this sword was eventually revealed in the DLC to be a replica of the "true" Moonlight Greatsword in Bloodborne, the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        This isn't the first time Miyazaki used the name of classical music composers in a game.
        A boss from the first "Dark Souls" game, Dragonslayer Ornstein, is named after Leo Ornstein.
        Berlioz from "Armored Core 4" is named after Hector Berlioz.
        The normal form of this weapon is very similar to the sword used for the Kirkhammer.
        However, this sword's normal form has a slightly longer reach when compared to the Kirkhammer's blade.
        The similar nature of these swords suggests that the Healing Church used the method of interchangeable parts to quickly mass produce weapons for their hunters.

        Rakuyo
        
        
        Hunter weapon wielded by Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower. 
        A trick sword originated in the same country as the Cainhurst Chikage, only this sword feeds not off blood, but instead demands great dexterity. 
        Lady Maria was fond of this aspect of the Rakuyo, as she frowned upon blood blades, despite being a distant relative of the queen. 
        One day, she abandoned her beloved Rakuyo, casting it into a dark well, when she could stomach it no longer."
        
        
        
        Fishing Hamlet. Get to the bottom of the well. Can be reached from the underground tunnels at the end of the area or via a ladder in the well right away. In that area a Shark Giant will wander around. Fighting him makes a second one appear after the first reaches sufficiently low health. The first giant will walk over near the ladder and scream at the ceiling, causing the second one to drop. The second one drops the weapon.
        Fighting the two of them can be difficult and it is a good idea to use the Shaman Bone Blade to make them fight each other and finish off the weaker one. Molotov cocktails are also very effective against them. If neither is available to you, try to kill the one with the anchor first, as it is significantly harder to dodge.
        One easy way to beat them is use of ranged weapon like Simon's Bowblade if you are a bloodtinge build, and the Holy Moonlight Sword if you are an arcane build.
        A Threaded Cane's transformed whip can easily hit the giants from the ledge once they're lured over and begin attacking, but be sure to keep your distance after each hit. Except that there is no way to lure them over the the ledge. No ranged weapon will hit the one standing at the back and the one hanging from the ceiling doesn't drop down until the first one is at 50% health. 
        Unlike other giants in the game, these ones are easy to gun parry for a visceral attack. Keep in mind this will get very tricky after the other one starts fighting, so try to separate them and time your viscerals to get the invincibility at the right moment.
        If your range is inadequate you can use the monocular to angle a throwing knife to be able to hit the shark giant in the back. This way, you can continue from the strategy of killing them on the ledge with a gun/magic without going around. (confirmed as of January 19th, 2019)
        Chaining together backstabs is a very effecient way of dealing with them, if played right you should be able to eliminate the first shark giant before the second reaches you this way. It is extremely difficult to get behind the patrolling Shark Giant without him detecting you. 
        For a video showing an easy way to kill the sharks with a monocular and a throwing knife strategy, check .
        
        
        
        Rakuyo (ËêΩËëâ) literally means "falling leaf".
        The sword of Rakuyo bears resemblance to the "ky≈´ gunt≈ç", which was a hybrid of the sabre/katana with a handguard, used during the Russo-Japanese War.

        Reiterpallasch
        
        
        Weapon wielded by the Knights of Cainhurst. 
        Combines an elegant knight's sword with the peculiar firearm wielded by the Cainhurst order. 
        The old nobles, long-time imbibers of blood, are no strangers to the sanguine plague, and the disposal of beasts was a discrete task left to their servants, or knights, as they were called for the sake of appearances."
        
        
        
        It's found in a chest located in the entrance hall of Cainhurst Castle, where the Bound Widows are first encountered. When you first enter the room from the main entrance, run towards your two o'clock. The chest will be found in a corner.
        
        
        
        The Reiterpallasch (from German Reiter "horseback rider" and hungarian pallos [Ààp…ílo É] "sword") is a 17th century Hungarian straight sword with a typically double edged blade and guarded hilt that was used by Hungarian noble cavalry and later adapted by most western European armies.
        As pointed out in its description, the rifle spear is made "possibly in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon" (i.e. this one).
        Wynne D. Fanchon from Armored Core: For Answer; another From Software title, pilots a NEXT named Reiterpallasch.

        Strictly speaking, the Amygdalan Arm is no trick weapon of any sort, but certain madmen wield them like clubs. 
        Starts as a large, tough blunt weapon formed of bone, but when extended, the hand quivers as if it were still alive.
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare, cave at the end of the blood river to the right after getting out of the building that used to be the shortcut to the Cleric Beast in the main game. Gatling Gun Hunter dropping the Gatling Gun and a Blood-Starved Beast can be also found here. Arm is near the Blood-Starved Beast at the end of the cave.
        
        
        
        The Amygdalan Arm is a Trick Weapon in name only, considering that it is an arm obtained from Amygdala.
        The arm is remarkably small, as even the Lesser Amygdalae are huge. Perhaps it came from a newborn Amygdala.
        The arm could be the inspiration behind the Burial Blade.

        Rifle Spear
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. A prototype weapon serving as a simple firearm and spear, possibly created in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon. Lacks any notable functions, saving that it is the only trick weapon with an attached gun. "
        
        
        
        It can be found inside a hidden building in Old Yharnam. From the area you fight the first NPC Hunter (who wields a saw spear), drop down where the railing is missing in a corner and land on the ledges below. Go into the building and follow the stairs up; eventually you can find it stashed on a corpse tucked away in a hidden nook as you advance.
        Bought from the messengers for 4000 blood echoes after acquiring the Powder Keg Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        According to the Rifle Spear's description, it was designed as an imitation of "a lost Cainhurst weapon".
        That particular weapon may or may not be the Reiterpallasch.
        It should be noted these two weapons are the only two skill/firearm hybrids whose alternate forms utilize guns.
        The third skill/firearm hybrid weapon in this game is Simon's Bowblade, which transforms from a sword into a bow.
        The Rifle Spear is carried by a Yahar'Gul Hunter in the Cathedral Ward.
        This fight can be tricky because you first encounter a Yahar'Gul Hunter that uses a Tonitrus near the base of the stairs, and if you advance too far towards the houses, the Rifle Spear Yahar'Gul Hunter will join the fight as well.
        He also uses Ludwig's Rifle, meaning he can hit you from a considerable distance with shotgun pellets no matter what mode he uses for the Rifle Spear.

        Saw Cleaver
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used in the hunting business. 
        This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts, transforms into a long cleaver that makes use of centrifugal force. 
        The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness the more grotesquely transformed the beast."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired as a gift from the Messengers the first time you visit the Hunter's Dream.
        If you don't select it, you may buy it after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne.)
        
        
        
        The Saw Cleaver is the Trick Weapon featured on the title screen.
        It was also one of the first weapons to be revealed for this game.
        Overall the mechanisms of this weapon didn't change at all, starting all the way back when Bloodborne was still known as "Project Beast."
        According to the concept art, the Saw Cleaver uses a trigger mechanism to unlock the joint during transformation.
        The design of the Saw Cleaver seems to be inspired by multiple references:
        The transformed cleaver shows a resemblance to LB-66 MOONLIGHT from Armored Core V.
        The Japanese name is written as "nokogiri nata" („Éé„Ç≥„ÇÆ„É™Èâà) or "saw hatchet". Nokogiri is a traditional Japanese saw that cuts from the pull stroke, as opposed to the more common push stroke.
        In real life, there is a type of cleaver known as a mezzaluna ("half moon") cleaver, known for chopping/mincing up various food products.
        Most of these types of cleavers have handles on both ends.
        However, some use a single handle that stretches across the blade, which was used to chop up herbs usually; the saw cleaver follows this particular model.
        Coincidentally, the Strength/Skill/Arcane scaling at maximum level is "CDC" in their respective order.
        The CDC is an American organization designed to combat and prevent "health threats" of varying natures.
        Since the beast scourge acts like a plague (and is spread due to blood-related reasons), those who wield the Saw Cleaver can be thought of as fighting a dangerous epidemic.
        Henryk uses this weapon when he fights you and Eileen the Crow during her questline, as well as when he is summoned by you when using the Old Hunter Bell.

        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used by those who dedicate themselves to the hunt. This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts, transforms into a medium-range spear. The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness the more grotesquely transformed the beast."
        
        
        
        Can be bought from the Bath Messengers, after obtaining the Saw Hunter Badge, for 1,000 Blood Echoes.
        Treasure in Central Yharnam Sewer, on the ledge above the dead end with boats. You also need to cut down the corpse hanging from the rafters high above.

        Simon's Bowblade
        
        
        Choice weapon of Simon, one of the first Healing Church hunters.
        Simon despised firearms, and so the Church workshop had this specially fashioned to his liking. The large curved blade serves as a bow when transformed.
        But aside from a few close friends, Simon was scoffed at for his choice of arms, for who would dare face the beasts with a measly bow?"
        
        
        
        Fishing Hamlet: Found on the body of Simon the Harrowed next to the Lighthouse Hut lantern after answering the first option at the Hunter's Nightmare shortcut and going through his quest-line. Interact with him as he lies on the ground to obtain the weapon.
        You may also kill Simon the Harrowed at The Hunter's Nightmare or Research Hall to obtain the weapon.
        
        
        
        Simon's Bowblade is the only weapon to have a S-scaling for two attributes (Skill and Bloodtinge respectively) when fully upgraded

        Stake Driver
        
        
        A trick weapon fashioned by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. Favored by the retired hunter Djura. 
        The stake driver, with its queerly complex design, violently drives thick stakes into the flesh of foes. 
        The stake driver allows for high-damage critical attacks, but is difficult to use and leaves its wielder wide open, but none of this should bother a mere Powder Keg."
        
        
        
        Obtain Powder Keg Hunter Badge to unlock for purchase at the Messengers for 8,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Stake Driver is exclusively wielded by Djura when he is still hostile towards you.
        His fight is tricky because the area around him is very limited, meaning you can fall to your death if you're not careful.
        Furthermore, the limited space is perfect for his choice of weapon which has a short range.
        This is modeled after the "Pile Bunker," a type of fictional weaponry which launches piston with gunpowder or explosion.
        In the Japanese version of Bloodborne, this weapon is literally called the Pile Hammer („Éë„Ç§„É´„Éè„É≥„Éû„Éº).
        It bears a striking resemblance to the "Parrying Blade" weapons seen in several "Armored Core" games.
        Has the highest charged attack multiplier out of any other weapon.

        Threaded Cane
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used by hunters on their duties. Sufficiently deadly as a rigid bladed cane, but also serves as a whip when its blade is split into many. Concealing the weapon inside the cane and flogging the beasts with the whip is partly an act of ceremony, an attempt to demonstrate to oneself that the bloodlust of the hunt will never encroach upon the soul."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired at the beginning of the game as a gift from the Messengers.
        If not selected, it is later available for purchase from the blood fountain messengers after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne).
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is used by Iosefka, Last Scholar Yurie and the Frontier Church Hunter.
        Gehrman carries a generic cane in the Workshop instead of the Threaded Cane.
        This trick weapon is possibly inspired by the sword used by Jean-Fran√ßois de Morangias in the climactic battle of French action-horror film Brotherhood of the Wolf (which bears many other similarities to Bloodborne), or the sword used by a bandit leader in the anime/manga series Claymore. Both these weapons act as a straight, double-edged sword that can transform into a segmented, bladed whip.

        Tonitrus
        
        
        "A unique trick weapon contrived by Archibald, the infamous eccentric of the Healing Church workshop. 
        Striking this peculiar iron morning star flail like a match generates the same blue sparks that blanket a darkbeast. 
        Unfortunately, for reasons untold, the hunters of Archibald's time did not fully take to the device."
        
        
        
        Acquire the Spark Hunter Badge by defeating Darkbeast Paarl  to purchase from Messengers.
        Treasure: Yahar'gul, Unseen Village, at the top end of the road. (guarded by 2 Tainted Dogs and a Snatcher during daytime)
        
        
        
        Tonitrus is a Latin word meaning "thunder."
        The in-game description classifies this trick weapon as a morning star flail, but it's actually modeled in the form of a mace.
        The description of Archibald bears many similarities to Nikola Tesla, a famed inventor in real life who specialized in the field of electricity.
        Nikola Tesla created the Tesla Coil, a device that also bears many similarities to the Tonitrus.
        The Tonitrus also bears similarities with the aspergillum, a device used by the Roman Catholic Church to sprinkle holy water.
        According to the description of the Spark Hunter Badge, Archibald was associated with the Healing Church.
        In this sense, it may have been designed under the themes of "purificiation" and "cleansing" that is associated with many Healing Church trick weapons/tools.
        However, due to Archibald's fascination with Dark Beasts, it's more likely he designed the Tonitrus as a measure to replicate the sparks these creatures could unleash.

        Whirligig Saw
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs, and weapon of choice of the Old Hunter Valtr, the Beast Eater. 
        This weapon pummels beasts in its mace form, but its true strength lies in its attached mechanical saws. 
        These discs, lined with serrated teeth,spin rapidly, thrashing the flesh of beasts into fine shreds."
        
        
        
        From the Nightmare Church go down the stairs and follow the path. Drop down into the pools of blood of follow the path further until you reach the Cannon Executioner. Follow the left wall and turn down the path, the weapon is at the end.
        
        
        
        If you use the L2 buzzsaw attack against Orphan of Kos and hold it in place, it attempts to make an immediate counterattack for each time it gets hit by the whirring blades, only to get interrupted by the next hit. It shrieks every time it attacks, so as a result, it lets loose dozens of overlapping shriek sound effects for as long as you hold it in place.
        A whirligig is defined as a toy that is constantly spinning, such as a top or pinwheel, or as something regarded as hectic and constantly changing.
        Similar to most Powder Keg weapons sharing homage to Armored Core weapons, the Whirligig Saw is based on the Grind Blade.

        Crafted by chiseling the long bones of an undead darkbeast and fastening them to the weapon. The bones are still alive, and when unleashed, grant its wielder a spurt of beastly power.

        Can be bought from messengers for 34000 echoes after acquisition.
        Can be bought from messengers after co-operation with player who has them. This only occurs in Hunter's dream before fight with Gehrman or Moon Presence. It is not needed to complete any Chalice Dungeons. It is unknown if this is glitch or intentional. Was patched by 1.07 or 1.08.
        
        
        
        When this weapon is equipped, your gloves will be replaced by two bone gauntlets. This can allow for the lost art of rapid glove changing if you switch your weapons really fast.

        Beasthunter Saif
        
        
        A trick weapon used by the old hunters. 
        A second blade is found inside the curve of the main one. In its initial form, the saif can be wielded like a long curved sword, but when transformed, its blade is contracted, allowing for quick, repeated stabs. 
        Although this trick weapon allows for adaptive combat, it was later replaced by saws and similar weapons that were more effective at disposing of beasts."

        Beast Cutter
        
        
        A trick weapon used by Old Hunters. 
        This thick iron cleaver slices through the toughest of beast hides, and when transformed the blade splits into sections, allowing one to lash it in the fashion of a heavy whip. 
        This crude weapon relies on brute force and is regrettably inelegant, suggesting that the hunts of the earliest hunters made for horrific affairs, painted in sanguine black and reds."
        
        
        
        When walking up the stairs to the nightmare version of the Grand Cathedral, turn left onto a small platform, then roll off and walk down some rough terrain to find the weapon on a corpse.
        
        
        
        Reminds many of the Zanpakut≈ç , a fictional segmented sword that can function as a whip. It is an iconic weapon from the Bleach anime.
        The untransformed form of the weapon is a cleaver-like serrated club, and it really looks like the samoan war club "Nifo Oti".

        Blade of mercy
        
        
        A special trick weapon passed down among hunters of hunters. One of the oldest weapons of the workshop. 
        Splits into two when activated. The weapon's warped blades are forged with siderite, a rare mineral of the heavens. Most effective swift attacks,such as after a quick-stepping."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers for 40000 echoes after obtaining the Crow Hunter Badge from Eileen the Crow's quest line.
        Killing Eileen is also a way to get the weapon early in the game.
        While progressing through Eileen's quest, it's possible for her to be killed by Henryk and thus drop the Crow Hunter Badge as a result, although the quest line will end.
        
        
        
        The Blade of Mercy was originally named as "Warped Twinblades" during the Alpha test, and it was the tool of choice for the "agile" hunter.
        Both the Burial Blade and Blade of Mercy make mentions of a mineral known as siderite in their descriptions.
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite, and it seems to be the reason why arcane power has direct scaling with both blade's damage output. Due to its extraterrestrial origins, that may explain why it cannot be buffed by an external source of any sort.
        It loosely resembles the Eleum Loyce from Dark Souls 2, a sword with two blades at the front.

        Bloodletter
        
        
        The demented hunter weapon brandished by Brador, the Healing Church assassin. 
        The Bloodletter assumes its true and terrifying form after it draws upon blood from the inner reaches of one's body and soul. 
        This is the only effective means of expelling tainted blood, or so Brador, isolated in his cell, continued to believe."
        
        
        
        Obtain the underground cell inner chamber key.
        Return to the underground prison (from the underground corpse pile lamp, go up the stairs and turn left) and open the door to Brador's cell. His cell is the second on the left behind a flight of downward stairs. Kill Brador to obtain the bloodletter.
        Brador will not be hostile in his cell, but will invade the player right outside his cell.

        A trick weapon used by the old hunters, and crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. 
        A giant hammer equipped with a miniature furnace. When ignited and fired, it emits a volley of flame that explodes furiously upon impact. 
        Crush the beasts, then burn them - the brute simplicity of the Boom Hammer was favored by hunters with an acute distaste for beasts."

Be sure to shoot the explosives around the item (or act fast), as the wheelchair huntsman's corpse conceals a delayed molotov set to trigger when you try to grab the Boom Hammer, potential killing you in a huge blast.

        Burial Blade
        
        
        Trick weapon wielded by Gehrman, the first hunter." 
        A masterpiece that defined the entire array of weapons crafted at the workshop. Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens. 
        Gehrman surely saw the hunt as a dirge of farewell, wishing only that his prey might rest in peace, never again to awaken to another harrowing nightmare. "
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 60,000 Blood Echoes after defeating Gehrman, the First Hunter and acquiring the Old Hunter Badge from him.
        To make Gehrman fight you, the "Refuse" option must be selected.
        If one accepts his proposal, the game will outright end there and it will be impossible to obtain this weapon in that playthrough (not including the uncanny/lost forms found in the chalice dungeons).
        Normally, the Burial Blade can only be obtained in NG+ and beyond. However, one can bypass this by using Bold Hunter's Mark, or being killed, during The Moon Presence boss battle.
        
        
        
         The Burial Blade was the first trick weapon ever created, and it inspired others to develop new trick weapons, usually on the premise of adapting to different combat scenerios.
        Not all weapons adapt to different combat scenerios (e.g. Tonitrus), but the Burial Blade still inspired an entire series of weapons that could "transform" to satisfy different purposes.
        It was created, and exclusively wielded, by Gehrman.
        A Burial Blade can be found above the workshop table in the Hunter's Dream.
        The weapon's description mentions that "Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens."
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite. Due to its extraterrestrial nature, it could be the reason why it has direct scaling with arcane and cannot be tampered by external sources.
        Both the Burial Blade and the Blade of Mercy mentions the use of it in their descriptions.
        Interestingly enough, these two weapons also resemble the talons of Mergo's Wet Nurse.
        The shape of the scythe highly resembles Rurufon's scythe from Shadow Tower Abyss, an early title created by From Software as well as being recurring weapons in Souls series.
        A strange bug on rare occurrences the cape on the hunter may come off, usually in a boss fight you could notice if you dodge back and do an R1 combo the cape disappears. [Note, I haven't seen this happen in a while, it's possible that it may have been fixed, but I'll need confirmation on this]

        Chikage
        
        
        Foreign-made weapon wielded by the royal guards who protect Annalise, Queen of the Vilebloods at Cainhurst Castle. 
        When the intricate, rippled engraving that spans the Chikage's blade is imbrued with blood, the sword sings in scarlet hues. 
        However, the rite eats away at the wielder's very essence."
        
        
        
        Join the Cainhurst Vilebloods covenant available at Cainhurst Castle, and then purchase from the Messengers for 50,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Chikage isn't actually a katana - it is a katana/european sword hybrid. Its short crossguard resembles the one of an early viking sword, or the one of a xiphos (greek sword). The closest european crossguard shape with  this sword is the one of a Karabela (a polish sabre). In other hand, the  hilt and pommel resemble the ones of a longsword (a bit longer, to get easier katana traditional jutsu swings), while the blade shape and the 2-handed fighting style is very similar to a katana. A possible explanation for the origin of this hybrid is that the katana's design was imported to Cainhurst, where some modifications were made to create a sword similar to that commonly used by their knights.
        The Chikage is an allusion to a particular 'breed' of Katanas in the Souls games. While it is similar to both the Hiltless and Chaos Blade from Demon's Souls and Dark Souls respectively, the Chikage bears a stronger resemblance to the Magic Sword "Makoto" (also from Demon's Souls). The Makoto is the only one the bunch to actually DRAIN the user's HP over time, rather than decrease it with each successful swing.
        Chikage (ÂçÉÊôØ) literally means "Thousands Views", however if you separated the word into Chi Kage (Ë°ÄÂΩ±), it means "Blood Shadow". This could be correlated to the fact that Shadows Of Yharnam wield a similar katana with a slight  crossguard, however without using the bloodtinge.
        The transforming attack has the hunter sheathe the Chikage before unleashing a strike. This is a reference to Iaijutsu, a traditional Japanese sword technique that focuses on quick-drawing. At its finest, Iaijutse allows the warrior to unsheathe and strike at incredible speeds.
        The name seems to be a tribute to Chikage Yamamura (mentioned as a "special thanks" in credits)
        The name may also be a reference to the work "1000 Plateaus" by Giles Deluze and Felix Guattari, a famous philosophical essay about fluidity and functionality, maybe dirrectly tied to the esoteric nature of the weapons function.

        Church Pick
        
        
        One of the old trick weapons of the Healing Church, a hunting weapon formed from one of the giant picks that appear in old beast tales. 
        The Church Pick initially serves as a large sword, but when transformed functions as an extended war pick. In spite of its origins, it is a highly practical weapon."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Dropped by a hunter wearing Yahar'Gul set (presumably, this is the summonable Old Hunter Defector Antal) in one of the cells that you open with the Underground Cell Key from the Research Hall. To make this battle simple, attack him through the door with a strong R2 attack, then leave the room. He will lose sight of you and his AI will return to a standstill behind the door. Rinse and repeat until dead.
        
        
        
        The Church Pick And The Hunter's Axe both have similar appearance. When transformed, both are wielded as a polearm and have the same de-transformation attack. The only difference apart from the Church Pick having a slightly more complicated mechanism is that the Hunter's Axe is a strength-based weapon.
        A few of its attacks in the transformed mode are very similar to that of the Burial Blade.

        Holy Moonlight Sword
        
        
        An arcane sword discovered long ago by Ludwig. 
        When blue moonlight dances around the sword, and it channels the abyssal cosmos, its great blade will hurl a shadowy lightwave. 
        The Holy Moonlight Sword is synonymous with Ludwig, the Holy Blade, but few have ever set eyes on the great blade, and whatever guidance it has to offer, it seems to be of a very private, elusive sort."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Found on the Underground Corpse Pile after the fight against Ludwig, The Holy Blade. Ludwig's head will be lying there and you can:
        Kill the head for the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and talk to the head. When prompted, reply "Yes" and you'll get the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and reply "No", then come back later and Simon the Harrowed will be there and give you the sword.
        NOTE: This weapon is missable. If Lawrence is killed before you obtain it, you will no longer be able to talk to the head or obtain it from Simon.
        
        
        
        It seems to be another reappearance of the Moonlight Greatsword, a recurring item found around FromSoftware's games. Notable examples of such games include the first, second and third Dark Souls games, Demon's Souls, King's Field, Ninja Blade, Enchanted Arms, Armored Core, 3D Dot Game Heroes, and Otogi.

        Hunter Axe
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used on the hunt. Retains the qualities of an axe, but offers a wider palette of attacks by transforming. Boasts a heavy blunt attack, leading to high rally potential. No matter their pasts, beasts are no more than beasts. Some choose this axe to play the part of executioner."
        
        
        
        It's possible to pick this trick weapon as a starting weapon near the beginning of Bloodborne.
        If not chosen, it can instead be purchased from the Messengers after the Hunter has found the Saw Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is wielded by Father Gascoigne.
        However, he has a moveset that is different from the Hunter's version.
        He is also capable of using his unique Hunter Pistol even while his Hunter Axe is transformed, which is impossible for the Hunter to do.
        It's also wielded by the Madara's Twin who drops Madara's Whistle when defeated.
        Another hostile hunter NPC wields this trick weapon in the Nightmare Frontier.
        It's been heavily debated by the fanbase whether the transformed mode is a halberd or poleaxe.
        Both forms utilized axe heads with a spear tip at the end (although some poleaxes used hammer heads instead).
        However, neither weapon was known to have extendable handles, which is a special trademark of the Hunter Axe.
        In either case, it's possible this trick weapon was inspired by both weapons and simply incorporated many different designs.
        While wielded in it's transformed mode if the player had a torch equipped in the off-hand beasts afraid of the fire will still recoil in fear of you as if you were brandishing the torch normally (Tested on Beast Patient)

        Kirkhammer
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. On the one side, an easily handled silver sword. On the other, a giant obtuse stone weapon, characterized by a blunt strike and extreme force of impact. The Church takes a heavy-handed, merciless stance toward the plague of beasts, an irony not lost upon the wielders of this most symbolic weapon."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers after acquiring the Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        A miniature of the Kirkhammer was included as the Pre-Order Bonus for Asian editions of Bloodborne. [See the Bundles page for details]
        A "kirk" is an archaic old english word meaning "church."
        This means the weapon is literately known as the Church Hammer.
        The wording also might be a nod to Nordic culture since the word "Kirk" originated from northern England and Old Norse wording.
        The etched wording on the side of the hammer part has similarities to the Old Norse alphabet.
        However, it also has similarities to the Elder Futhark, one of the oldest forms of the runic alphabet system used by Germanic tribes.
        Similar etchings can be found on gravestones all over Yharnam.
        The sword used for this weapon is very similar to the one used for Ludwig's Holy Blade.
        This suggests that the Healing Church used the method of "interchangeable parts" to efficiently mass produce weapons for their hunters.
        However, the sword used for the Kirkhammer is shorter.
        It's wielded by Alfred, should you choose to be friends with him.
        He uses this weapon as a summon.
        However, he wields the Logarius' Wheel if you find him in Cainhurst Castle under special circumstances.
        When untransformed, with the hammer part on the character's back, some cloth parts (capes etc.) of the armor can either get awkwardly stuck on it or cover it.
        Despite being labeled a 'stone weapon', the etchings, wear, and sound produced when it strikes indicate that the hammer is in fact made of metal.

        Kos Parasite
        
        
        When the carcass of Kos washed up on the coast, its insides were teeming with tiny parasites, unlike any found in humans. 
        This atypical weapon can only be clasped tight and swung, but a Kos Parasite is said to stimulate phantasms inhabiting a lumenwood"

        Logarius's Wheel
        
        
        "Weapon wielded by martyr Logarius' band of executioners. 
        Used to slaughter the Vilebloods in Cainhurst. Bathed in pools of their blood, and forever steeped in their ire. 
        Transform to release the power of the wheel and manifest their lingering rage in a show of utter brilliance."
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 13,000 Blood Echoes after acquiring the Wheel Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        Alfred utilizes the Logarius' Wheel when found in Cainhurst Castle.
        This weapon is yet another reference to Berserk, as they are often made in Miyazaki's previous Souls games.
        "Logarius and his band of executioners" bear many similarities to Mozgus, an insanely devout man who traveled the land torturing heretics along with his disciples.
        The wheel in particular was wielded by one of his six disciples, .
        In Dark Souls, Bonewheel Skeletons are another reference to Mozgus' disciples.
        In real life, although wheels weren't typically wielded as weapons, they were commonly used as torture devices, especially during the Middle Ages.
        Torture wheels were nicknamed "breaking wheels," since victims often times would have their limbs broken during the process.
        They were also known as "catherine wheels."
         It's quite possible that Logarius' Wheel also takes some inspiration in its use as a weapon from the English folklore legend of Tom Hickathrift. Tom was a fabled giant killer who made use of a cartwheel to vanquish the Wisbech Giant (also referred to as an ogre).
        Lore theories can be found under "From Berserk to Bloodborne".

        Ludwig's Holy Blade
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. It is said that the silver sword was employed by Ludwig, the first hunter of the church. When transformed, it combines with its sheath to form a greatsword. 
        It exhibits several departures from the workshop's design, suggesting that the Church anticipated much larger inhuman beasts."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased for 20,000 echoes from the Messengers after obtaining the Radiant Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon was wielded by Ludwig, a famous hunter of the Healing Church who designed the blade based on the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        According to the description, Ludwig wielded this sword in combat instead of the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        However, in his boss fight, he wields the Holy Moonlight Sword during a certain part in the fight.
        It is possible that Ludwig wielded the Holy Moonlight Sword and his fellow hunters, inspired by the huge weapon, sought to make replicas. Unable to make a magic sword, a huge metal sheath was the compromise.
        Before the DLC's release, Ludwig's Holy Blade was thought of as From Software's traditional "Moonlight Greatsword" seen throughout various games by the fanbase.
        However, this sword was eventually revealed in the DLC to be a replica of the "true" Moonlight Greatsword in Bloodborne, the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        This isn't the first time Miyazaki used the name of classical music composers in a game.
        A boss from the first "Dark Souls" game, Dragonslayer Ornstein, is named after Leo Ornstein.
        Berlioz from "Armored Core 4" is named after Hector Berlioz.
        The normal form of this weapon is very similar to the sword used for the Kirkhammer.
        However, this sword's normal form has a slightly longer reach when compared to the Kirkhammer's blade.
        The similar nature of these swords suggests that the Healing Church used the method of interchangeable parts to quickly mass produce weapons for their hunters.

        Rakuyo
        
        
        Hunter weapon wielded by Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower. 
        A trick sword originated in the same country as the Cainhurst Chikage, only this sword feeds not off blood, but instead demands great dexterity. 
        Lady Maria was fond of this aspect of the Rakuyo, as she frowned upon blood blades, despite being a distant relative of the queen. 
        One day, she abandoned her beloved Rakuyo, casting it into a dark well, when she could stomach it no longer."
        
        
        
        Fishing Hamlet. Get to the bottom of the well. Can be reached from the underground tunnels at the end of the area or via a ladder in the well right away. In that area a Shark Giant will wander around. Fighting him makes a second one appear after the first reaches sufficiently low health. The first giant will walk over near the ladder and scream at the ceiling, causing the second one to drop. The second one drops the weapon.
        Fighting the two of them can be difficult and it is a good idea to use the Shaman Bone Blade to make them fight each other and finish off the weaker one. Molotov cocktails are also very effective against them. If neither is available to you, try to kill the one with the anchor first, as it is significantly harder to dodge.
        One easy way to beat them is use of ranged weapon like Simon's Bowblade if you are a bloodtinge build, and the Holy Moonlight Sword if you are an arcane build.
        A Threaded Cane's transformed whip can easily hit the giants from the ledge once they're lured over and begin attacking, but be sure to keep your distance after each hit. Except that there is no way to lure them over the the ledge. No ranged weapon will hit the one standing at the back and the one hanging from the ceiling doesn't drop down until the first one is at 50% health. 
        Unlike other giants in the game, these ones are easy to gun parry for a visceral attack. Keep in mind this will get very tricky after the other one starts fighting, so try to separate them and time your viscerals to get the invincibility at the right moment.
        If your range is inadequate you can use the monocular to angle a throwing knife to be able to hit the shark giant in the back. This way, you can continue from the strategy of killing them on the ledge with a gun/magic without going around. (confirmed as of January 19th, 2019)
        Chaining together backstabs is a very effecient way of dealing with them, if played right you should be able to eliminate the first shark giant before the second reaches you this way. It is extremely difficult to get behind the patrolling Shark Giant without him detecting you.

        Rakuyo (ËêΩËëâ) literally means "falling leaf".
        The sword of Rakuyo bears resemblance to the "ky≈´ gunt≈ç", which was a hybrid of the sabre/katana with a handguard, used during the Russo-Japanese War.

        Reiterpallasch
        
        
        Weapon wielded by the Knights of Cainhurst. 
        Combines an elegant knight's sword with the peculiar firearm wielded by the Cainhurst order. 
        The old nobles, long-time imbibers of blood, are no strangers to the sanguine plague, and the disposal of beasts was a discrete task left to their servants, or knights, as they were called for the sake of appearances."
        
        
        
        It's found in a chest located in the entrance hall of Cainhurst Castle, where the Bound Widows are first encountered. When you first enter the room from the main entrance, run towards your two o'clock. The chest will be found in a corner.
        
        
        
        The Reiterpallasch (from German Reiter "horseback rider" and hungarian pallos [Ààp…ílo É] "sword") is a 17th century Hungarian straight sword with a typically double edged blade and guarded hilt that was used by Hungarian noble cavalry and later adapted by most western European armies.
        As pointed out in its description, the rifle spear is made "possibly in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon" (i.e. this one).
        Wynne D. Fanchon from Armored Core: For Answer; another From Software title, pilots a NEXT named Reiterpallasch.
        Relevant lore theories exist under The Mysteries of Cainhurst Garb and Architecture.

        Rifle Spear
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. A prototype weapon serving as a simple firearm and spear, possibly created in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon. Lacks any notable functions, saving that it is the only trick weapon with an attached gun. "
        
        
        
        It can be found inside a hidden building in Old Yharnam. From the area you fight the first NPC Hunter (who wields a saw spear), drop down where the railing is missing in a corner and land on the ledges below. Go into the building and follow the stairs up; eventually you can find it stashed on a corpse tucked away in a hidden nook as you advance.
        Bought from the messengers for 4000 blood echoes after acquiring the Powder Keg Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        According to the Rifle Spear's description, it was designed as an imitation of "a lost Cainhurst weapon".
        That particular weapon may or may not be the Reiterpallasch.
        It should be noted these two weapons are the only two skill/firearm hybrids whose alternate forms utilize guns.
        The third skill/firearm hybrid weapon in this game is Simon's Bowblade, which transforms from a sword into a bow.
        The Rifle Spear is carried by a Yahar'Gul Hunter in the Cathedral Ward.
        This fight can be tricky because you first encounter a Yahar'Gul Hunter that uses a Tonitrus near the base of the stairs, and if you advance too far towards the houses, the Rifle Spear Yahar'Gul Hunter will join the fight as well.
        He also uses Ludwig's Rifle, meaning he can hit you from a considerable distance with shotgun pellets no matter what mode he uses for the Rifle Spear.

        Saw Cleaver
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used in the hunting business. 
        This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts, transforms into a long cleaver that makes use of centrifugal force. 
        The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness the more grotesquely transformed the beast."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired as a gift from the Messengers the first time you visit the Hunter's Dream.
        If you don't select it, you may buy it after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne.)
        
        
        
        The Saw Cleaver is the Trick Weapon featured on the title screen.
        It was also one of the first weapons to be revealed for this game.
        Overall the mechanisms of this weapon didn't change at all, starting all the way back when Bloodborne was still known as "Project Beast."
        According to the concept art, the Saw Cleaver uses a trigger mechanism to unlock the joint during transformation.
        The design of the Saw Cleaver seems to be inspired by multiple references:
        The transformed cleaver shows a resemblance to LB-66 MOONLIGHT from Armored Core V.
        The Japanese name is written as "nokogiri nata" („Éé„Ç≥„ÇÆ„É™Èâà) or "saw hatchet". Nokogiri is a traditional Japanese saw that cuts from the pull stroke, as opposed to the more common push stroke.
        In real life, there is a type of cleaver known as a mezzaluna ("half moon") cleaver, known for chopping/mincing up various food products.
        Most of these types of cleavers have handles on both ends.
        However, some use a single handle that stretches across the blade, which was used to chop up herbs usually; the saw cleaver follows this particular model.
        Coincidentally, the Strength/Skill/Arcane scaling at maximum level is "CDC" in their respective order.
        The CDC is an American organization designed to combat and prevent "health threats" of varying natures.
        Since the beast scourge acts like a plague (and is spread due to blood-related reasons), those who wield the Saw Cleaver can be thought of as fighting a dangerous epidemic.
        Henryk uses this weapon when he fights you and Eileen the Crow during her questline, as well as when he is summoned by you when using the Old Hunter Bell.

        Simon's Bowblade
        
        
        Choice weapon of Simon, one of the first Healing Church hunters.
        Simon despised firearms, and so the Church workshop had this specially fashioned to his liking. The large curved blade serves as a bow when transformed.
        But aside from a few close friends, Simon was scoffed at for his choice of arms, for who would dare face the beasts with a measly bow?"

        Stake Driver
        
        
        A trick weapon fashioned by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. Favored by the retired hunter Djura. 
        The stake driver, with its queerly complex design, violently drives thick stakes into the flesh of foes. 
        The stake driver allows for high-damage critical attacks, but is difficult to use and leaves its wielder wide open, but none of this should bother a mere Powder Keg."
        
        
        
        Obtain Powder Keg Hunter Badge to unlock for purchase at the Messengers for 8,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Stake Driver is exclusively wielded by Djura when he is still hostile towards you.
        His fight is tricky because the area around him is very limited, meaning you can fall to your death if you're not careful.
        Furthermore, the limited space is perfect for his choice of weapon which has a short range.
        This is modeled after the "Pile Bunker," a type of fictional weaponry which launches piston with gunpowder or explosion.
        In the Japanese version of Bloodborne, this weapon is literally called the Pile Hammer („Éë„Ç§„É´„Éè„É≥„Éû„Éº).
        It bears a striking resemblance to the "Parrying Blade" weapons seen in several "Armored Core" games.
        Has the highest charged attack multiplier out of any other weapon.

        Threaded Cane
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used by hunters on their duties. Sufficiently deadly as a rigid bladed cane, but also serves as a whip when its blade is split into many. Concealing the weapon inside the cane and flogging the beasts with the whip is partly an act of ceremony, an attempt to demonstrate to oneself that the bloodlust of the hunt will never encroach upon the soul."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired at the beginning of the game as a gift from the Messengers.
        If not selected, it is later available for purchase from the blood fountain messengers after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne).
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is used by Iosefka, Last Scholar Yurie and the Frontier Church Hunter.
        Gehrman carries a generic cane in the Workshop instead of the Threaded Cane.
        This trick weapon is possibly inspired by the sword used by Jean-Fran√ßois de Morangias in the climactic battle of French action-horror film Brotherhood of the Wolf (which bears many other similarities to Bloodborne), or the sword used by a bandit leader in the anime/manga series Claymore. Both these weapons act as a straight, double-edged sword that can transform into a segmented, bladed whip.

        Tonitrus
        
        
        "A unique trick weapon contrived by Archibald, the infamous eccentric of the Healing Church workshop. 
        Striking this peculiar iron morning star flail like a match generates the same blue sparks that blanket a darkbeast. 
        Unfortunately, for reasons untold, the hunters of Archibald's time did not fully take to the device."
        
        
        
        Acquire the Spark Hunter Badge by defeating Darkbeast Paarl  to purchase from Messengers.
        Treasure: Yahar'gul, Unseen Village, at the top end of the road. (guarded by 2 Tainted Dogs and a Snatcher during daytime)
        
        
        
        Tonitrus is a Latin word meaning "thunder."
        The in-game description classifies this trick weapon as a morning star flail, but it's actually modeled in the form of a mace.
        The description of Archibald bears many similarities to Nikola Tesla, a famed inventor in real life who specialized in the field of electricity.
        Nikola Tesla created the Tesla Coil, a device that also bears many similarities to the Tonitrus.
        The Tonitrus also bears similarities with the aspergillum, a device used by the Roman Catholic Church to sprinkle holy water.
        According to the description of the Spark Hunter Badge, Archibald was associated with the Healing Church.
        In this sense, it may have been designed under the themes of "purificiation" and "cleansing" that is associated with many Healing Church trick weapons/tools.
        However, due to Archibald's fascination with Dark Beasts, it's more likely he designed the Tonitrus as a measure to replicate the sparks these creatures could unleash.
        
        
    

        Beast Claw
        
        
        Beastly weapon wielded by Irreverent Izzy.
        Crafted by chiseling the long bones of an undead darkbeast and fastening them to the weapon. The bones are still alive, and when unleashed, grant its wielder a spurt of beastly power. 
        As flesh is flayed and blood is sprayed, the beast within awakens, and in time, the wielder of this weapon surges with both strength and feverish reverie."
        
        
        
        Ailing Loran Chalice: Layer 2 treasure room. Room is on the right when exiting the elevator from first layer boss fight, before the second layers lantern.
        Can be bought from messengers for 34000 echoes after acquisition.
        Can be bought from messengers after co-operation with player who has them. This only occurs in Hunter's dream before fight with Gehrman or Moon Presence. It is not needed to complete any Chalice Dungeons. It is unknown if this is glitch or intentional. Was patched by 1.07 or 1.08.
        
        
        
        When this weapon is equipped, your gloves will be replaced by two bone gauntlets. This can allow for the lost art of rapid glove changing if you switch your weapons really fast.
        You can charge the beasthood meter on the first windows (Gilbert) of Central Yharnam
        In the past, there was a rare glitch that allowed a player to obtain this weapon without finding it in the Chalice Dungeons.
        It has since been patched, although it isn't quite known when it was successfully patched.

        Whirligig Saw
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs, and weapon of choice of the Old Hunter Valtr, the Beast Eater. 
        This weapon pummels beasts in its mace form, but its true strength lies in its attached mechanical saws. 
        These discs, lined with serrated teeth,spin rapidly, thrashing the flesh of beasts into fine shreds."
        
        
        
        From the Nightmare Church go down the stairs and follow the path. Drop down into the pools of blood of follow the path further until you reach the Cannon Executioner. Follow the left wall and turn down the path, the weapon is at the end.
        
        
        
        If you use the L2 buzzsaw attack against Orphan of Kos and hold it in place, it attempts to make an immediate counterattack for each time it gets hit by the whirring blades, only to get interrupted by the next hit. It shrieks every time it attacks, so as a result, it lets loose dozens of overlapping shriek sound effects for as long as you hold it in place.
        A whirligig is defined as a toy that is constantly spinning, such as a top or pinwheel, or as something regarded as hectic and constantly changing.
        Similar to most Powder Keg weapons sharing homage to Armored Core weapons, the Whirligig Saw is based on the Grind Blade.

        Amygdalan Arm 
        
        
        The arm of a small Amygdala Great One. 
        Strictly speaking, the Amygdalan Arm is no trick weapon of any sort, but certain madmen wield them like clubs. 
        Starts as a large, tough blunt weapon formed of bone, but when extended, the hand quivers as if it were still alive.
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare, cave at the end of the blood river to the right after getting out of the building that used to be the shortcut to the Cleric Beast in the main game. Gatling Gun Hunter dropping the Gatling Gun and a Blood-Starved Beast can be also found here. Arm is near the Blood-Starved Beast at the end of the cave.
        
        
        
        The Amygdalan Arm is a Trick Weapon in name only, considering that it is an arm obtained from Amygdala.
        The arm is remarkably small, as even the Lesser Amygdalae are huge. Perhaps it came from a newborn Amygdala.
        The arm could be the inspiration behind the Burial Blade.

        Beast Cutter
        
        
        A trick weapon used by Old Hunters. 
        This thick iron cleaver slices through the toughest of beast hides, and when transformed the blade splits into sections, allowing one to lash it in the fashion of a heavy whip. 
        This crude weapon relies on brute force and is regrettably inelegant, suggesting that the hunts of the earliest hunters made for horrific affairs, painted in sanguine black and reds."
        
        
        
        When walking up the stairs to the nightmare version of the Grand Cathedral, turn left onto a small platform, then roll off and walk down some rough terrain to find the weapon on a corpse.
        
        
        
        Reminds many of the Zanpakut≈ç , a fictional segmented sword that can function as a whip. It is an iconic weapon from the Bleach anime.
        The untransformed form of the weapon is a cleaver-like serrated club, and it really looks like the samoan war club "Nifo Oti".

        Blade of mercy
        
        
        A special trick weapon passed down among hunters of hunters. One of the oldest weapons of the workshop. 
        Splits into two when activated. The weapon's warped blades are forged with siderite, a rare mineral of the heavens. Most effective swift attacks,such as after a quick-stepping."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers for 40000 echoes after obtaining the Crow Hunter Badge from Eileen the Crow's quest line.
        Killing Eileen is also a way to get the weapon early in the game.
        While progressing through Eileen's quest, it's possible for her to be killed by Henryk and thus drop the Crow Hunter Badge as a result, although the quest line will end.
        
        
        
        The Blade of Mercy was originally named as "Warped Twinblades" during the Alpha test, and it was the tool of choice for the "agile" hunter.
        Both the Burial Blade and Blade of Mercy make mentions of a mineral known as siderite in their descriptions.
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite, and it seems to be the reason why arcane power has direct scaling with both blade's damage output. Due to its extraterrestrial origins, that may explain why it cannot be buffed by an external source of any sort.
        It loosely resembles the Eleum Loyce from Dark Souls 2, a sword with two blades at the front.

        This is the only effective means of expelling tainted blood, or so Brador, isolated in his cell, continued to believe."

        Return to the underground prison (from the underground corpse pile lamp, go up the stairs and turn left) and open the door to Brador's cell. His cell is the second on the left behind a flight of downward stairs. Kill Brador to obtain the bloodletter.
        Brador will not be hostile in his cell, but will invade the player right outside his cell.

        A giant hammer equipped with a miniature furnace. When ignited and fired, it emits a volley of flame that explodes furiously upon impact. 
        Crush the beasts, then burn them - the brute simplicity of the Boom Hammer was favored by hunters with an acute distaste for beasts."

        Burial Blade
        
        
        Trick weapon wielded by Gehrman, the first hunter." 
        A masterpiece that defined the entire array of weapons crafted at the workshop. Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens. 
        Gehrman surely saw the hunt as a dirge of farewell, wishing only that his prey might rest in peace, never again to awaken to another harrowing nightmare. "
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 60,000 Blood Echoes after defeating Gehrman, the First Hunter and acquiring the Old Hunter Badge from him.
        To make Gehrman fight you, the "Refuse" option must be selected.
        If one accepts his proposal, the game will outright end there and it will be impossible to obtain this weapon in that playthrough (not including the uncanny/lost forms found in the chalice dungeons).
        Normally, the Burial Blade can only be obtained in NG+ and beyond. However, one can bypass this by using Bold Hunter's Mark, or being killed, during The Moon Presence boss battle.
        
        
        
         The Burial Blade was the first trick weapon ever created, and it inspired others to develop new trick weapons, usually on the premise of adapting to different combat scenerios.
        Not all weapons adapt to different combat scenerios (e.g. Tonitrus), but the Burial Blade still inspired an entire series of weapons that could "transform" to satisfy different purposes.
        It was created, and exclusively wielded, by Gehrman.
        A Burial Blade can be found above the workshop table in the Hunter's Dream.
        The weapon's description mentions that "Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens."
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite. Due to its extraterrestrial nature, it could be the reason why it has direct scaling with arcane and cannot be tampered by external sources.
        Both the Burial Blade and the Blade of Mercy mentions the use of it in their descriptions.
        Interestingly enough, these two weapons also resemble the talons of Mergo's Wet Nurse.
        The shape of the scythe highly resembles Rurufon's scythe from Shadow Tower Abyss, an early title created by From Software as well as being recurring weapons in Souls series.
        A strange bug on rare occurrences the cape on the hunter may come off, usually in a boss fight you could notice if you dodge back and do an R1 combo the cape disappears. [Note, I haven't seen this happen in a while, it's possible that it may have been fixed, but I'll need confirmation on this]

        Chikage
        
        
        Foreign-made weapon wielded by the royal guards who protect Annalise, Queen of the Vilebloods at Cainhurst Castle. 
        When the intricate, rippled engraving that spans the Chikage's blade is imbrued with blood, the sword sings in scarlet hues. 
        However, the rite eats away at the wielder's very essence."
        
        
        
        Join the Cainhurst Vilebloods covenant available at Cainhurst Castle, and then purchase from the Messengers for 50,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Chikage isn't actually a katana - it is a katana/european sword hybrid. Its short crossguard resembles the one of an early viking sword, or the one of a xiphos (greek sword). The closest european crossguard shape with  this sword is the one of a Karabela (a polish sabre). In other hand, the  hilt and pommel resemble the ones of a longsword (a bit longer, to get easier katana traditional jutsu swings), while the blade shape and the 2-handed fighting style is very similar to a katana. A possible explanation for the origin of this hybrid is that the katana's design was imported to Cainhurst, where some modifications were made to create a sword similar to that commonly used by their knights.
        The Chikage is an allusion to a particular 'breed' of Katanas in the Souls games. While it is similar to both the Hiltless and Chaos Blade from Demon's Souls and Dark Souls respectively, the Chikage bears a stronger resemblance to the Magic Sword "Makoto" (also from Demon's Souls). The Makoto is the only one the bunch to actually DRAIN the user's HP over time, rather than decrease it with each successful swing.
        Chikage (ÂçÉÊôØ) literally means "Thousands Views", however if you separated the word into Chi Kage (Ë°ÄÂΩ±), it means "Blood Shadow". This could be correlated to the fact that Shadows Of Yharnam wield a similar katana with a slight  crossguard, however without using the bloodtinge.
        The transforming attack has the hunter sheathe the Chikage before unleashing a strike. This is a reference to Iaijutsu, a traditional Japanese sword technique that focuses on quick-drawing. At its finest, Iaijutse allows the warrior to unsheathe and strike at incredible speeds.
        The name seems to be a tribute to Chikage Yamamura (mentioned as a "special thanks" in credits)
        The name may also be a reference to the work "1000 Plateaus" by Giles Deluze and Felix Guattari, a famous philosophical essay about fluidity and functionality, maybe dirrectly tied to the esoteric nature of the weapons function.

        A trick weapon used by the old hunters. 
        A second blade is found inside the curve of the main one. In its initial form, the saif can be wielded like a long curved sword, but when transformed, its blade is contracted, allowing for quick, repeated stabs. 
        Although this trick weapon allows for adaptive combat, it was later replaced by saws and similar weapons that were more effective at disposing of beasts."

        Church Pick
        
        
        One of the old trick weapons of the Healing Church, a hunting weapon formed from one of the giant picks that appear in old beast tales. 
        The Church Pick initially serves as a large sword, but when transformed functions as an extended war pick. In spite of its origins, it is a highly practical weapon."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Dropped by a hunter wearing Yahar'Gul set (presumably, this is the summonable Old Hunter Defector Antal) in one of the cells that you open with the Underground Cell Key from the Research Hall. To make this battle simple, attack him through the door with a strong R2 attack, then leave the room. He will lose sight of you and his AI will return to a standstill behind the door. Rinse and repeat until dead.
        
        
        
        The Church Pick And The Hunter's Axe both have similar appearance. When transformed, both are wielded as a polearm and have the same de-transformation attack. The only difference apart from the Church Pick having a slightly more complicated mechanism is that the Hunter's Axe is a strength-based weapon.
        A few of its attacks in the transformed mode are very similar to that of the Burial Blade.

        Holy Moonlight Sword
        
        
        An arcane sword discovered long ago by Ludwig. 
        When blue moonlight dances around the sword, and it channels the abyssal cosmos, its great blade will hurl a shadowy lightwave. 
        The Holy Moonlight Sword is synonymous with Ludwig, the Holy Blade, but few have ever set eyes on the great blade, and whatever guidance it has to offer, it seems to be of a very private, elusive sort."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Found on the Underground Corpse Pile after the fight against Ludwig, The Holy Blade. Ludwig's head will be lying there and you can:
        Kill the head for the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and talk to the head. When prompted, reply "Yes" and you'll get the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and reply "No", then come back later and Simon the Harrowed will be there and give you the sword.
        NOTE: This weapon is missable. If Lawrence is killed before you obtain it, you will no longer be able to talk to the head or obtain it from Simon.
        
        
        
        It seems to be another reappearance of the Moonlight Greatsword, a recurring item found around FromSoftware's games. Notable examples of such games include the first, second and third Dark Souls games, Demon's Souls, King's Field, Ninja Blade, Enchanted Arms, Armored Core, 3D Dot Game Heroes, and Otogi.

        Hunter Axe
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used on the hunt. Retains the qualities of an axe, but offers a wider palette of attacks by transforming. Boasts a heavy blunt attack, leading to high rally potential. No matter their pasts, beasts are no more than beasts. Some choose this axe to play the part of executioner."
        
        
        
        It's possible to pick this trick weapon as a starting weapon near the beginning of Bloodborne.
        If not chosen, it can instead be purchased from the Messengers after the Hunter has found the Saw Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is wielded by Father Gascoigne.
        However, he has a moveset that is different from the Hunter's version.
        He is also capable of using his unique Hunter Pistol even while his Hunter Axe is transformed, which is impossible for the Hunter to do.
        It's also wielded by the Madara's Twin who drops Madara's Whistle when defeated.
        Another hostile hunter NPC wields this trick weapon in the Nightmare Frontier.
        It's been heavily debated by the fanbase whether the transformed mode is a halberd or poleaxe.
        Both forms utilized axe heads with a spear tip at the end (although some poleaxes used hammer heads instead).
        However, neither weapon was known to have extendable handles, which is a special trademark of the Hunter Axe.
        In either case, it's possible this trick weapon was inspired by both weapons and simply incorporated many different designs.
        While wielded in it's transformed mode if the player had a torch equipped in the off-hand beasts afraid of the fire will still recoil in fear of you as if you were brandishing the torch normally (Tested on Beast Patient)

        Kirkhammer
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. On the one side, an easily handled silver sword. On the other, a giant obtuse stone weapon, characterized by a blunt strike and extreme force of impact. The Church takes a heavy-handed, merciless stance toward the plague of beasts, an irony not lost upon the wielders of this most symbolic weapon."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers after acquiring the Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        A miniature of the Kirkhammer was included as the Pre-Order Bonus for Asian editions of Bloodborne. [See the Bundles page for details]
        A "kirk" is an archaic old english word meaning "church."
        This means the weapon is literately known as the Church Hammer.
        The wording also might be a nod to Nordic culture since the word "Kirk" originated from northern England and Old Norse wording.
        The etched wording on the side of the hammer part has similarities to the Old Norse alphabet.
        However, it also has similarities to the Elder Futhark, one of the oldest forms of the runic alphabet system used by Germanic tribes.
        Similar etchings can be found on gravestones all over Yharnam.
        The sword used for this weapon is very similar to the one used for Ludwig's Holy Blade.
        This suggests that the Healing Church used the method of "interchangeable parts" to efficiently mass produce weapons for their hunters.
        However, the sword used for the Kirkhammer is shorter.
        It's wielded by Alfred, should you choose to be friends with him.
        He uses this weapon as a summon.
        However, he wields the Logarius' Wheel if you find him in Cainhurst Castle under special circumstances.
        When untransformed, with the hammer part on the character's back, some cloth parts (capes etc.) of the armor can either get awkwardly stuck on it or cover it.
        Despite being labeled a 'stone weapon', the etchings, wear, and sound produced when it strikes indicate that the hammer is in fact made of metal.

        Kos Parasite
        
        
        When the carcass of Kos washed up on the coast, its insides were teeming with tiny parasites, unlike any found in humans. 
        This atypical weapon can only be clasped tight and swung, but a Kos Parasite is said to stimulate phantasms inhabiting a lumenwood"
        
        
        
        Dropped by Orphan of Kos
        
        
        
        The Kos Parasite is perhaps the most interestingly unique weapon in Bloodborne in various ways: It is one of two weapons that can reach it's full potential while using a rune (the other being Beast Claw), the weapon itself is not held, it is purely an arcane weapon, it is the only weapon directly dropped by defeating a boss, it has the highest durability of any weapon at 600 respectively, it is the only weapon to have an A-scaling of any weapon without any upgrades and is the only weapon to have an S-scaling by upgrading it twice.

        Logarius's Wheel
        
        
        "Weapon wielded by martyr Logarius' band of executioners. 
        Used to slaughter the Vilebloods in Cainhurst. Bathed in pools of their blood, and forever steeped in their ire. 
        Transform to release the power of the wheel and manifest their lingering rage in a show of utter brilliance."
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 13,000 Blood Echoes after acquiring the Wheel Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        Alfred utilizes the Logarius' Wheel when found in Cainhurst Castle.
        This weapon is yet another reference to Berserk, as they are often made in Miyazaki's previous Souls games.
        "Logarius and his band of executioners" bear many similarities to Mozgus, an insanely devout man who traveled the land torturing heretics along with his disciples.
        The wheel in particular was wielded by one of his six disciples, .
        In Dark Souls, Bonewheel Skeletons are another reference to Mozgus' disciples.
        In real life, although wheels weren't typically wielded as weapons, they were commonly used as torture devices, especially during the Middle Ages.
        Torture wheels were nicknamed "breaking wheels," since victims often times would have their limbs broken during the process.
        They were also known as "catherine wheels."
         It's quite possible that Logarius' Wheel also takes some inspiration in its use as a weapon from the English folklore legend of Tom Hickathrift. Tom was a fabled giant killer who made use of a cartwheel to vanquish the Wisbech Giant (also referred to as an ogre).
        Lore theories can be found under "From Berserk to Bloodborne".

        Ludwig's Holy Blade
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. It is said that the silver sword was employed by Ludwig, the first hunter of the church. When transformed, it combines with its sheath to form a greatsword. 
        It exhibits several departures from the workshop's design, suggesting that the Church anticipated much larger inhuman beasts."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased for 20,000 echoes from the Messengers after obtaining the Radiant Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon was wielded by Ludwig, a famous hunter of the Healing Church who designed the blade based on the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        According to the description, Ludwig wielded this sword in combat instead of the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        However, in his boss fight, he wields the Holy Moonlight Sword during a certain part in the fight.
        It is possible that Ludwig wielded the Holy Moonlight Sword and his fellow hunters, inspired by the huge weapon, sought to make replicas. Unable to make a magic sword, a huge metal sheath was the compromise.
        Before the DLC's release, Ludwig's Holy Blade was thought of as From Software's traditional "Moonlight Greatsword" seen throughout various games by the fanbase.
        However, this sword was eventually revealed in the DLC to be a replica of the "true" Moonlight Greatsword in Bloodborne, the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        This isn't the first time Miyazaki used the name of classical music composers in a game.
        A boss from the first "Dark Souls" game, Dragonslayer Ornstein, is named after Leo Ornstein.
        Berlioz from "Armored Core 4" is named after Hector Berlioz.
        The normal form of this weapon is very similar to the sword used for the Kirkhammer.
        However, this sword's normal form has a slightly longer reach when compared to the Kirkhammer's blade.
        The similar nature of these swords suggests that the Healing Church used the method of interchangeable parts to quickly mass produce weapons for their hunters.

        Rakuyo
        
        
        Hunter weapon wielded by Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower. 
        A trick sword originated in the same country as the Cainhurst Chikage, only this sword feeds not off blood, but instead demands great dexterity. 
        Lady Maria was fond of this aspect of the Rakuyo, as she frowned upon blood blades, despite being a distant relative of the queen. 
        One day, she abandoned her beloved Rakuyo, casting it into a dark well, when she could stomach it no longer."
        
        
        
        Fishing Hamlet. Get to the bottom of the well. Can be reached from the underground tunnels at the end of the area or via a ladder in the well right away. In that area a Shark Giant will wander around. Fighting him makes a second one appear after the first reaches sufficiently low health. The first giant will walk over near the ladder and scream at the ceiling, causing the second one to drop. The second one drops the weapon.
        Fighting the two of them can be difficult and it is a good idea to use the Shaman Bone Blade to make them fight each other and finish off the weaker one. Molotov cocktails are also very effective against them. If neither is available to you, try to kill the one with the anchor first, as it is significantly harder to dodge.
        One easy way to beat them is use of ranged weapon like Simon's Bowblade if you are a bloodtinge build, and the Holy Moonlight Sword if you are an arcane build.
        A Threaded Cane's transformed whip can easily hit the giants from the ledge once they're lured over and begin attacking, but be sure to keep your distance after each hit. Except that there is no way to lure them over the the ledge. No ranged weapon will hit the one standing at the back and the one hanging from the ceiling doesn't drop down until the first one is at 50% health. 
        Unlike other giants in the game, these ones are easy to gun parry for a visceral attack. Keep in mind this will get very tricky after the other one starts fighting, so try to separate them and time your viscerals to get the invincibility at the right moment.
        If your range is inadequate you can use the monocular to angle a throwing knife to be able to hit the shark giant in the back. This way, you can continue from the strategy of killing them on the ledge with a gun/magic without going around. (confirmed as of January 19th, 2019)
        Chaining together backstabs is a very effecient way of dealing with them, if played right you should be able to eliminate the first shark giant before the second reaches you this way. It is extremely difficult to get behind the patrolling Shark Giant without him detecting you.

        Rakuyo (ËêΩËëâ) literally means "falling leaf".

        The old nobles, long-time imbibers of blood, are no strangers to the sanguine plague, and the disposal of beasts was a discrete task left to their servants, or knights, as they were called for the sake of appearances."
        
        
        
        It's found in a chest located in the entrance hall of Cainhurst Castle, where the Bound Widows are first encountered. When you first enter the room from the main entrance, run towards your two o'clock. The chest will be found in a corner.
        
        
        
        The Reiterpallasch (from German Reiter "horseback rider" and hungarian pallos [Ààp…ílo É] "sword") is a 17th century Hungarian straight sword with a typically double edged blade and guarded hilt that was used by Hungarian noble cavalry and later adapted by most western European armies.
        As pointed out in its description, the rifle spear is made "possibly in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon" (i.e. this one).
        Wynne D. Fanchon from Armored Core: For Answer; another From Software title, pilots a NEXT named Reiterpallasch.

        Rifle Spear
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. A prototype weapon serving as a simple firearm and spear, possibly created in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon. Lacks any notable functions, saving that it is the only trick weapon with an attached gun. "
        
        
        
        It can be found inside a hidden building in Old Yharnam. From the area you fight the first NPC Hunter (who wields a saw spear), drop down where the railing is missing in a corner and land on the ledges below. Go into the building and follow the stairs up; eventually you can find it stashed on a corpse tucked away in a hidden nook as you advance.
        Bought from the messengers for 4000 blood echoes after acquiring the Powder Keg Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        According to the Rifle Spear's description, it was designed as an imitation of "a lost Cainhurst weapon".
        That particular weapon may or may not be the Reiterpallasch.
        It should be noted these two weapons are the only two skill/firearm hybrids whose alternate forms utilize guns.
        The third skill/firearm hybrid weapon in this game is Simon's Bowblade, which transforms from a sword into a bow.
        The Rifle Spear is carried by a Yahar'Gul Hunter in the Cathedral Ward.
        This fight can be tricky because you first encounter a Yahar'Gul Hunter that uses a Tonitrus near the base of the stairs, and if you advance too far towards the houses, the Rifle Spear Yahar'Gul Hunter will join the fight as well.
        He also uses Ludwig's Rifle, meaning he can hit you from a considerable distance with shotgun pellets no matter what mode he uses for the Rifle Spear.

        Saw Cleaver
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used in the hunting business. 
        This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts, transforms into a long cleaver that makes use of centrifugal force. 
        The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness the more grotesquely transformed the beast."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired as a gift from the Messengers the first time you visit the Hunter's Dream.
        If you don't select it, you may buy it after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne.)
        
        
        
        The Saw Cleaver is the Trick Weapon featured on the title screen.
        It was also one of the first weapons to be revealed for this game.
        Overall the mechanisms of this weapon didn't change at all, starting all the way back when Bloodborne was still known as "Project Beast."
        According to the concept art, the Saw Cleaver uses a trigger mechanism to unlock the joint during transformation.
        The design of the Saw Cleaver seems to be inspired by multiple references:
        The transformed cleaver shows a resemblance to LB-66 MOONLIGHT from Armored Core V.
        The Japanese name is written as "nokogiri nata" („Éé„Ç≥„ÇÆ„É™Èâà) or "saw hatchet". Nokogiri is a traditional Japanese saw that cuts from the pull stroke, as opposed to the more common push stroke.
        In real life, there is a type of cleaver known as a mezzaluna ("half moon") cleaver, known for chopping/mincing up various food products.
        Most of these types of cleavers have handles on both ends.
        However, some use a single handle that stretches across the blade, which was used to chop up herbs usually; the saw cleaver follows this particular model.
        Coincidentally, the Strength/Skill/Arcane scaling at maximum level is "CDC" in their respective order.
        The CDC is an American organization designed to combat and prevent "health threats" of varying natures.
        Since the beast scourge acts like a plague (and is spread due to blood-related reasons), those who wield the Saw Cleaver can be thought of as fighting a dangerous epidemic.
        Henryk uses this weapon when he fights you and Eileen the Crow during her questline, as well as when he is summoned by you when using the Old Hunter Bell.

        Simon's Bowblade
        
        
        Choice weapon of Simon, one of the first Healing Church hunters.
        Simon despised firearms, and so the Church workshop had this specially fashioned to his liking. The large curved blade serves as a bow when transformed.
        But aside from a few close friends, Simon was scoffed at for his choice of arms, for who would dare face the beasts with a measly bow?"

        Stake Driver
        
        
        A trick weapon fashioned by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. Favored by the retired hunter Djura. 
        The stake driver, with its queerly complex design, violently drives thick stakes into the flesh of foes. 
        The stake driver allows for high-damage critical attacks, but is difficult to use and leaves its wielder wide open, but none of this should bother a mere Powder Keg."
        
        
        
        Obtain Powder Keg Hunter Badge to unlock for purchase at the Messengers for 8,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Stake Driver is exclusively wielded by Djura when he is still hostile towards you.
        His fight is tricky because the area around him is very limited, meaning you can fall to your death if you're not careful.
        Furthermore, the limited space is perfect for his choice of weapon which has a short range.
        This is modeled after the "Pile Bunker," a type of fictional weaponry which launches piston with gunpowder or explosion.
        In the Japanese version of Bloodborne, this weapon is literally called the Pile Hammer („Éë„Ç§„É´„Éè„É≥„Éû„Éº).
        It bears a striking resemblance to the "Parrying Blade" weapons seen in several "Armored Core" games.
        Has the highest charged attack multiplier out of any other weapon.

        Threaded Cane
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used by hunters on their duties. Sufficiently deadly as a rigid bladed cane, but also serves as a whip when its blade is split into many. Concealing the weapon inside the cane and flogging the beasts with the whip is partly an act of ceremony, an attempt to demonstrate to oneself that the bloodlust of the hunt will never encroach upon the soul."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired at the beginning of the game as a gift from the Messengers.
        If not selected, it is later available for purchase from the blood fountain messengers after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne).
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is used by Iosefka, Last Scholar Yurie and the Frontier Church Hunter.
        Gehrman carries a generic cane in the Workshop instead of the Threaded Cane.
        This trick weapon is possibly inspired by the sword used by Jean-Fran√ßois de Morangias in the climactic battle of French action-horror film Brotherhood of the Wolf (which bears many other similarities to Bloodborne), or the sword used by a bandit leader in the anime/manga series Claymore. Both these weapons act as a straight, double-edged sword that can transform into a segmented, bladed whip.

        Tonitrus
        
        
        "A unique trick weapon contrived by Archibald, the infamous eccentric of the Healing Church workshop. 
        Striking this peculiar iron morning star flail like a match generates the same blue sparks that blanket a darkbeast. 
        Unfortunately, for reasons untold, the hunters of Archibald's time did not fully take to the device."
        
        
        
        Acquire the Spark Hunter Badge by defeating Darkbeast Paarl  to purchase from Messengers.
        Treasure: Yahar'gul, Unseen Village, at the top end of the road. (guarded by 2 Tainted Dogs and a Snatcher during daytime)
        
        
        
        Tonitrus is a Latin word meaning "thunder."
        The in-game description classifies this trick weapon as a morning star flail, but it's actually modeled in the form of a mace.
        The description of Archibald bears many similarities to Nikola Tesla, a famed inventor in real life who specialized in the field of electricity.
        Nikola Tesla created the Tesla Coil, a device that also bears many similarities to the Tonitrus.
        The Tonitrus also bears similarities with the aspergillum, a device used by the Roman Catholic Church to sprinkle holy water.
        According to the description of the Spark Hunter Badge, Archibald was associated with the Healing Church.
        In this sense, it may have been designed under the themes of "purificiation" and "cleansing" that is associated with many Healing Church trick weapons/tools.
        However, due to Archibald's fascination with Dark Beasts, it's more likely he designed the Tonitrus as a measure to replicate the sparks these creatures could unleash.

        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs, and weapon of choice of the Old Hunter Valtr, the Beast Eater. 
        This weapon pummels beasts in its mace form, but its true strength lies in its attached mechanical saws. 
        These discs, lined with serrated teeth,spin rapidly, thrashing the flesh of beasts into fine shreds."

        If you use the L2 buzzsaw attack against Orphan of Kos and hold it in place, it attempts to make an immediate counterattack for each time it gets hit by the whirring blades, only to get interrupted by the next hit. It shrieks every time it attacks, so as a result, it lets loose dozens of overlapping shriek sound effects for as long as you hold it in place.
        A whirligig is defined as a toy that is constantly spinning, such as a top or pinwheel, or as something regarded as hectic and constantly changing.
        Similar to most Powder Keg weapons sharing homage to Armored Core weapons, the Whirligig Saw is based on the Grind Blade.
        
    

        Beast Cutter
        
        
        A trick weapon used by Old Hunters. 
        This thick iron cleaver slices through the toughest of beast hides, and when transformed the blade splits into sections, allowing one to lash it in the fashion of a heavy whip. 
        This crude weapon relies on brute force and is regrettably inelegant, suggesting that the hunts of the earliest hunters made for horrific affairs, painted in sanguine black and reds."
        
        
        
        When walking up the stairs to the nightmare version of the Grand Cathedral, turn left onto a small platform, then roll off and walk down some rough terrain to find the weapon on a corpse.
        
        
        
        Reminds many of the Zanpakut≈ç , a fictional segmented sword that can function as a whip. It is an iconic weapon from the Bleach anime.
        The untransformed form of the weapon is a cleaver-like serrated club, and it really looks like the samoan war club "Nifo Oti".

        Amygdalan Arm 
        
        
        The arm of a small Amygdala Great One. 
        Strictly speaking, the Amygdalan Arm is no trick weapon of any sort, but certain madmen wield them like clubs. 
        Starts as a large, tough blunt weapon formed of bone, but when extended, the hand quivers as if it were still alive.
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare, cave at the end of the blood river to the right after getting out of the building that used to be the shortcut to the Cleric Beast in the main game. Gatling Gun Hunter dropping the Gatling Gun and a Blood-Starved Beast can be also found here. Arm is near the Blood-Starved Beast at the end of the cave.
        
        
        
        The Amygdalan Arm is a Trick Weapon in name only, considering that it is an arm obtained from Amygdala.
        The arm is remarkably small, as even the Lesser Amygdalae are huge. Perhaps it came from a newborn Amygdala.
        The arm could be the inspiration behind the Burial Blade.

        As flesh is flayed and blood is sprayed, the beast within awakens, and in time, the wielder of this weapon surges with both strength and feverish reverie."
        
        
        
        Ailing Loran Chalice: Layer 2 treasure room. Room is on the right when exiting the elevator from first layer boss fight, before the second layers lantern.
        Can be bought from messengers for 34000 echoes after acquisition.
        Can be bought from messengers after co-operation with player who has them. This only occurs in Hunter's dream before fight with Gehrman or Moon Presence. It is not needed to complete any Chalice Dungeons. It is unknown if this is glitch or intentional. Was patched by 1.07 or 1.08.
        
        
        
        When this weapon is equipped, your gloves will be replaced by two bone gauntlets. This can allow for the lost art of rapid glove changing if you switch your weapons really fast.
        You can charge the beasthood meter on the first windows (Gilbert) of Central Yharnam
        In the past, there was a rare glitch that allowed a player to obtain this weapon without finding it in the Chalice Dungeons.
        It has since been patched, although it isn't quite known when it was successfully patched.

        This thick iron cleaver slices through the toughest of beast hides, and when transformed the blade splits into sections, allowing one to lash it in the fashion of a heavy whip.

        Beasthunter Saif
        
        
        A trick weapon used by the old hunters. 
        A second blade is found inside the curve of the main one. In its initial form, the saif can be wielded like a long curved sword, but when transformed, its blade is contracted, allowing for quick, repeated stabs. 
        Although this trick weapon allows for adaptive combat, it was later replaced by saws and similar weapons that were more effective at disposing of beasts."

        Blade of mercy
        
        
        A special trick weapon passed down among hunters of hunters. One of the oldest weapons of the workshop. 
        Splits into two when activated. The weapon's warped blades are forged with siderite, a rare mineral of the heavens. Most effective swift attacks,such as after a quick-stepping."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers for 40000 echoes after obtaining the Crow Hunter Badge from Eileen the Crow's quest line.
        Killing Eileen is also a way to get the weapon early in the game.
        While progressing through Eileen's quest, it's possible for her to be killed by Henryk and thus drop the Crow Hunter Badge as a result, although the quest line will end.
        
        
        
        The Blade of Mercy was originally named as "Warped Twinblades" during the Alpha test, and it was the tool of choice for the "agile" hunter.
        Both the Burial Blade and Blade of Mercy make mentions of a mineral known as siderite in their descriptions.
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite, and it seems to be the reason why arcane power has direct scaling with both blade's damage output. Due to its extraterrestrial origins, that may explain why it cannot be buffed by an external source of any sort.
        It loosely resembles the Eleum Loyce from Dark Souls 2, a sword with two blades at the front.

        The demented hunter weapon brandished by Brador, the Healing Church assassin. 
        The Bloodletter assumes its true and terrifying form after it draws upon blood from the inner reaches of one's body and soul. 
        This is the only effective means of expelling tainted blood, or so Brador, isolated in his cell, continued to believe."
        
        
        
        Obtain the underground cell inner chamber key.
        Return to the underground prison (from the underground corpse pile lamp, go up the stairs and turn left) and open the door to Brador's cell. His cell is the second on the left behind a flight of downward stairs. Kill Brador to obtain the bloodletter.
        Brador will not be hostile in his cell, but will invade the player right outside his cell.

        Boom Hammer
        
        
        A trick weapon used by the old hunters, and crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. 
        A giant hammer equipped with a miniature furnace. When ignited and fired, it emits a volley of flame that explodes furiously upon impact. 
        Crush the beasts, then burn them - the brute simplicity of the Boom Hammer was favored by hunters with an acute distaste for beasts."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare. Inside a house that looks out of Central Yharnam, the same that is the shortcut to the cleric beast in the main game, where the 10 quicksilver bullets used to be. Be sure to shoot the explosives around the item (or act fast), as the wheelchair huntsman's corpse conceals a delayed molotov set to trigger when you try to grab the Boom Hammer, potential killing you in a huge blast.

        Burial Blade
        
        
        Trick weapon wielded by Gehrman, the first hunter." 
        A masterpiece that defined the entire array of weapons crafted at the workshop. Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens. 
        Gehrman surely saw the hunt as a dirge of farewell, wishing only that his prey might rest in peace, never again to awaken to another harrowing nightmare. "
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 60,000 Blood Echoes after defeating Gehrman, the First Hunter and acquiring the Old Hunter Badge from him.
        To make Gehrman fight you, the "Refuse" option must be selected.
        If one accepts his proposal, the game will outright end there and it will be impossible to obtain this weapon in that playthrough (not including the uncanny/lost forms found in the chalice dungeons).
        Normally, the Burial Blade can only be obtained in NG+ and beyond. However, one can bypass this by using Bold Hunter's Mark, or being killed, during The Moon Presence boss battle.
        
        
        
         The Burial Blade was the first trick weapon ever created, and it inspired others to develop new trick weapons, usually on the premise of adapting to different combat scenerios.
        Not all weapons adapt to different combat scenerios (e.g. Tonitrus), but the Burial Blade still inspired an entire series of weapons that could "transform" to satisfy different purposes.
        It was created, and exclusively wielded, by Gehrman.
        A Burial Blade can be found above the workshop table in the Hunter's Dream.
        The weapon's description mentions that "Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens."
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite. Due to its extraterrestrial nature, it could be the reason why it has direct scaling with arcane and cannot be tampered by external sources.
        Both the Burial Blade and the Blade of Mercy mentions the use of it in their descriptions.
        Interestingly enough, these two weapons also resemble the talons of Mergo's Wet Nurse.
        The shape of the scythe highly resembles Rurufon's scythe from Shadow Tower Abyss, an early title created by From Software as well as being recurring weapons in Souls series.
        A strange bug on rare occurrences the cape on the hunter may come off, usually in a boss fight you could notice if you dodge back and do an R1 combo the cape disappears. [Note, I haven't seen this happen in a while, it's possible that it may have been fixed, but I'll need confirmation on this]

        Chikage
        
        
        Foreign-made weapon wielded by the royal guards who protect Annalise, Queen of the Vilebloods at Cainhurst Castle. 
        When the intricate, rippled engraving that spans the Chikage's blade is imbrued with blood, the sword sings in scarlet hues. 
        However, the rite eats away at the wielder's very essence."
        
        
        
        Join the Cainhurst Vilebloods covenant available at Cainhurst Castle, and then purchase from the Messengers for 50,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Chikage isn't actually a katana - it is a katana/european sword hybrid. Its short crossguard resembles the one of an early viking sword, or the one of a xiphos (greek sword). The closest european crossguard shape with  this sword is the one of a Karabela (a polish sabre). In other hand, the  hilt and pommel resemble the ones of a longsword (a bit longer, to get easier katana traditional jutsu swings), while the blade shape and the 2-handed fighting style is very similar to a katana. A possible explanation for the origin of this hybrid is that the katana's design was imported to Cainhurst, where some modifications were made to create a sword similar to that commonly used by their knights.
        The Chikage is an allusion to a particular 'breed' of Katanas in the Souls games. While it is similar to both the Hiltless and Chaos Blade from Demon's Souls and Dark Souls respectively, the Chikage bears a stronger resemblance to the Magic Sword "Makoto" (also from Demon's Souls). The Makoto is the only one the bunch to actually DRAIN the user's HP over time, rather than decrease it with each successful swing.
        Chikage (ÂçÉÊôØ) literally means "Thousands Views", however if you separated the word into Chi Kage (Ë°ÄÂΩ±), it means "Blood Shadow". This could be correlated to the fact that Shadows Of Yharnam wield a similar katana with a slight  crossguard, however without using the bloodtinge.
        The transforming attack has the hunter sheathe the Chikage before unleashing a strike. This is a reference to Iaijutsu, a traditional Japanese sword technique that focuses on quick-drawing. At its finest, Iaijutse allows the warrior to unsheathe and strike at incredible speeds.
        The name seems to be a tribute to Chikage Yamamura (mentioned as a "special thanks" in credits)
        The name may also be a reference to the work "1000 Plateaus" by Giles Deluze and Felix Guattari, a famous philosophical essay about fluidity and functionality, maybe dirrectly tied to the esoteric nature of the weapons function.

        One of the old trick weapons of the Healing Church, a hunting weapon formed from one of the giant picks that appear in old beast tales. 
        The Church Pick initially serves as a large sword, but when transformed functions as an extended war pick. In spite of its origins, it is a highly practical weapon."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Dropped by a hunter wearing Yahar'Gul set (presumably, this is the summonable Old Hunter Defector Antal) in one of the cells that you open with the Underground Cell Key from the Research Hall. To make this battle simple, attack him through the door with a strong R2 attack, then leave the room. He will lose sight of you and his AI will return to a standstill behind the door. Rinse and repeat until dead.
        
        
        
        The Church Pick And The Hunter's Axe both have similar appearance. When transformed, both are wielded as a polearm and have the same de-transformation attack. The only difference apart from the Church Pick having a slightly more complicated mechanism is that the Hunter's Axe is a strength-based weapon.
        A few of its attacks in the transformed mode are very similar to that of the Burial Blade.

        When blue moonlight dances around the sword, and it channels the abyssal cosmos, its great blade will hurl a shadowy lightwave. 
        The Holy Moonlight Sword is synonymous with Ludwig, the Holy Blade, but few have ever set eyes on the great blade, and whatever guidance it has to offer, it seems to be of a very private, elusive sort."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Found on the Underground Corpse Pile after the fight against Ludwig, The Holy Blade. Ludwig's head will be lying there and you can:
        Kill the head for the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and talk to the head. When prompted, reply "Yes" and you'll get the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and reply "No", then come back later and Simon the Harrowed will be there and give you the sword.
        NOTE: This weapon is missable. If Lawrence is killed before you obtain it, you will no longer be able to talk to the head or obtain it from Simon.
        
        
        
        It seems to be another reappearance of the Moonlight Greatsword, a recurring item found around FromSoftware's games. Notable examples of such games include the first, second and third Dark Souls games, Demon's Souls, King's Field, Ninja Blade, Enchanted Arms, Armored Core, 3D Dot Game Heroes, and Otogi.

        Hunter Axe
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used on the hunt. Retains the qualities of an axe, but offers a wider palette of attacks by transforming. Boasts a heavy blunt attack, leading to high rally potential. No matter their pasts, beasts are no more than beasts. Some choose this axe to play the part of executioner."
        
        
        
        It's possible to pick this trick weapon as a starting weapon near the beginning of Bloodborne.
        If not chosen, it can instead be purchased from the Messengers after the Hunter has found the Saw Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is wielded by Father Gascoigne.
        However, he has a moveset that is different from the Hunter's version.
        He is also capable of using his unique Hunter Pistol even while his Hunter Axe is transformed, which is impossible for the Hunter to do.
        It's also wielded by the Madara's Twin who drops Madara's Whistle when defeated.
        Another hostile hunter NPC wields this trick weapon in the Nightmare Frontier.
        It's been heavily debated by the fanbase whether the transformed mode is a halberd or poleaxe.
        Both forms utilized axe heads with a spear tip at the end (although some poleaxes used hammer heads instead).
        However, neither weapon was known to have extendable handles, which is a special trademark of the Hunter Axe.
        In either case, it's possible this trick weapon was inspired by both weapons and simply incorporated many different designs.
        While wielded in it's transformed mode if the player had a torch equipped in the off-hand beasts afraid of the fire will still recoil in fear of you as if you were brandishing the torch normally (Tested on Beast Patient)

        Kirkhammer
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. On the one side, an easily handled silver sword. On the other, a giant obtuse stone weapon, characterized by a blunt strike and extreme force of impact. The Church takes a heavy-handed, merciless stance toward the plague of beasts, an irony not lost upon the wielders of this most symbolic weapon."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers after acquiring the Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        A miniature of the Kirkhammer was included as the Pre-Order Bonus for Asian editions of Bloodborne. [See the Bundles page for details]
        A "kirk" is an archaic old english word meaning "church."
        This means the weapon is literately known as the Church Hammer.
        The wording also might be a nod to Nordic culture since the word "Kirk" originated from northern England and Old Norse wording.
        The etched wording on the side of the hammer part has similarities to the Old Norse alphabet.
        However, it also has similarities to the Elder Futhark, one of the oldest forms of the runic alphabet system used by Germanic tribes.
        Similar etchings can be found on gravestones all over Yharnam.
        The sword used for this weapon is very similar to the one used for Ludwig's Holy Blade.
        This suggests that the Healing Church used the method of "interchangeable parts" to efficiently mass produce weapons for their hunters.
        However, the sword used for the Kirkhammer is shorter.
        It's wielded by Alfred, should you choose to be friends with him.
        He uses this weapon as a summon.
        However, he wields the Logarius' Wheel if you find him in Cainhurst Castle under special circumstances.
        When untransformed, with the hammer part on the character's back, some cloth parts (capes etc.) of the armor can either get awkwardly stuck on it or cover it.
        Despite being labeled a 'stone weapon', the etchings, wear, and sound produced when it strikes indicate that the hammer is in fact made of metal.

        Kos Parasite
        
        
        When the carcass of Kos washed up on the coast, its insides were teeming with tiny parasites, unlike any found in humans. 
        This atypical weapon can only be clasped tight and swung, but a Kos Parasite is said to stimulate phantasms inhabiting a lumenwood"
        
        
        
        Dropped by Orphan of Kos
        
        
        
        The Kos Parasite is perhaps the most interestingly unique weapon in Bloodborne in various ways: It is one of two weapons that can reach it's full potential while using a rune (the other being Beast Claw), the weapon itself is not held, it is purely an arcane weapon, it is the only weapon directly dropped by defeating a boss, it has the highest durability of any weapon at 600 respectively, it is the only weapon to have an A-scaling of any weapon without any upgrades and is the only weapon to have an S-scaling by upgrading it twice.

        Logarius's Wheel
        
        
        "Weapon wielded by martyr Logarius' band of executioners. 
        Used to slaughter the Vilebloods in Cainhurst. Bathed in pools of their blood, and forever steeped in their ire. 
        Transform to release the power of the wheel and manifest their lingering rage in a show of utter brilliance."
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 13,000 Blood Echoes after acquiring the Wheel Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        Alfred utilizes the Logarius' Wheel when found in Cainhurst Castle.
        This weapon is yet another reference to Berserk, as they are often made in Miyazaki's previous Souls games.
        "Logarius and his band of executioners" bear many similarities to Mozgus, an insanely devout man who traveled the land torturing heretics along with his disciples.
        The wheel in particular was wielded by one of his six disciples, .
        In Dark Souls, Bonewheel Skeletons are another reference to Mozgus' disciples.
        In real life, although wheels weren't typically wielded as weapons, they were commonly used as torture devices, especially during the Middle Ages.
        Torture wheels were nicknamed "breaking wheels," since victims often times would have their limbs broken during the process.
        They were also known as "catherine wheels."
         It's quite possible that Logarius' Wheel also takes some inspiration in its use as a weapon from the English folklore legend of Tom Hickathrift. Tom was a fabled giant killer who made use of a cartwheel to vanquish the Wisbech Giant (also referred to as an ogre).
        Lore theories can be found under "From Berserk to Bloodborne".

        Ludwig's Holy Blade
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. It is said that the silver sword was employed by Ludwig, the first hunter of the church. When transformed, it combines with its sheath to form a greatsword. 
        It exhibits several departures from the workshop's design, suggesting that the Church anticipated much larger inhuman beasts."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased for 20,000 echoes from the Messengers after obtaining the Radiant Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon was wielded by Ludwig, a famous hunter of the Healing Church who designed the blade based on the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        According to the description, Ludwig wielded this sword in combat instead of the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        However, in his boss fight, he wields the Holy Moonlight Sword during a certain part in the fight.
        It is possible that Ludwig wielded the Holy Moonlight Sword and his fellow hunters, inspired by the huge weapon, sought to make replicas. Unable to make a magic sword, a huge metal sheath was the compromise.
        Before the DLC's release, Ludwig's Holy Blade was thought of as From Software's traditional "Moonlight Greatsword" seen throughout various games by the fanbase.
        However, this sword was eventually revealed in the DLC to be a replica of the "true" Moonlight Greatsword in Bloodborne, the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        This isn't the first time Miyazaki used the name of classical music composers in a game.
        A boss from the first "Dark Souls" game, Dragonslayer Ornstein, is named after Leo Ornstein.
        Berlioz from "Armored Core 4" is named after Hector Berlioz.
        The normal form of this weapon is very similar to the sword used for the Kirkhammer.
        However, this sword's normal form has a slightly longer reach when compared to the Kirkhammer's blade.
        The similar nature of these swords suggests that the Healing Church used the method of interchangeable parts to quickly mass produce weapons for their hunters.
        Lore theories exist under Ebrietas Lore.

        Rakuyo
        
        
        Hunter weapon wielded by Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower. 
        A trick sword originated in the same country as the Cainhurst Chikage, only this sword feeds not off blood, but instead demands great dexterity. 
        Lady Maria was fond of this aspect of the Rakuyo, as she frowned upon blood blades, despite being a distant relative of the queen. 
        One day, she abandoned her beloved Rakuyo, casting it into a dark well, when she could stomach it no longer."
        
        
        
        Fishing Hamlet. Get to the bottom of the well. Can be reached from the underground tunnels at the end of the area or via a ladder in the well right away. In that area a Shark Giant will wander around. Fighting him makes a second one appear after the first reaches sufficiently low health. The first giant will walk over near the ladder and scream at the ceiling, causing the second one to drop. The second one drops the weapon.
        Fighting the two of them can be difficult and it is a good idea to use the Shaman Bone Blade to make them fight each other and finish off the weaker one. Molotov cocktails are also very effective against them. If neither is available to you, try to kill the one with the anchor first, as it is significantly harder to dodge.
        One easy way to beat them is use of ranged weapon like Simon's Bowblade if you are a bloodtinge build, and the Holy Moonlight Sword if you are an arcane build.
        A Threaded Cane's transformed whip can easily hit the giants from the ledge once they're lured over and begin attacking, but be sure to keep your distance after each hit. Except that there is no way to lure them over the the ledge. No ranged weapon will hit the one standing at the back and the one hanging from the ceiling doesn't drop down until the first one is at 50% health. 
        Unlike other giants in the game, these ones are easy to gun parry for a visceral attack. Keep in mind this will get very tricky after the other one starts fighting, so try to separate them and time your viscerals to get the invincibility at the right moment.
        If your range is inadequate you can use the monocular to angle a throwing knife to be able to hit the shark giant in the back. This way, you can continue from the strategy of killing them on the ledge with a gun/magic without going around. (confirmed as of January 19th, 2019)
        Chaining together backstabs is a very effecient way of dealing with them, if played right you should be able to eliminate the first shark giant before the second reaches you this way. It is extremely difficult to get behind the patrolling Shark Giant without him detecting you. 
        For a video showing an easy way to kill the sharks with a monocular and a throwing knife strategy, check .
        
        
        
        Rakuyo (ËêΩËëâ) literally means "falling leaf".
        The sword of Rakuyo bears resemblance to the "ky≈´ gunt≈ç", which was a hybrid of the sabre/katana with a handguard, used during the Russo-Japanese War.

        Reiterpallasch
        
        
        Weapon wielded by the Knights of Cainhurst. 
        Combines an elegant knight's sword with the peculiar firearm wielded by the Cainhurst order. 
        The old nobles, long-time imbibers of blood, are no strangers to the sanguine plague, and the disposal of beasts was a discrete task left to their servants, or knights, as they were called for the sake of appearances."
        
        
        
        It's found in a chest located in the entrance hall of Cainhurst Castle, where the Bound Widows are first encountered. When you first enter the room from the main entrance, run towards your two o'clock. The chest will be found in a corner.
        
        
        
        The Reiterpallasch (from German Reiter "horseback rider" and hungarian pallos [Ààp…ílo É] "sword") is a 17th century Hungarian straight sword with a typically double edged blade and guarded hilt that was used by Hungarian noble cavalry and later adapted by most western European armies.
        As pointed out in its description, the rifle spear is made "possibly in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon" (i.e. this one).
        Wynne D. Fanchon from Armored Core: For Answer; another From Software title, pilots a NEXT named Reiterpallasch.

        Rifle Spear
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. A prototype weapon serving as a simple firearm and spear, possibly created in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon. Lacks any notable functions, saving that it is the only trick weapon with an attached gun. "
        
        
        
        It can be found inside a hidden building in Old Yharnam. From the area you fight the first NPC Hunter (who wields a saw spear), drop down where the railing is missing in a corner and land on the ledges below. Go into the building and follow the stairs up; eventually you can find it stashed on a corpse tucked away in a hidden nook as you advance.
        Bought from the messengers for 4000 blood echoes after acquiring the Powder Keg Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        According to the Rifle Spear's description, it was designed as an imitation of "a lost Cainhurst weapon".
        That particular weapon may or may not be the Reiterpallasch.
        It should be noted these two weapons are the only two skill/firearm hybrids whose alternate forms utilize guns.
        The third skill/firearm hybrid weapon in this game is Simon's Bowblade, which transforms from a sword into a bow.
        The Rifle Spear is carried by a Yahar'Gul Hunter in the Cathedral Ward.
        This fight can be tricky because you first encounter a Yahar'Gul Hunter that uses a Tonitrus near the base of the stairs, and if you advance too far towards the houses, the Rifle Spear Yahar'Gul Hunter will join the fight as well.
        He also uses Ludwig's Rifle, meaning he can hit you from a considerable distance with shotgun pellets no matter what mode he uses for the Rifle Spear.

        Saw Cleaver
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used in the hunting business. 
        This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts, transforms into a long cleaver that makes use of centrifugal force. 
        The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness the more grotesquely transformed the beast."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired as a gift from the Messengers the first time you visit the Hunter's Dream.
        If you don't select it, you may buy it after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne.)
        
        
        
        The Saw Cleaver is the Trick Weapon featured on the title screen.
        It was also one of the first weapons to be revealed for this game.
        Overall the mechanisms of this weapon didn't change at all, starting all the way back when Bloodborne was still known as "Project Beast."
        According to the concept art, the Saw Cleaver uses a trigger mechanism to unlock the joint during transformation.
        The design of the Saw Cleaver seems to be inspired by multiple references:
        The transformed cleaver shows a resemblance to LB-66 MOONLIGHT from Armored Core V.
        The Japanese name is written as "nokogiri nata" („Éé„Ç≥„ÇÆ„É™Èâà) or "saw hatchet". Nokogiri is a traditional Japanese saw that cuts from the pull stroke, as opposed to the more common push stroke.
        In real life, there is a type of cleaver known as a mezzaluna ("half moon") cleaver, known for chopping/mincing up various food products.
        Most of these types of cleavers have handles on both ends.
        However, some use a single handle that stretches across the blade, which was used to chop up herbs usually; the saw cleaver follows this particular model.
        Coincidentally, the Strength/Skill/Arcane scaling at maximum level is "CDC" in their respective order.
        The CDC is an American organization designed to combat and prevent "health threats" of varying natures.
        Since the beast scourge acts like a plague (and is spread due to blood-related reasons), those who wield the Saw Cleaver can be thought of as fighting a dangerous epidemic.
        Henryk uses this weapon when he fights you and Eileen the Crow during her questline, as well as when he is summoned by you when using the Old Hunter Bell.
        
        
    

        Beast Cutter
        
        
        A trick weapon used by Old Hunters. 
        This thick iron cleaver slices through the toughest of beast hides, and when transformed the blade splits into sections, allowing one to lash it in the fashion of a heavy whip. 
        This crude weapon relies on brute force and is regrettably inelegant, suggesting that the hunts of the earliest hunters made for horrific affairs, painted in sanguine black and reds."
        
        
        
        When walking up the stairs to the nightmare version of the Grand Cathedral, turn left onto a small platform, then roll off and walk down some rough terrain to find the weapon on a corpse.
        
        
        
        Reminds many of the Zanpakut≈ç , a fictional segmented sword that can function as a whip. It is an iconic weapon from the Bleach anime.
        The untransformed form of the weapon is a cleaver-like serrated club, and it really looks like the samoan war club "Nifo Oti".

        Saw Spear
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used by those who dedicate themselves to the hunt. This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts, transforms into a medium-range spear. The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness the more grotesquely transformed the beast."
        
        
        
        Can be bought from the Bath Messengers, after obtaining the Saw Hunter Badge, for 1,000 Blood Echoes.
        Treasure in Central Yharnam Sewer, on the ledge above the dead end with boats. You also need to cut down the corpse hanging from the rafters high above.

        Simon's Bowblade
        
        
        Choice weapon of Simon, one of the first Healing Church hunters.
        Simon despised firearms, and so the Church workshop had this specially fashioned to his liking. The large curved blade serves as a bow when transformed.
        But aside from a few close friends, Simon was scoffed at for his choice of arms, for who would dare face the beasts with a measly bow?"
        
        
        
        Fishing Hamlet: Found on the body of Simon the Harrowed next to the Lighthouse Hut lantern after answering the first option at the Hunter's Nightmare shortcut and going through his quest-line. Interact with him as he lies on the ground to obtain the weapon.
        You may also kill Simon the Harrowed at The Hunter's Nightmare or Research Hall to obtain the weapon.

        Stake Driver
        
        
        A trick weapon fashioned by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. Favored by the retired hunter Djura. 
        The stake driver, with its queerly complex design, violently drives thick stakes into the flesh of foes. 
        The stake driver allows for high-damage critical attacks, but is difficult to use and leaves its wielder wide open, but none of this should bother a mere Powder Keg."
        
        
        
        Obtain Powder Keg Hunter Badge to unlock for purchase at the Messengers for 8,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Stake Driver is exclusively wielded by Djura when he is still hostile towards you.
        His fight is tricky because the area around him is very limited, meaning you can fall to your death if you're not careful.
        Furthermore, the limited space is perfect for his choice of weapon which has a short range.
        This is modeled after the "Pile Bunker," a type of fictional weaponry which launches piston with gunpowder or explosion.
        In the Japanese version of Bloodborne, this weapon is literally called the Pile Hammer („Éë„Ç§„É´„Éè„É≥„Éû„Éº).
        It bears a striking resemblance to the "Parrying Blade" weapons seen in several "Armored Core" games.
        Has the highest charged attack multiplier out of any other weapon.

        Threaded Cane
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used by hunters on their duties. Sufficiently deadly as a rigid bladed cane, but also serves as a whip when its blade is split into many. Concealing the weapon inside the cane and flogging the beasts with the whip is partly an act of ceremony, an attempt to demonstrate to oneself that the bloodlust of the hunt will never encroach upon the soul."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired at the beginning of the game as a gift from the Messengers.
        If not selected, it is later available for purchase from the blood fountain messengers after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne).
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is used by Iosefka, Last Scholar Yurie and the Frontier Church Hunter.
        Gehrman carries a generic cane in the Workshop instead of the Threaded Cane.
        This trick weapon is possibly inspired by the sword used by Jean-Fran√ßois de Morangias in the climactic battle of French action-horror film Brotherhood of the Wolf (which bears many other similarities to Bloodborne), or the sword used by a bandit leader in the anime/manga series Claymore. Both these weapons act as a straight, double-edged sword that can transform into a segmented, bladed whip.

        Tonitrus
        
        
        "A unique trick weapon contrived by Archibald, the infamous eccentric of the Healing Church workshop. 
        Striking this peculiar iron morning star flail like a match generates the same blue sparks that blanket a darkbeast. 
        Unfortunately, for reasons untold, the hunters of Archibald's time did not fully take to the device."
        
        
        
        Acquire the Spark Hunter Badge by defeating Darkbeast Paarl  to purchase from Messengers.
        Treasure: Yahar'gul, Unseen Village, at the top end of the road. (guarded by 2 Tainted Dogs and a Snatcher during daytime)
        
        
        
        Tonitrus is a Latin word meaning "thunder."
        The in-game description classifies this trick weapon as a morning star flail, but it's actually modeled in the form of a mace.
        The description of Archibald bears many similarities to Nikola Tesla, a famed inventor in real life who specialized in the field of electricity.
        Nikola Tesla created the Tesla Coil, a device that also bears many similarities to the Tonitrus.
        The Tonitrus also bears similarities with the aspergillum, a device used by the Roman Catholic Church to sprinkle holy water.
        According to the description of the Spark Hunter Badge, Archibald was associated with the Healing Church.
        In this sense, it may have been designed under the themes of "purificiation" and "cleansing" that is associated with many Healing Church trick weapons/tools.
        However, due to Archibald's fascination with Dark Beasts, it's more likely he designed the Tonitrus as a measure to replicate the sparks these creatures could unleash.

        Whirligig Saw
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs, and weapon of choice of the Old Hunter Valtr, the Beast Eater. 
        This weapon pummels beasts in its mace form, but its true strength lies in its attached mechanical saws. 
        These discs, lined with serrated teeth,spin rapidly, thrashing the flesh of beasts into fine shreds."
        
        
        
        From the Nightmare Church go down the stairs and follow the path. Drop down into the pools of blood of follow the path further until you reach the Cannon Executioner. Follow the left wall and turn down the path, the weapon is at the end.
        
        
        
        If you use the L2 buzzsaw attack against Orphan of Kos and hold it in place, it attempts to make an immediate counterattack for each time it gets hit by the whirring blades, only to get interrupted by the next hit. It shrieks every time it attacks, so as a result, it lets loose dozens of overlapping shriek sound effects for as long as you hold it in place.
        A whirligig is defined as a toy that is constantly spinning, such as a top or pinwheel, or as something regarded as hectic and constantly changing.
        Similar to most Powder Keg weapons sharing homage to Armored Core weapons, the Whirligig Saw is based on the Grind Blade.
        
    

        Blade of mercy
        
        
        A special trick weapon passed down among hunters of hunters. One of the oldest weapons of the workshop. 
        Splits into two when activated. The weapon's warped blades are forged with siderite, a rare mineral of the heavens. Most effective swift attacks,such as after a quick-stepping."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers for 40000 echoes after obtaining the Crow Hunter Badge from Eileen the Crow's quest line.
        Killing Eileen is also a way to get the weapon early in the game.
        While progressing through Eileen's quest, it's possible for her to be killed by Henryk and thus drop the Crow Hunter Badge as a result, although the quest line will end.
        
        
        
        The Blade of Mercy was originally named as "Warped Twinblades" during the Alpha test, and it was the tool of choice for the "agile" hunter.
        Both the Burial Blade and Blade of Mercy make mentions of a mineral known as siderite in their descriptions.
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite, and it seems to be the reason why arcane power has direct scaling with both blade's damage output. Due to its extraterrestrial origins, that may explain why it cannot be buffed by an external source of any sort.
        It loosely resembles the Eleum Loyce from Dark Souls 2, a sword with two blades at the front.

        Amygdalan Arm 
        
        
        The arm of a small Amygdala Great One. 
        Strictly speaking, the Amygdalan Arm is no trick weapon of any sort, but certain madmen wield them like clubs. 
        Starts as a large, tough blunt weapon formed of bone, but when extended, the hand quivers as if it were still alive.
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare, cave at the end of the blood river to the right after getting out of the building that used to be the shortcut to the Cleric Beast in the main game. Gatling Gun Hunter dropping the Gatling Gun and a Blood-Starved Beast can be also found here. Arm is near the Blood-Starved Beast at the end of the cave.
        
        
        
        The Amygdalan Arm is a Trick Weapon in name only, considering that it is an arm obtained from Amygdala.
        The arm is remarkably small, as even the Lesser Amygdalae are huge. Perhaps it came from a newborn Amygdala.
        The arm could be the inspiration behind the Burial Blade.

        Crafted by chiseling the long bones of an undead darkbeast and fastening them to the weapon. The bones are still alive, and when unleashed, grant its wielder a spurt of beastly power. 
        As flesh is flayed and blood is sprayed, the beast within awakens, and in time, the wielder of this weapon surges with both strength and feverish reverie."

        Can be bought from messengers for 34000 echoes after acquisition.
        Can be bought from messengers after co-operation with player who has them. This only occurs in Hunter's dream before fight with Gehrman or Moon Presence. It is not needed to complete any Chalice Dungeons. It is unknown if this is glitch or intentional. Was patched by 1.07 or 1.08.
        
        
        
        When this weapon is equipped, your gloves will be replaced by two bone gauntlets. This can allow for the lost art of rapid glove changing if you switch your weapons really fast.
        You can charge the beasthood meter on the first windows (Gilbert) of Central Yharnam
        In the past, there was a rare glitch that allowed a player to obtain this weapon without finding it in the Chalice Dungeons.
        It has since been patched, although it isn't quite known when it was successfully patched.

        A second blade is found inside the curve of the main one. In its initial form, the saif can be wielded like a long curved sword, but when transformed, its blade is contracted, allowing for quick, repeated stabs. 
        Although this trick weapon allows for adaptive combat, it was later replaced by saws and similar weapons that were more effective at disposing of beasts."

        A trick weapon used by Old Hunters. 
        This thick iron cleaver slices through the toughest of beast hides, and when transformed the blade splits into sections, allowing one to lash it in the fashion of a heavy whip. 
        This crude weapon relies on brute force and is regrettably inelegant, suggesting that the hunts of the earliest hunters made for horrific affairs, painted in sanguine black and reds."
        
        
        
        When walking up the stairs to the nightmare version of the Grand Cathedral, turn left onto a small platform, then roll off and walk down some rough terrain to find the weapon on a corpse.
        
        
        
        Reminds many of the Zanpakut≈ç , a fictional segmented sword that can function as a whip. It is an iconic weapon from the Bleach anime.
        The untransformed form of the weapon is a cleaver-like serrated club, and it really looks like the samoan war club "Nifo Oti".
        
        
    

        Blade of mercy
        
        
        A special trick weapon passed down among hunters of hunters. One of the oldest weapons of the workshop. 
        Splits into two when activated. The weapon's warped blades are forged with siderite, a rare mineral of the heavens. Most effective swift attacks,such as after a quick-stepping."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers for 40000 echoes after obtaining the Crow Hunter Badge from Eileen the Crow's quest line.
        Killing Eileen is also a way to get the weapon early in the game.
        While progressing through Eileen's quest, it's possible for her to be killed by Henryk and thus drop the Crow Hunter Badge as a result, although the quest line will end.
        
        
        
        The Blade of Mercy was originally named as "Warped Twinblades" during the Alpha test, and it was the tool of choice for the "agile" hunter.
        Both the Burial Blade and Blade of Mercy make mentions of a mineral known as siderite in their descriptions.
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite, and it seems to be the reason why arcane power has direct scaling with both blade's damage output. Due to its extraterrestrial origins, that may explain why it cannot be buffed by an external source of any sort.
        It loosely resembles the Eleum Loyce from Dark Souls 2, a sword with two blades at the front.

        Bloodletter
        
        
        The demented hunter weapon brandished by Brador, the Healing Church assassin. 
        The Bloodletter assumes its true and terrifying form after it draws upon blood from the inner reaches of one's body and soul. 
        This is the only effective means of expelling tainted blood, or so Brador, isolated in his cell, continued to believe."
        
        
        
        Obtain the underground cell inner chamber key.
        Return to the underground prison (from the underground corpse pile lamp, go up the stairs and turn left) and open the door to Brador's cell. His cell is the second on the left behind a flight of downward stairs. Kill Brador to obtain the bloodletter.
        Brador will not be hostile in his cell, but will invade the player right outside his cell.

        Boom Hammer
        
        
        A trick weapon used by the old hunters, and crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. 
        A giant hammer equipped with a miniature furnace. When ignited and fired, it emits a volley of flame that explodes furiously upon impact. 
        Crush the beasts, then burn them - the brute simplicity of the Boom Hammer was favored by hunters with an acute distaste for beasts."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare. Inside a house that looks out of Central Yharnam, the same that is the shortcut to the cleric beast in the main game, where the 10 quicksilver bullets used to be. Be sure to shoot the explosives around the item (or act fast), as the wheelchair huntsman's corpse conceals a delayed molotov set to trigger when you try to grab the Boom Hammer, potential killing you in a huge blast.
        
        
        
        When the Boomhammer is lit, Beast Patient mobs will back away from the player as if they had a torch equipped. (May need to initiate primed attack first)

        Burial Blade
        
        
        Trick weapon wielded by Gehrman, the first hunter." 
        A masterpiece that defined the entire array of weapons crafted at the workshop. Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens. 
        Gehrman surely saw the hunt as a dirge of farewell, wishing only that his prey might rest in peace, never again to awaken to another harrowing nightmare. "
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 60,000 Blood Echoes after defeating Gehrman, the First Hunter and acquiring the Old Hunter Badge from him.
        To make Gehrman fight you, the "Refuse" option must be selected.
        If one accepts his proposal, the game will outright end there and it will be impossible to obtain this weapon in that playthrough (not including the uncanny/lost forms found in the chalice dungeons).
        Normally, the Burial Blade can only be obtained in NG+ and beyond. However, one can bypass this by using Bold Hunter's Mark, or being killed, during The Moon Presence boss battle.
        
        
        
         The Burial Blade was the first trick weapon ever created, and it inspired others to develop new trick weapons, usually on the premise of adapting to different combat scenerios.
        Not all weapons adapt to different combat scenerios (e.g. Tonitrus), but the Burial Blade still inspired an entire series of weapons that could "transform" to satisfy different purposes.
        It was created, and exclusively wielded, by Gehrman.
        A Burial Blade can be found above the workshop table in the Hunter's Dream.
        The weapon's description mentions that "Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens."
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite. Due to its extraterrestrial nature, it could be the reason why it has direct scaling with arcane and cannot be tampered by external sources.
        Both the Burial Blade and the Blade of Mercy mentions the use of it in their descriptions.
        Interestingly enough, these two weapons also resemble the talons of Mergo's Wet Nurse.
        The shape of the scythe highly resembles Rurufon's scythe from Shadow Tower Abyss, an early title created by From Software as well as being recurring weapons in Souls series.
        A strange bug on rare occurrences the cape on the hunter may come off, usually in a boss fight you could notice if you dodge back and do an R1 combo the cape disappears. [Note, I haven't seen this happen in a while, it's possible that it may have been fixed, but I'll need confirmation on this]

        Chikage
        
        
        Foreign-made weapon wielded by the royal guards who protect Annalise, Queen of the Vilebloods at Cainhurst Castle. 
        When the intricate, rippled engraving that spans the Chikage's blade is imbrued with blood, the sword sings in scarlet hues. 
        However, the rite eats away at the wielder's very essence."
        
        
        
        Join the Cainhurst Vilebloods covenant available at Cainhurst Castle, and then purchase from the Messengers for 50,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Chikage isn't actually a katana - it is a katana/european sword hybrid. Its short crossguard resembles the one of an early viking sword, or the one of a xiphos (greek sword). The closest european crossguard shape with  this sword is the one of a Karabela (a polish sabre). In other hand, the  hilt and pommel resemble the ones of a longsword (a bit longer, to get easier katana traditional jutsu swings), while the blade shape and the 2-handed fighting style is very similar to a katana. A possible explanation for the origin of this hybrid is that the katana's design was imported to Cainhurst, where some modifications were made to create a sword similar to that commonly used by their knights.
        The Chikage is an allusion to a particular 'breed' of Katanas in the Souls games. While it is similar to both the Hiltless and Chaos Blade from Demon's Souls and Dark Souls respectively, the Chikage bears a stronger resemblance to the Magic Sword "Makoto" (also from Demon's Souls). The Makoto is the only one the bunch to actually DRAIN the user's HP over time, rather than decrease it with each successful swing.
        Chikage (ÂçÉÊôØ) literally means "Thousands Views", however if you separated the word into Chi Kage (Ë°ÄÂΩ±), it means "Blood Shadow". This could be correlated to the fact that Shadows Of Yharnam wield a similar katana with a slight  crossguard, however without using the bloodtinge.
        The transforming attack has the hunter sheathe the Chikage before unleashing a strike. This is a reference to Iaijutsu, a traditional Japanese sword technique that focuses on quick-drawing. At its finest, Iaijutse allows the warrior to unsheathe and strike at incredible speeds.
        The name seems to be a tribute to Chikage Yamamura (mentioned as a "special thanks" in credits)
        The name may also be a reference to the work "1000 Plateaus" by Giles Deluze and Felix Guattari, a famous philosophical essay about fluidity and functionality, maybe dirrectly tied to the esoteric nature of the weapons function.

        Church Pick
        
        
        One of the old trick weapons of the Healing Church, a hunting weapon formed from one of the giant picks that appear in old beast tales. 
        The Church Pick initially serves as a large sword, but when transformed functions as an extended war pick. In spite of its origins, it is a highly practical weapon."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Dropped by a hunter wearing Yahar'Gul set (presumably, this is the summonable Old Hunter Defector Antal) in one of the cells that you open with the Underground Cell Key from the Research Hall. To make this battle simple, attack him through the door with a strong R2 attack, then leave the room. He will lose sight of you and his AI will return to a standstill behind the door. Rinse and repeat until dead.
        
        
        
        The Church Pick And The Hunter's Axe both have similar appearance. When transformed, both are wielded as a polearm and have the same de-transformation attack. The only difference apart from the Church Pick having a slightly more complicated mechanism is that the Hunter's Axe is a strength-based weapon.
        A few of its attacks in the transformed mode are very similar to that of the Burial Blade.

        Holy Moonlight Sword
        
        
        An arcane sword discovered long ago by Ludwig. 
        When blue moonlight dances around the sword, and it channels the abyssal cosmos, its great blade will hurl a shadowy lightwave. 
        The Holy Moonlight Sword is synonymous with Ludwig, the Holy Blade, but few have ever set eyes on the great blade, and whatever guidance it has to offer, it seems to be of a very private, elusive sort."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Found on the Underground Corpse Pile after the fight against Ludwig, The Holy Blade. Ludwig's head will be lying there and you can:
        Kill the head for the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and talk to the head. When prompted, reply "Yes" and you'll get the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and reply "No", then come back later and Simon the Harrowed will be there and give you the sword.
        NOTE: This weapon is missable. If Lawrence is killed before you obtain it, you will no longer be able to talk to the head or obtain it from Simon.
        
        
        
        It seems to be another reappearance of the Moonlight Greatsword, a recurring item found around FromSoftware's games. Notable examples of such games include the first, second and third Dark Souls games, Demon's Souls, King's Field, Ninja Blade, Enchanted Arms, Armored Core, 3D Dot Game Heroes, and Otogi.

        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used on the hunt. Retains the qualities of an axe, but offers a wider palette of attacks by transforming. Boasts a heavy blunt attack, leading to high rally potential. No matter their pasts, beasts are no more than beasts. Some choose this axe to play the part of executioner."
        
        
        
        It's possible to pick this trick weapon as a starting weapon near the beginning of Bloodborne.
        If not chosen, it can instead be purchased from the Messengers after the Hunter has found the Saw Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is wielded by Father Gascoigne.
        However, he has a moveset that is different from the Hunter's version.
        He is also capable of using his unique Hunter Pistol even while his Hunter Axe is transformed, which is impossible for the Hunter to do.
        It's also wielded by the Madara's Twin who drops Madara's Whistle when defeated.
        Another hostile hunter NPC wields this trick weapon in the Nightmare Frontier.
        It's been heavily debated by the fanbase whether the transformed mode is a halberd or poleaxe.
        Both forms utilized axe heads with a spear tip at the end (although some poleaxes used hammer heads instead).
        However, neither weapon was known to have extendable handles, which is a special trademark of the Hunter Axe.
        In either case, it's possible this trick weapon was inspired by both weapons and simply incorporated many different designs.
        While wielded in it's transformed mode if the player had a torch equipped in the off-hand beasts afraid of the fire will still recoil in fear of you as if you were brandishing the torch normally (Tested on Beast Patient)

        Kirkhammer
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. On the one side, an easily handled silver sword. On the other, a giant obtuse stone weapon, characterized by a blunt strike and extreme force of impact. The Church takes a heavy-handed, merciless stance toward the plague of beasts, an irony not lost upon the wielders of this most symbolic weapon."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers after acquiring the Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        A miniature of the Kirkhammer was included as the Pre-Order Bonus for Asian editions of Bloodborne. [See the Bundles page for details]
        A "kirk" is an archaic old english word meaning "church."
        This means the weapon is literately known as the Church Hammer.
        The wording also might be a nod to Nordic culture since the word "Kirk" originated from northern England and Old Norse wording.
        The etched wording on the side of the hammer part has similarities to the Old Norse alphabet.
        However, it also has similarities to the Elder Futhark, one of the oldest forms of the runic alphabet system used by Germanic tribes.
        Similar etchings can be found on gravestones all over Yharnam.
        The sword used for this weapon is very similar to the one used for Ludwig's Holy Blade.
        This suggests that the Healing Church used the method of "interchangeable parts" to efficiently mass produce weapons for their hunters.
        However, the sword used for the Kirkhammer is shorter.
        It's wielded by Alfred, should you choose to be friends with him.
        He uses this weapon as a summon.
        However, he wields the Logarius' Wheel if you find him in Cainhurst Castle under special circumstances.
        When untransformed, with the hammer part on the character's back, some cloth parts (capes etc.) of the armor can either get awkwardly stuck on it or cover it.
        Despite being labeled a 'stone weapon', the etchings, wear, and sound produced when it strikes indicate that the hammer is in fact made of metal.

        Kos Parasite
        
        
        When the carcass of Kos washed up on the coast, its insides were teeming with tiny parasites, unlike any found in humans. 
        This atypical weapon can only be clasped tight and swung, but a Kos Parasite is said to stimulate phantasms inhabiting a lumenwood"
        
        
        
        Dropped by Orphan of Kos
        
        
        
        The Kos Parasite is perhaps the most interestingly unique weapon in Bloodborne in various ways: It is one of two weapons that can reach it's full potential while using a rune (the other being Beast Claw), the weapon itself is not held, it is purely an arcane weapon, it is the only weapon directly dropped by defeating a boss, it has the highest durability of any weapon at 600 respectively, it is the only weapon to have an A-scaling of any weapon without any upgrades and is the only weapon to have an S-scaling by upgrading it twice.

        Logarius's Wheel
        
        
        "Weapon wielded by martyr Logarius' band of executioners. 
        Used to slaughter the Vilebloods in Cainhurst. Bathed in pools of their blood, and forever steeped in their ire. 
        Transform to release the power of the wheel and manifest their lingering rage in a show of utter brilliance."
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 13,000 Blood Echoes after acquiring the Wheel Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        Alfred utilizes the Logarius' Wheel when found in Cainhurst Castle.
        This weapon is yet another reference to Berserk, as they are often made in Miyazaki's previous Souls games.
        "Logarius and his band of executioners" bear many similarities to Mozgus, an insanely devout man who traveled the land torturing heretics along with his disciples.
        The wheel in particular was wielded by one of his six disciples, .
        In Dark Souls, Bonewheel Skeletons are another reference to Mozgus' disciples.
        In real life, although wheels weren't typically wielded as weapons, they were commonly used as torture devices, especially during the Middle Ages.
        Torture wheels were nicknamed "breaking wheels," since victims often times would have their limbs broken during the process.
        They were also known as "catherine wheels."
         It's quite possible that Logarius' Wheel also takes some inspiration in its use as a weapon from the English folklore legend of Tom Hickathrift. Tom was a fabled giant killer who made use of a cartwheel to vanquish the Wisbech Giant (also referred to as an ogre).
        Lore theories can be found under "From Berserk to Bloodborne".

        Ludwig's Holy Blade
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. It is said that the silver sword was employed by Ludwig, the first hunter of the church. When transformed, it combines with its sheath to form a greatsword. 
        It exhibits several departures from the workshop's design, suggesting that the Church anticipated much larger inhuman beasts."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased for 20,000 echoes from the Messengers after obtaining the Radiant Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon was wielded by Ludwig, a famous hunter of the Healing Church who designed the blade based on the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        According to the description, Ludwig wielded this sword in combat instead of the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        However, in his boss fight, he wields the Holy Moonlight Sword during a certain part in the fight.
        It is possible that Ludwig wielded the Holy Moonlight Sword and his fellow hunters, inspired by the huge weapon, sought to make replicas. Unable to make a magic sword, a huge metal sheath was the compromise.
        Before the DLC's release, Ludwig's Holy Blade was thought of as From Software's traditional "Moonlight Greatsword" seen throughout various games by the fanbase.
        However, this sword was eventually revealed in the DLC to be a replica of the "true" Moonlight Greatsword in Bloodborne, the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        This isn't the first time Miyazaki used the name of classical music composers in a game.
        A boss from the first "Dark Souls" game, Dragonslayer Ornstein, is named after Leo Ornstein.
        Berlioz from "Armored Core 4" is named after Hector Berlioz.
        The normal form of this weapon is very similar to the sword used for the Kirkhammer.
        However, this sword's normal form has a slightly longer reach when compared to the Kirkhammer's blade.
        The similar nature of these swords suggests that the Healing Church used the method of interchangeable parts to quickly mass produce weapons for their hunters.
        Lore theories exist under Ebrietas Lore.

        Rakuyo
        
        
        Hunter weapon wielded by Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower. 
        A trick sword originated in the same country as the Cainhurst Chikage, only this sword feeds not off blood, but instead demands great dexterity. 
        Lady Maria was fond of this aspect of the Rakuyo, as she frowned upon blood blades, despite being a distant relative of the queen. 
        One day, she abandoned her beloved Rakuyo, casting it into a dark well, when she could stomach it no longer."
        
        
        
        Fishing Hamlet. Get to the bottom of the well. Can be reached from the underground tunnels at the end of the area or via a ladder in the well right away. In that area a Shark Giant will wander around. Fighting him makes a second one appear after the first reaches sufficiently low health. The first giant will walk over near the ladder and scream at the ceiling, causing the second one to drop. The second one drops the weapon.
        Fighting the two of them can be difficult and it is a good idea to use the Shaman Bone Blade to make them fight each other and finish off the weaker one. Molotov cocktails are also very effective against them. If neither is available to you, try to kill the one with the anchor first, as it is significantly harder to dodge.
        One easy way to beat them is use of ranged weapon like Simon's Bowblade if you are a bloodtinge build, and the Holy Moonlight Sword if you are an arcane build.
        A Threaded Cane's transformed whip can easily hit the giants from the ledge once they're lured over and begin attacking, but be sure to keep your distance after each hit. Except that there is no way to lure them over the the ledge. No ranged weapon will hit the one standing at the back and the one hanging from the ceiling doesn't drop down until the first one is at 50% health. 
        Unlike other giants in the game, these ones are easy to gun parry for a visceral attack. Keep in mind this will get very tricky after the other one starts fighting, so try to separate them and time your viscerals to get the invincibility at the right moment.
        If your range is inadequate you can use the monocular to angle a throwing knife to be able to hit the shark giant in the back. This way, you can continue from the strategy of killing them on the ledge with a gun/magic without going around. (confirmed as of January 19th, 2019)
        Chaining together backstabs is a very effecient way of dealing with them, if played right you should be able to eliminate the first shark giant before the second reaches you this way. It is extremely difficult to get behind the patrolling Shark Giant without him detecting you. 
        For a video showing an easy way to kill the sharks with a monocular and a throwing knife strategy, check .
        
        
        
        Rakuyo (ËêΩËëâ) literally means "falling leaf".
        The sword of Rakuyo bears resemblance to the "ky≈´ gunt≈ç", which was a hybrid of the sabre/katana with a handguard, used during the Russo-Japanese War.

        Reiterpallasch
        
        
        Weapon wielded by the Knights of Cainhurst. 
        Combines an elegant knight's sword with the peculiar firearm wielded by the Cainhurst order. 
        The old nobles, long-time imbibers of blood, are no strangers to the sanguine plague, and the disposal of beasts was a discrete task left to their servants, or knights, as they were called for the sake of appearances."
        
        
        
        It's found in a chest located in the entrance hall of Cainhurst Castle, where the Bound Widows are first encountered. When you first enter the room from the main entrance, run towards your two o'clock. The chest will be found in a corner.
        
        
        
        The Reiterpallasch (from German Reiter "horseback rider" and hungarian pallos [Ààp…ílo É] "sword") is a 17th century Hungarian straight sword with a typically double edged blade and guarded hilt that was used by Hungarian noble cavalry and later adapted by most western European armies.
        As pointed out in its description, the rifle spear is made "possibly in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon" (i.e. this one).
        Wynne D. Fanchon from Armored Core: For Answer; another From Software title, pilots a NEXT named Reiterpallasch.

        Rifle Spear
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. A prototype weapon serving as a simple firearm and spear, possibly created in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon. Lacks any notable functions, saving that it is the only trick weapon with an attached gun. "
        
        
        
        It can be found inside a hidden building in Old Yharnam. From the area you fight the first NPC Hunter (who wields a saw spear), drop down where the railing is missing in a corner and land on the ledges below. Go into the building and follow the stairs up; eventually you can find it stashed on a corpse tucked away in a hidden nook as you advance.
        Bought from the messengers for 4000 blood echoes after acquiring the Powder Keg Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        According to the Rifle Spear's description, it was designed as an imitation of "a lost Cainhurst weapon".
        That particular weapon may or may not be the Reiterpallasch.
        It should be noted these two weapons are the only two skill/firearm hybrids whose alternate forms utilize guns.
        The third skill/firearm hybrid weapon in this game is Simon's Bowblade, which transforms from a sword into a bow.
        The Rifle Spear is carried by a Yahar'Gul Hunter in the Cathedral Ward.
        This fight can be tricky because you first encounter a Yahar'Gul Hunter that uses a Tonitrus near the base of the stairs, and if you advance too far towards the houses, the Rifle Spear Yahar'Gul Hunter will join the fight as well.
        He also uses Ludwig's Rifle, meaning he can hit you from a considerable distance with shotgun pellets no matter what mode he uses for the Rifle Spear.

        This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts, transforms into a long cleaver that makes use of centrifugal force. 
        The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness the more grotesquely transformed the beast."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired as a gift from the Messengers the first time you visit the Hunter's Dream.
        If you don't select it, you may buy it after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne.)
        
        
        
        The Saw Cleaver is the Trick Weapon featured on the title screen.
        It was also one of the first weapons to be revealed for this game.
        Overall the mechanisms of this weapon didn't change at all, starting all the way back when Bloodborne was still known as "Project Beast."
        According to the concept art, the Saw Cleaver uses a trigger mechanism to unlock the joint during transformation.
        The design of the Saw Cleaver seems to be inspired by multiple references:
        The transformed cleaver shows a resemblance to LB-66 MOONLIGHT from Armored Core V.
        The Japanese name is written as "nokogiri nata" („Éé„Ç≥„ÇÆ„É™Èâà) or "saw hatchet". Nokogiri is a traditional Japanese saw that cuts from the pull stroke, as opposed to the more common push stroke.
        In real life, there is a type of cleaver known as a mezzaluna ("half moon") cleaver, known for chopping/mincing up various food products.
        Most of these types of cleavers have handles on both ends.
        However, some use a single handle that stretches across the blade, which was used to chop up herbs usually; the saw cleaver follows this particular model.
        Coincidentally, the Strength/Skill/Arcane scaling at maximum level is "CDC" in their respective order.
        The CDC is an American organization designed to combat and prevent "health threats" of varying natures.
        Since the beast scourge acts like a plague (and is spread due to blood-related reasons), those who wield the Saw Cleaver can be thought of as fighting a dangerous epidemic.
        Henryk uses this weapon when he fights you and Eileen the Crow during her questline, as well as when he is summoned by you when using the Old Hunter Bell.
        
        
    

        Blade of mercy
        
        
        A special trick weapon passed down among hunters of hunters. One of the oldest weapons of the workshop. 
        Splits into two when activated. The weapon's warped blades are forged with siderite, a rare mineral of the heavens. Most effective swift attacks,such as after a quick-stepping."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers for 40000 echoes after obtaining the Crow Hunter Badge from Eileen the Crow's quest line.
        Killing Eileen is also a way to get the weapon early in the game.
        While progressing through Eileen's quest, it's possible for her to be killed by Henryk and thus drop the Crow Hunter Badge as a result, although the quest line will end.
        
        
        
        The Blade of Mercy was originally named as "Warped Twinblades" during the Alpha test, and it was the tool of choice for the "agile" hunter.
        Both the Burial Blade and Blade of Mercy make mentions of a mineral known as siderite in their descriptions.
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite, and it seems to be the reason why arcane power has direct scaling with both blade's damage output. Due to its extraterrestrial origins, that may explain why it cannot be buffed by an external source of any sort.
        It loosely resembles the Eleum Loyce from Dark Souls 2, a sword with two blades at the front.

        Saw Spear
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used by those who dedicate themselves to the hunt. This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts, transforms into a medium-range spear. The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness the more grotesquely transformed the beast."
        
        
        
        Can be bought from the Bath Messengers, after obtaining the Saw Hunter Badge, for 1,000 Blood Echoes.
        Treasure in Central Yharnam Sewer, on the ledge above the dead end with boats. You also need to cut down the corpse hanging from the rafters high above.
        
        
        
        Carried by Djura's Ally in Old Yharnam.

        Simon's Bowblade
        
        
        Choice weapon of Simon, one of the first Healing Church hunters.
        Simon despised firearms, and so the Church workshop had this specially fashioned to his liking. The large curved blade serves as a bow when transformed.
        But aside from a few close friends, Simon was scoffed at for his choice of arms, for who would dare face the beasts with a measly bow?"
        
        
        
        Fishing Hamlet: Found on the body of Simon the Harrowed next to the Lighthouse Hut lantern after answering the first option at the Hunter's Nightmare shortcut and going through his quest-line. Interact with him as he lies on the ground to obtain the weapon.
        You may also kill Simon the Harrowed at The Hunter's Nightmare or Research Hall to obtain the weapon.
        
        
        
        Simon's Bowblade is the only weapon to have a S-scaling for two attributes (Skill and Bloodtinge respectively) when fully upgraded

        Stake Driver
        
        
        A trick weapon fashioned by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. Favored by the retired hunter Djura. 
        The stake driver, with its queerly complex design, violently drives thick stakes into the flesh of foes. 
        The stake driver allows for high-damage critical attacks, but is difficult to use and leaves its wielder wide open, but none of this should bother a mere Powder Keg."
        
        
        
        Obtain Powder Keg Hunter Badge to unlock for purchase at the Messengers for 8,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Stake Driver is exclusively wielded by Djura when he is still hostile towards you.
        His fight is tricky because the area around him is very limited, meaning you can fall to your death if you're not careful.
        Furthermore, the limited space is perfect for his choice of weapon which has a short range.
        This is modeled after the "Pile Bunker," a type of fictional weaponry which launches piston with gunpowder or explosion.
        In the Japanese version of Bloodborne, this weapon is literally called the Pile Hammer („Éë„Ç§„É´„Éè„É≥„Éû„Éº).
        It bears a striking resemblance to the "Parrying Blade" weapons seen in several "Armored Core" games.
        Has the highest charged attack multiplier out of any other weapon.

        Threaded Cane
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used by hunters on their duties. Sufficiently deadly as a rigid bladed cane, but also serves as a whip when its blade is split into many. Concealing the weapon inside the cane and flogging the beasts with the whip is partly an act of ceremony, an attempt to demonstrate to oneself that the bloodlust of the hunt will never encroach upon the soul."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired at the beginning of the game as a gift from the Messengers.
        If not selected, it is later available for purchase from the blood fountain messengers after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne).
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is used by Iosefka, Last Scholar Yurie and the Frontier Church Hunter.
        Gehrman carries a generic cane in the Workshop instead of the Threaded Cane.
        This trick weapon is possibly inspired by the sword used by Jean-Fran√ßois de Morangias in the climactic battle of French action-horror film Brotherhood of the Wolf (which bears many other similarities to Bloodborne), or the sword used by a bandit leader in the anime/manga series Claymore. Both these weapons act as a straight, double-edged sword that can transform into a segmented, bladed whip.

        Tonitrus
        
        
        "A unique trick weapon contrived by Archibald, the infamous eccentric of the Healing Church workshop. 
        Striking this peculiar iron morning star flail like a match generates the same blue sparks that blanket a darkbeast. 
        Unfortunately, for reasons untold, the hunters of Archibald's time did not fully take to the device."
        
        
        
        Acquire the Spark Hunter Badge by defeating Darkbeast Paarl  to purchase from Messengers.
        Treasure: Yahar'gul, Unseen Village, at the top end of the road. (guarded by 2 Tainted Dogs and a Snatcher during daytime)
        
        
        
        Tonitrus is a Latin word meaning "thunder."
        The in-game description classifies this trick weapon as a morning star flail, but it's actually modeled in the form of a mace.
        The description of Archibald bears many similarities to Nikola Tesla, a famed inventor in real life who specialized in the field of electricity.
        Nikola Tesla created the Tesla Coil, a device that also bears many similarities to the Tonitrus.
        The Tonitrus also bears similarities with the aspergillum, a device used by the Roman Catholic Church to sprinkle holy water.
        According to the description of the Spark Hunter Badge, Archibald was associated with the Healing Church.
        In this sense, it may have been designed under the themes of "purificiation" and "cleansing" that is associated with many Healing Church trick weapons/tools.
        However, due to Archibald's fascination with Dark Beasts, it's more likely he designed the Tonitrus as a measure to replicate the sparks these creatures could unleash.

        Whirligig Saw
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs, and weapon of choice of the Old Hunter Valtr, the Beast Eater. 
        This weapon pummels beasts in its mace form, but its true strength lies in its attached mechanical saws. 
        These discs, lined with serrated teeth,spin rapidly, thrashing the flesh of beasts into fine shreds."
        
        
        
        From the Nightmare Church go down the stairs and follow the path. Drop down into the pools of blood of follow the path further until you reach the Cannon Executioner. Follow the left wall and turn down the path, the weapon is at the end.
        
        
        
        If you use the L2 buzzsaw attack against Orphan of Kos and hold it in place, it attempts to make an immediate counterattack for each time it gets hit by the whirring blades, only to get interrupted by the next hit. It shrieks every time it attacks, so as a result, it lets loose dozens of overlapping shriek sound effects for as long as you hold it in place.
        A whirligig is defined as a toy that is constantly spinning, such as a top or pinwheel, or as something regarded as hectic and constantly changing.
        Similar to most Powder Keg weapons sharing homage to Armored Core weapons, the Whirligig Saw is based on the Grind Blade.
        
    

        Bloodletter
        
        
        The demented hunter weapon brandished by Brador, the Healing Church assassin. 
        The Bloodletter assumes its true and terrifying form after it draws upon blood from the inner reaches of one's body and soul. 
        This is the only effective means of expelling tainted blood, or so Brador, isolated in his cell, continued to believe."
        
        
        
        Obtain the underground cell inner chamber key.
        Return to the underground prison (from the underground corpse pile lamp, go up the stairs and turn left) and open the door to Brador's cell. His cell is the second on the left behind a flight of downward stairs. Kill Brador to obtain the bloodletter.
        Brador will not be hostile in his cell, but will invade the player right outside his cell.

        Amygdalan Arm 
        
        
        The arm of a small Amygdala Great One. 
        Strictly speaking, the Amygdalan Arm is no trick weapon of any sort, but certain madmen wield them like clubs. 
        Starts as a large, tough blunt weapon formed of bone, but when extended, the hand quivers as if it were still alive.
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare, cave at the end of the blood river to the right after getting out of the building that used to be the shortcut to the Cleric Beast in the main game. Gatling Gun Hunter dropping the Gatling Gun and a Blood-Starved Beast can be also found here. Arm is near the Blood-Starved Beast at the end of the cave.
        
        
        
        The Amygdalan Arm is a Trick Weapon in name only, considering that it is an arm obtained from Amygdala.
        The arm is remarkably small, as even the Lesser Amygdalae are huge. Perhaps it came from a newborn Amygdala.
        The arm could be the inspiration behind the Burial Blade.

        Beastly weapon wielded by Irreverent Izzy.
        Crafted by chiseling the long bones of an undead darkbeast and fastening them to the weapon. The bones are still alive, and when unleashed, grant its wielder a spurt of beastly power. 
        As flesh is flayed and blood is sprayed, the beast within awakens, and in time, the wielder of this weapon surges with both strength and feverish reverie."

        Can be bought from messengers for 34000 echoes after acquisition.
        Can be bought from messengers after co-operation with player who has them. This only occurs in Hunter's dream before fight with Gehrman or Moon Presence. It is not needed to complete any Chalice Dungeons. It is unknown if this is glitch or intentional. Was patched by 1.07 or 1.08.
        
        
        
        When this weapon is equipped, your gloves will be replaced by two bone gauntlets. This can allow for the lost art of rapid glove changing if you switch your weapons really fast.
        You can charge the beasthood meter on the first windows (Gilbert) of Central Yharnam
        In the past, there was a rare glitch that allowed a player to obtain this weapon without finding it in the Chalice Dungeons.

        Beasthunter Saif
        
        
        A trick weapon used by the old hunters. 
        A second blade is found inside the curve of the main one. In its initial form, the saif can be wielded like a long curved sword, but when transformed, its blade is contracted, allowing for quick, repeated stabs. 
        Although this trick weapon allows for adaptive combat, it was later replaced by saws and similar weapons that were more effective at disposing of beasts."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare. After the Blood River, when you pass through the cave with a tick, where you encounter two dogs and a large amount of crows along with an enemy Beast Cutter hunter. Climb the ladder on the left of the pit and instead of going forward, turn to the left and drop down the ledge. There will be a single piece of loot guarded by a Saif Hunter.
        
        
        
        The word "saif" is Arabic for "sword."

        Brador will not be hostile in his cell, but will invade the player right outside his cell.

        Beast Cutter
        
        
        A trick weapon used by Old Hunters. 
        This thick iron cleaver slices through the toughest of beast hides, and when transformed the blade splits into sections, allowing one to lash it in the fashion of a heavy whip. 
        This crude weapon relies on brute force and is regrettably inelegant, suggesting that the hunts of the earliest hunters made for horrific affairs, painted in sanguine black and reds."
        
        
        
        When walking up the stairs to the nightmare version of the Grand Cathedral, turn left onto a small platform, then roll off and walk down some rough terrain to find the weapon on a corpse.
        
        
        
        Reminds many of the Zanpakut≈ç , a fictional segmented sword that can function as a whip. It is an iconic weapon from the Bleach anime.
        The untransformed form of the weapon is a cleaver-like serrated club, and it really looks like the samoan war club "Nifo Oti".

        Blade of mercy
        
        
        A special trick weapon passed down among hunters of hunters. One of the oldest weapons of the workshop. 
        Splits into two when activated. The weapon's warped blades are forged with siderite, a rare mineral of the heavens. Most effective swift attacks,such as after a quick-stepping."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers for 40000 echoes after obtaining the Crow Hunter Badge from Eileen the Crow's quest line.
        Killing Eileen is also a way to get the weapon early in the game.
        While progressing through Eileen's quest, it's possible for her to be killed by Henryk and thus drop the Crow Hunter Badge as a result, although the quest line will end.
        
        
        
        The Blade of Mercy was originally named as "Warped Twinblades" during the Alpha test, and it was the tool of choice for the "agile" hunter.
        Both the Burial Blade and Blade of Mercy make mentions of a mineral known as siderite in their descriptions.
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite, and it seems to be the reason why arcane power has direct scaling with both blade's damage output. Due to its extraterrestrial origins, that may explain why it cannot be buffed by an external source of any sort.
        It loosely resembles the Eleum Loyce from Dark Souls 2, a sword with two blades at the front.

        Boom Hammer
        
        
        A trick weapon used by the old hunters, and crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. 
        A giant hammer equipped with a miniature furnace. When ignited and fired, it emits a volley of flame that explodes furiously upon impact. 
        Crush the beasts, then burn them - the brute simplicity of the Boom Hammer was favored by hunters with an acute distaste for beasts."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare. Inside a house that looks out of Central Yharnam, the same that is the shortcut to the cleric beast in the main game, where the 10 quicksilver bullets used to be. Be sure to shoot the explosives around the item (or act fast), as the wheelchair huntsman's corpse conceals a delayed molotov set to trigger when you try to grab the Boom Hammer, potential killing you in a huge blast.
        
        
        
        When the Boomhammer is lit, Beast Patient mobs will back away from the player as if they had a torch equipped. (May need to initiate primed attack first)

        Burial Blade
        
        
        Trick weapon wielded by Gehrman, the first hunter." 
        A masterpiece that defined the entire array of weapons crafted at the workshop. Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens. 
        Gehrman surely saw the hunt as a dirge of farewell, wishing only that his prey might rest in peace, never again to awaken to another harrowing nightmare. "
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 60,000 Blood Echoes after defeating Gehrman, the First Hunter and acquiring the Old Hunter Badge from him.
        To make Gehrman fight you, the "Refuse" option must be selected.
        If one accepts his proposal, the game will outright end there and it will be impossible to obtain this weapon in that playthrough (not including the uncanny/lost forms found in the chalice dungeons).
        Normally, the Burial Blade can only be obtained in NG+ and beyond. However, one can bypass this by using Bold Hunter's Mark, or being killed, during The Moon Presence boss battle.
        
        
        
         The Burial Blade was the first trick weapon ever created, and it inspired others to develop new trick weapons, usually on the premise of adapting to different combat scenerios.
        Not all weapons adapt to different combat scenerios (e.g. Tonitrus), but the Burial Blade still inspired an entire series of weapons that could "transform" to satisfy different purposes.
        It was created, and exclusively wielded, by Gehrman.
        A Burial Blade can be found above the workshop table in the Hunter's Dream.
        The weapon's description mentions that "Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens."
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite. Due to its extraterrestrial nature, it could be the reason why it has direct scaling with arcane and cannot be tampered by external sources.
        Both the Burial Blade and the Blade of Mercy mentions the use of it in their descriptions.
        Interestingly enough, these two weapons also resemble the talons of Mergo's Wet Nurse.
        The shape of the scythe highly resembles Rurufon's scythe from Shadow Tower Abyss, an early title created by From Software as well as being recurring weapons in Souls series.
        A strange bug on rare occurrences the cape on the hunter may come off, usually in a boss fight you could notice if you dodge back and do an R1 combo the cape disappears. [Note, I haven't seen this happen in a while, it's possible that it may have been fixed, but I'll need confirmation on this]

        Chikage
        
        
        Foreign-made weapon wielded by the royal guards who protect Annalise, Queen of the Vilebloods at Cainhurst Castle. 
        When the intricate, rippled engraving that spans the Chikage's blade is imbrued with blood, the sword sings in scarlet hues. 
        However, the rite eats away at the wielder's very essence."
        
        
        
        Join the Cainhurst Vilebloods covenant available at Cainhurst Castle, and then purchase from the Messengers for 50,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Chikage isn't actually a katana - it is a katana/european sword hybrid. Its short crossguard resembles the one of an early viking sword, or the one of a xiphos (greek sword). The closest european crossguard shape with  this sword is the one of a Karabela (a polish sabre). In other hand, the  hilt and pommel resemble the ones of a longsword (a bit longer, to get easier katana traditional jutsu swings), while the blade shape and the 2-handed fighting style is very similar to a katana. A possible explanation for the origin of this hybrid is that the katana's design was imported to Cainhurst, where some modifications were made to create a sword similar to that commonly used by their knights.
        The Chikage is an allusion to a particular 'breed' of Katanas in the Souls games. While it is similar to both the Hiltless and Chaos Blade from Demon's Souls and Dark Souls respectively, the Chikage bears a stronger resemblance to the Magic Sword "Makoto" (also from Demon's Souls). The Makoto is the only one the bunch to actually DRAIN the user's HP over time, rather than decrease it with each successful swing.
        Chikage (ÂçÉÊôØ) literally means "Thousands Views", however if you separated the word into Chi Kage (Ë°ÄÂΩ±), it means "Blood Shadow". This could be correlated to the fact that Shadows Of Yharnam wield a similar katana with a slight  crossguard, however without using the bloodtinge.
        The transforming attack has the hunter sheathe the Chikage before unleashing a strike. This is a reference to Iaijutsu, a traditional Japanese sword technique that focuses on quick-drawing. At its finest, Iaijutse allows the warrior to unsheathe and strike at incredible speeds.
        The name seems to be a tribute to Chikage Yamamura (mentioned as a "special thanks" in credits)
        The name may also be a reference to the work "1000 Plateaus" by Giles Deluze and Felix Guattari, a famous philosophical essay about fluidity and functionality, maybe dirrectly tied to the esoteric nature of the weapons function.

        Church Pick
        
        
        One of the old trick weapons of the Healing Church, a hunting weapon formed from one of the giant picks that appear in old beast tales. 
        The Church Pick initially serves as a large sword, but when transformed functions as an extended war pick. In spite of its origins, it is a highly practical weapon."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Dropped by a hunter wearing Yahar'Gul set (presumably, this is the summonable Old Hunter Defector Antal) in one of the cells that you open with the Underground Cell Key from the Research Hall. To make this battle simple, attack him through the door with a strong R2 attack, then leave the room. He will lose sight of you and his AI will return to a standstill behind the door. Rinse and repeat until dead.
        
        
        
        The Church Pick And The Hunter's Axe both have similar appearance. When transformed, both are wielded as a polearm and have the same de-transformation attack. The only difference apart from the Church Pick having a slightly more complicated mechanism is that the Hunter's Axe is a strength-based weapon.
        A few of its attacks in the transformed mode are very similar to that of the Burial Blade.

        Holy Moonlight Sword
        
        
        An arcane sword discovered long ago by Ludwig. 
        When blue moonlight dances around the sword, and it channels the abyssal cosmos, its great blade will hurl a shadowy lightwave. 
        The Holy Moonlight Sword is synonymous with Ludwig, the Holy Blade, but few have ever set eyes on the great blade, and whatever guidance it has to offer, it seems to be of a very private, elusive sort."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Found on the Underground Corpse Pile after the fight against Ludwig, The Holy Blade. Ludwig's head will be lying there and you can:
        Kill the head for the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and talk to the head. When prompted, reply "Yes" and you'll get the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and reply "No", then come back later and Simon the Harrowed will be there and give you the sword.
        NOTE: This weapon is missable. If Lawrence is killed before you obtain it, you will no longer be able to talk to the head or obtain it from Simon.
        
        
        
        It seems to be another reappearance of the Moonlight Greatsword, a recurring item found around FromSoftware's games. Notable examples of such games include the first, second and third Dark Souls games, Demon's Souls, King's Field, Ninja Blade, Enchanted Arms, Armored Core, 3D Dot Game Heroes, and Otogi.

        Hunter Axe
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used on the hunt. Retains the qualities of an axe, but offers a wider palette of attacks by transforming. Boasts a heavy blunt attack, leading to high rally potential. No matter their pasts, beasts are no more than beasts. Some choose this axe to play the part of executioner."
        
        
        
        It's possible to pick this trick weapon as a starting weapon near the beginning of Bloodborne.
        If not chosen, it can instead be purchased from the Messengers after the Hunter has found the Saw Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is wielded by Father Gascoigne.
        However, he has a moveset that is different from the Hunter's version.
        He is also capable of using his unique Hunter Pistol even while his Hunter Axe is transformed, which is impossible for the Hunter to do.
        It's also wielded by the Madara's Twin who drops Madara's Whistle when defeated.
        Another hostile hunter NPC wields this trick weapon in the Nightmare Frontier.
        It's been heavily debated by the fanbase whether the transformed mode is a halberd or poleaxe.
        Both forms utilized axe heads with a spear tip at the end (although some poleaxes used hammer heads instead).
        However, neither weapon was known to have extendable handles, which is a special trademark of the Hunter Axe.
        In either case, it's possible this trick weapon was inspired by both weapons and simply incorporated many different designs.
        While wielded in it's transformed mode if the player had a torch equipped in the off-hand beasts afraid of the fire will still recoil in fear of you as if you were brandishing the torch normally (Tested on Beast Patient)

        The Bloodletter assumes its true and terrifying form after it draws upon blood from the inner reaches of one's body and soul. 
        This is the only effective means of expelling tainted blood, or so Brador, isolated in his cell, continued to believe."

        Return to the underground prison (from the underground corpse pile lamp, go up the stairs and turn left) and open the door to Brador's cell. His cell is the second on the left behind a flight of downward stairs. Kill Brador to obtain the bloodletter.
        Brador will not be hostile in his cell, but will invade the player right outside his cell.

        Kirkhammer
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. On the one side, an easily handled silver sword. On the other, a giant obtuse stone weapon, characterized by a blunt strike and extreme force of impact. The Church takes a heavy-handed, merciless stance toward the plague of beasts, an irony not lost upon the wielders of this most symbolic weapon."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers after acquiring the Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        A miniature of the Kirkhammer was included as the Pre-Order Bonus for Asian editions of Bloodborne. [See the Bundles page for details]
        A "kirk" is an archaic old english word meaning "church."
        This means the weapon is literately known as the Church Hammer.
        The wording also might be a nod to Nordic culture since the word "Kirk" originated from northern England and Old Norse wording.
        The etched wording on the side of the hammer part has similarities to the Old Norse alphabet.
        However, it also has similarities to the Elder Futhark, one of the oldest forms of the runic alphabet system used by Germanic tribes.
        Similar etchings can be found on gravestones all over Yharnam.
        The sword used for this weapon is very similar to the one used for Ludwig's Holy Blade.
        This suggests that the Healing Church used the method of "interchangeable parts" to efficiently mass produce weapons for their hunters.
        However, the sword used for the Kirkhammer is shorter.
        It's wielded by Alfred, should you choose to be friends with him.
        He uses this weapon as a summon.
        However, he wields the Logarius' Wheel if you find him in Cainhurst Castle under special circumstances.
        When untransformed, with the hammer part on the character's back, some cloth parts (capes etc.) of the armor can either get awkwardly stuck on it or cover it.
        Despite being labeled a 'stone weapon', the etchings, wear, and sound produced when it strikes indicate that the hammer is in fact made of metal.
        
        
    

        Bloodletter

        Kos Parasite
        
        
        When the carcass of Kos washed up on the coast, its insides were teeming with tiny parasites, unlike any found in humans. 
        This atypical weapon can only be clasped tight and swung, but a Kos Parasite is said to stimulate phantasms inhabiting a lumenwood"
        
        
        
        Dropped by Orphan of Kos
        
        
        
        The Kos Parasite is perhaps the most interestingly unique weapon in Bloodborne in various ways: It is one of two weapons that can reach it's full potential while using a rune (the other being Beast Claw), the weapon itself is not held, it is purely an arcane weapon, it is the only weapon directly dropped by defeating a boss, it has the highest durability of any weapon at 600 respectively, it is the only weapon to have an A-scaling of any weapon without any upgrades and is the only weapon to have an S-scaling by upgrading it twice.

        Logarius's Wheel
        
        
        "Weapon wielded by martyr Logarius' band of executioners. 
        Used to slaughter the Vilebloods in Cainhurst. Bathed in pools of their blood, and forever steeped in their ire. 
        Transform to release the power of the wheel and manifest their lingering rage in a show of utter brilliance."
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 13,000 Blood Echoes after acquiring the Wheel Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        Alfred utilizes the Logarius' Wheel when found in Cainhurst Castle.
        This weapon is yet another reference to Berserk, as they are often made in Miyazaki's previous Souls games.
        "Logarius and his band of executioners" bear many similarities to Mozgus, an insanely devout man who traveled the land torturing heretics along with his disciples.
        The wheel in particular was wielded by one of his six disciples, .
        In Dark Souls, Bonewheel Skeletons are another reference to Mozgus' disciples.
        In real life, although wheels weren't typically wielded as weapons, they were commonly used as torture devices, especially during the Middle Ages.
        Torture wheels were nicknamed "breaking wheels," since victims often times would have their limbs broken during the process.
        They were also known as "catherine wheels."
         It's quite possible that Logarius' Wheel also takes some inspiration in its use as a weapon from the English folklore legend of Tom Hickathrift. Tom was a fabled giant killer who made use of a cartwheel to vanquish the Wisbech Giant (also referred to as an ogre).
        Lore theories can be found under "From Berserk to Bloodborne".

        Ludwig's Holy Blade
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. It is said that the silver sword was employed by Ludwig, the first hunter of the church. When transformed, it combines with its sheath to form a greatsword. 
        It exhibits several departures from the workshop's design, suggesting that the Church anticipated much larger inhuman beasts."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased for 20,000 echoes from the Messengers after obtaining the Radiant Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon was wielded by Ludwig, a famous hunter of the Healing Church who designed the blade based on the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        According to the description, Ludwig wielded this sword in combat instead of the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        However, in his boss fight, he wields the Holy Moonlight Sword during a certain part in the fight.
        It is possible that Ludwig wielded the Holy Moonlight Sword and his fellow hunters, inspired by the huge weapon, sought to make replicas. Unable to make a magic sword, a huge metal sheath was the compromise.
        Before the DLC's release, Ludwig's Holy Blade was thought of as From Software's traditional "Moonlight Greatsword" seen throughout various games by the fanbase.
        However, this sword was eventually revealed in the DLC to be a replica of the "true" Moonlight Greatsword in Bloodborne, the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        This isn't the first time Miyazaki used the name of classical music composers in a game.
        A boss from the first "Dark Souls" game, Dragonslayer Ornstein, is named after Leo Ornstein.
        Berlioz from "Armored Core 4" is named after Hector Berlioz.
        The normal form of this weapon is very similar to the sword used for the Kirkhammer.
        However, this sword's normal form has a slightly longer reach when compared to the Kirkhammer's blade.
        The similar nature of these swords suggests that the Healing Church used the method of interchangeable parts to quickly mass produce weapons for their hunters.

        Rakuyo
        
        
        Hunter weapon wielded by Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower. 
        A trick sword originated in the same country as the Cainhurst Chikage, only this sword feeds not off blood, but instead demands great dexterity. 
        Lady Maria was fond of this aspect of the Rakuyo, as she frowned upon blood blades, despite being a distant relative of the queen. 
        One day, she abandoned her beloved Rakuyo, casting it into a dark well, when she could stomach it no longer."
        
        
        
        Fishing Hamlet. Get to the bottom of the well. Can be reached from the underground tunnels at the end of the area or via a ladder in the well right away. In that area a Shark Giant will wander around. Fighting him makes a second one appear after the first reaches sufficiently low health. The first giant will walk over near the ladder and scream at the ceiling, causing the second one to drop. The second one drops the weapon.
        Fighting the two of them can be difficult and it is a good idea to use the Shaman Bone Blade to make them fight each other and finish off the weaker one. Molotov cocktails are also very effective against them. If neither is available to you, try to kill the one with the anchor first, as it is significantly harder to dodge.
        One easy way to beat them is use of ranged weapon like Simon's Bowblade if you are a bloodtinge build, and the Holy Moonlight Sword if you are an arcane build.
        A Threaded Cane's transformed whip can easily hit the giants from the ledge once they're lured over and begin attacking, but be sure to keep your distance after each hit. Except that there is no way to lure them over the the ledge. No ranged weapon will hit the one standing at the back and the one hanging from the ceiling doesn't drop down until the first one is at 50% health. 
        Unlike other giants in the game, these ones are easy to gun parry for a visceral attack. Keep in mind this will get very tricky after the other one starts fighting, so try to separate them and time your viscerals to get the invincibility at the right moment.
        If your range is inadequate you can use the monocular to angle a throwing knife to be able to hit the shark giant in the back. This way, you can continue from the strategy of killing them on the ledge with a gun/magic without going around. (confirmed as of January 19th, 2019)
        Chaining together backstabs is a very effecient way of dealing with them, if played right you should be able to eliminate the first shark giant before the second reaches you this way. It is extremely difficult to get behind the patrolling Shark Giant without him detecting you. 
        For a video showing an easy way to kill the sharks with a monocular and a throwing knife strategy, check .
        
        
        
        Rakuyo (ËêΩËëâ) literally means "falling leaf".
        The sword of Rakuyo bears resemblance to the "ky≈´ gunt≈ç", which was a hybrid of the sabre/katana with a handguard, used during the Russo-Japanese War.

        Reiterpallasch
        
        
        Weapon wielded by the Knights of Cainhurst. 
        Combines an elegant knight's sword with the peculiar firearm wielded by the Cainhurst order. 
        The old nobles, long-time imbibers of blood, are no strangers to the sanguine plague, and the disposal of beasts was a discrete task left to their servants, or knights, as they were called for the sake of appearances."
        
        
        
        It's found in a chest located in the entrance hall of Cainhurst Castle, where the Bound Widows are first encountered. When you first enter the room from the main entrance, run towards your two o'clock. The chest will be found in a corner.
        
        
        
        The Reiterpallasch (from German Reiter "horseback rider" and hungarian pallos [Ààp…ílo É] "sword") is a 17th century Hungarian straight sword with a typically double edged blade and guarded hilt that was used by Hungarian noble cavalry and later adapted by most western European armies.
        As pointed out in its description, the rifle spear is made "possibly in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon" (i.e. this one).
        Wynne D. Fanchon from Armored Core: For Answer; another From Software title, pilots a NEXT named Reiterpallasch.

        Rifle Spear
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. A prototype weapon serving as a simple firearm and spear, possibly created in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon. Lacks any notable functions, saving that it is the only trick weapon with an attached gun. "
        
        
        
        It can be found inside a hidden building in Old Yharnam. From the area you fight the first NPC Hunter (who wields a saw spear), drop down where the railing is missing in a corner and land on the ledges below. Go into the building and follow the stairs up; eventually you can find it stashed on a corpse tucked away in a hidden nook as you advance.
        Bought from the messengers for 4000 blood echoes after acquiring the Powder Keg Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        According to the Rifle Spear's description, it was designed as an imitation of "a lost Cainhurst weapon".
        That particular weapon may or may not be the Reiterpallasch.
        It should be noted these two weapons are the only two skill/firearm hybrids whose alternate forms utilize guns.
        The third skill/firearm hybrid weapon in this game is Simon's Bowblade, which transforms from a sword into a bow.
        The Rifle Spear is carried by a Yahar'Gul Hunter in the Cathedral Ward.
        This fight can be tricky because you first encounter a Yahar'Gul Hunter that uses a Tonitrus near the base of the stairs, and if you advance too far towards the houses, the Rifle Spear Yahar'Gul Hunter will join the fight as well.
        He also uses Ludwig's Rifle, meaning he can hit you from a considerable distance with shotgun pellets no matter what mode he uses for the Rifle Spear.

        Saw Cleaver
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used in the hunting business. 
        This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts, transforms into a long cleaver that makes use of centrifugal force. 
        The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness the more grotesquely transformed the beast."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired as a gift from the Messengers the first time you visit the Hunter's Dream.
        If you don't select it, you may buy it after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne.)
        
        
        
        The Saw Cleaver is the Trick Weapon featured on the title screen.
        It was also one of the first weapons to be revealed for this game.
        Overall the mechanisms of this weapon didn't change at all, starting all the way back when Bloodborne was still known as "Project Beast."
        According to the concept art, the Saw Cleaver uses a trigger mechanism to unlock the joint during transformation.
        The design of the Saw Cleaver seems to be inspired by multiple references:
        The transformed cleaver shows a resemblance to LB-66 MOONLIGHT from Armored Core V.
        The Japanese name is written as "nokogiri nata" („Éé„Ç≥„ÇÆ„É™Èâà) or "saw hatchet". Nokogiri is a traditional Japanese saw that cuts from the pull stroke, as opposed to the more common push stroke.
        In real life, there is a type of cleaver known as a mezzaluna ("half moon") cleaver, known for chopping/mincing up various food products.
        Most of these types of cleavers have handles on both ends.
        However, some use a single handle that stretches across the blade, which was used to chop up herbs usually; the saw cleaver follows this particular model.
        Coincidentally, the Strength/Skill/Arcane scaling at maximum level is "CDC" in their respective order.
        The CDC is an American organization designed to combat and prevent "health threats" of varying natures.
        Since the beast scourge acts like a plague (and is spread due to blood-related reasons), those who wield the Saw Cleaver can be thought of as fighting a dangerous epidemic.
        Henryk uses this weapon when he fights you and Eileen the Crow during her questline, as well as when he is summoned by you when using the Old Hunter Bell.

The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness the more grotesquely transformed the beast."
        
        
        
        Can be bought from the Bath Messengers, after obtaining the Saw Hunter Badge, for 1,000 Blood Echoes.
        Treasure in Central Yharnam Sewer, on the ledge above the dead end with boats. You also need to cut down the corpse hanging from the rafters high above.
        
        
        
        Carried by Djura's Ally in Old Yharnam.
        
        
    

        Bloodletter
        
        
        The demented hunter weapon brandished by Brador, the Healing Church assassin. 
        The Bloodletter assumes its true and terrifying form after it draws upon blood from the inner reaches of one's body and soul. 
        This is the only effective means of expelling tainted blood, or so Brador, isolated in his cell, continued to believe."
        
        
        
        Obtain the underground cell inner chamber key.
        Return to the underground prison (from the underground corpse pile lamp, go up the stairs and turn left) and open the door to Brador's cell. His cell is the second on the left behind a flight of downward stairs. Kill Brador to obtain the bloodletter.
        Brador will not be hostile in his cell, but will invade the player right outside his cell.

        Simon's Bowblade
        
        
        Choice weapon of Simon, one of the first Healing Church hunters.
        Simon despised firearms, and so the Church workshop had this specially fashioned to his liking. The large curved blade serves as a bow when transformed.
        But aside from a few close friends, Simon was scoffed at for his choice of arms, for who would dare face the beasts with a measly bow?"
        
        
        
        Fishing Hamlet: Found on the body of Simon the Harrowed next to the Lighthouse Hut lantern after answering the first option at the Hunter's Nightmare shortcut and going through his quest-line. Interact with him as he lies on the ground to obtain the weapon.
        You may also kill Simon the Harrowed at The Hunter's Nightmare or Research Hall to obtain the weapon.

        Stake Driver
        
        
        A trick weapon fashioned by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. Favored by the retired hunter Djura. 
        The stake driver, with its queerly complex design, violently drives thick stakes into the flesh of foes. 
        The stake driver allows for high-damage critical attacks, but is difficult to use and leaves its wielder wide open, but none of this should bother a mere Powder Keg."
        
        
        
        Obtain Powder Keg Hunter Badge to unlock for purchase at the Messengers for 8,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Stake Driver is exclusively wielded by Djura when he is still hostile towards you.
        His fight is tricky because the area around him is very limited, meaning you can fall to your death if you're not careful.
        Furthermore, the limited space is perfect for his choice of weapon which has a short range.
        This is modeled after the "Pile Bunker," a type of fictional weaponry which launches piston with gunpowder or explosion.
        In the Japanese version of Bloodborne, this weapon is literally called the Pile Hammer („Éë„Ç§„É´„Éè„É≥„Éû„Éº).
        It bears a striking resemblance to the "Parrying Blade" weapons seen in several "Armored Core" games.
        Has the highest charged attack multiplier out of any other weapon.

        Threaded Cane
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used by hunters on their duties. Sufficiently deadly as a rigid bladed cane, but also serves as a whip when its blade is split into many. Concealing the weapon inside the cane and flogging the beasts with the whip is partly an act of ceremony, an attempt to demonstrate to oneself that the bloodlust of the hunt will never encroach upon the soul."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired at the beginning of the game as a gift from the Messengers.
        If not selected, it is later available for purchase from the blood fountain messengers after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne).
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is used by Iosefka, Last Scholar Yurie and the Frontier Church Hunter.
        Gehrman carries a generic cane in the Workshop instead of the Threaded Cane.
        This trick weapon is possibly inspired by the sword used by Jean-Fran√ßois de Morangias in the climactic battle of French action-horror film Brotherhood of the Wolf (which bears many other similarities to Bloodborne), or the sword used by a bandit leader in the anime/manga series Claymore. Both these weapons act as a straight, double-edged sword that can transform into a segmented, bladed whip.

        Tonitrus
        
        
        "A unique trick weapon contrived by Archibald, the infamous eccentric of the Healing Church workshop. 
        Striking this peculiar iron morning star flail like a match generates the same blue sparks that blanket a darkbeast. 
        Unfortunately, for reasons untold, the hunters of Archibald's time did not fully take to the device."
        
        
        
        Acquire the Spark Hunter Badge by defeating Darkbeast Paarl  to purchase from Messengers.
        Treasure: Yahar'gul, Unseen Village, at the top end of the road. (guarded by 2 Tainted Dogs and a Snatcher during daytime)
        
        
        
        Tonitrus is a Latin word meaning "thunder."
        The in-game description classifies this trick weapon as a morning star flail, but it's actually modeled in the form of a mace.
        The description of Archibald bears many similarities to Nikola Tesla, a famed inventor in real life who specialized in the field of electricity.
        Nikola Tesla created the Tesla Coil, a device that also bears many similarities to the Tonitrus.
        The Tonitrus also bears similarities with the aspergillum, a device used by the Roman Catholic Church to sprinkle holy water.
        According to the description of the Spark Hunter Badge, Archibald was associated with the Healing Church.
        In this sense, it may have been designed under the themes of "purificiation" and "cleansing" that is associated with many Healing Church trick weapons/tools.
        However, due to Archibald's fascination with Dark Beasts, it's more likely he designed the Tonitrus as a measure to replicate the sparks these creatures could unleash.

        Whirligig Saw
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs, and weapon of choice of the Old Hunter Valtr, the Beast Eater. 
        This weapon pummels beasts in its mace form, but its true strength lies in its attached mechanical saws. 
        These discs, lined with serrated teeth,spin rapidly, thrashing the flesh of beasts into fine shreds."
        
        
        
        From the Nightmare Church go down the stairs and follow the path. Drop down into the pools of blood of follow the path further until you reach the Cannon Executioner. Follow the left wall and turn down the path, the weapon is at the end.
        
        
        
        If you use the L2 buzzsaw attack against Orphan of Kos and hold it in place, it attempts to make an immediate counterattack for each time it gets hit by the whirring blades, only to get interrupted by the next hit. It shrieks every time it attacks, so as a result, it lets loose dozens of overlapping shriek sound effects for as long as you hold it in place.
        A whirligig is defined as a toy that is constantly spinning, such as a top or pinwheel, or as something regarded as hectic and constantly changing.
        Similar to most Powder Keg weapons sharing homage to Armored Core weapons, the Whirligig Saw is based on the Grind Blade.
        
    

        Boom Hammer
        
        
        A trick weapon used by the old hunters, and crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. 
        A giant hammer equipped with a miniature furnace. When ignited and fired, it emits a volley of flame that explodes furiously upon impact. 
        Crush the beasts, then burn them - the brute simplicity of the Boom Hammer was favored by hunters with an acute distaste for beasts."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare. Inside a house that looks out of Central Yharnam, the same that is the shortcut to the cleric beast in the main game, where the 10 quicksilver bullets used to be. Be sure to shoot the explosives around the item (or act fast), as the wheelchair huntsman's corpse conceals a delayed molotov set to trigger when you try to grab the Boom Hammer, potential killing you in a huge blast.
        
        
        
        When the Boomhammer is lit, Beast Patient mobs will back away from the player as if they had a torch equipped. (May need to initiate primed attack first)

        Amygdalan Arm 
        
        
        The arm of a small Amygdala Great One. 
        Strictly speaking, the Amygdalan Arm is no trick weapon of any sort, but certain madmen wield them like clubs. 
        Starts as a large, tough blunt weapon formed of bone, but when extended, the hand quivers as if it were still alive.
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare, cave at the end of the blood river to the right after getting out of the building that used to be the shortcut to the Cleric Beast in the main game. Gatling Gun Hunter dropping the Gatling Gun and a Blood-Starved Beast can be also found here. Arm is near the Blood-Starved Beast at the end of the cave.
        
        
        
        The Amygdalan Arm is a Trick Weapon in name only, considering that it is an arm obtained from Amygdala.
        The arm is remarkably small, as even the Lesser Amygdalae are huge. Perhaps it came from a newborn Amygdala.
        The arm could be the inspiration behind the Burial Blade.

        Beastly weapon wielded by Irreverent Izzy.
        Crafted by chiseling the long bones of an undead darkbeast and fastening them to the weapon. The bones are still alive, and when unleashed, grant its wielder a spurt of beastly power. 
        As flesh is flayed and blood is sprayed, the beast within awakens, and in time, the wielder of this weapon surges with both strength and feverish reverie."
        
        
        
        Ailing Loran Chalice: Layer 2 treasure room. Room is on the right when exiting the elevator from first layer boss fight, before the second layers lantern.
        Can be bought from messengers for 34000 echoes after acquisition.
        Can be bought from messengers after co-operation with player who has them. This only occurs in Hunter's dream before fight with Gehrman or Moon Presence. It is not needed to complete any Chalice Dungeons. It is unknown if this is glitch or intentional. Was patched by 1.07 or 1.08.
        
        
        
        When this weapon is equipped, your gloves will be replaced by two bone gauntlets. This can allow for the lost art of rapid glove changing if you switch your weapons really fast.
        You can charge the beasthood meter on the first windows (Gilbert) of Central Yharnam
        In the past, there was a rare glitch that allowed a player to obtain this weapon without finding it in the Chalice Dungeons.
        It has since been patched, although it isn't quite known when it was successfully patched.

        A trick weapon used by the old hunters. 
        A second blade is found inside the curve of the main one. In its initial form, the saif can be wielded like a long curved sword, but when transformed, its blade is contracted, allowing for quick, repeated stabs. 
        Although this trick weapon allows for adaptive combat, it was later replaced by saws and similar weapons that were more effective at disposing of beasts."

        Beast Cutter
        
        
        A trick weapon used by Old Hunters. 
        This thick iron cleaver slices through the toughest of beast hides, and when transformed the blade splits into sections, allowing one to lash it in the fashion of a heavy whip. 
        This crude weapon relies on brute force and is regrettably inelegant, suggesting that the hunts of the earliest hunters made for horrific affairs, painted in sanguine black and reds."
        
        
        
        When walking up the stairs to the nightmare version of the Grand Cathedral, turn left onto a small platform, then roll off and walk down some rough terrain to find the weapon on a corpse.
        
        
        
        Reminds many of the Zanpakut≈ç , a fictional segmented sword that can function as a whip. It is an iconic weapon from the Bleach anime.
        The untransformed form of the weapon is a cleaver-like serrated club, and it really looks like the samoan war club "Nifo Oti".

        Blade of mercy
        
        
        A special trick weapon passed down among hunters of hunters. One of the oldest weapons of the workshop. 
        Splits into two when activated. The weapon's warped blades are forged with siderite, a rare mineral of the heavens. Most effective swift attacks,such as after a quick-stepping."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers for 40000 echoes after obtaining the Crow Hunter Badge from Eileen the Crow's quest line.
        Killing Eileen is also a way to get the weapon early in the game.
        While progressing through Eileen's quest, it's possible for her to be killed by Henryk and thus drop the Crow Hunter Badge as a result, although the quest line will end.
        
        
        
        The Blade of Mercy was originally named as "Warped Twinblades" during the Alpha test, and it was the tool of choice for the "agile" hunter.
        Both the Burial Blade and Blade of Mercy make mentions of a mineral known as siderite in their descriptions.
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite, and it seems to be the reason why arcane power has direct scaling with both blade's damage output. Due to its extraterrestrial origins, that may explain why it cannot be buffed by an external source of any sort.
        It loosely resembles the Eleum Loyce from Dark Souls 2, a sword with two blades at the front.

        A trick weapon used by the old hunters, and crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. 
        A giant hammer equipped with a miniature furnace. When ignited and fired, it emits a volley of flame that explodes furiously upon impact.

        Bloodletter
        
        
        The demented hunter weapon brandished by Brador, the Healing Church assassin. 
        The Bloodletter assumes its true and terrifying form after it draws upon blood from the inner reaches of one's body and soul. 
        This is the only effective means of expelling tainted blood, or so Brador, isolated in his cell, continued to believe."
        
        
        
        Obtain the underground cell inner chamber key.
        Return to the underground prison (from the underground corpse pile lamp, go up the stairs and turn left) and open the door to Brador's cell. His cell is the second on the left behind a flight of downward stairs. Kill Brador to obtain the bloodletter.
        Brador will not be hostile in his cell, but will invade the player right outside his cell.

        Burial Blade
        
        
        Trick weapon wielded by Gehrman, the first hunter." 
        A masterpiece that defined the entire array of weapons crafted at the workshop. Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens. 
        Gehrman surely saw the hunt as a dirge of farewell, wishing only that his prey might rest in peace, never again to awaken to another harrowing nightmare. "
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 60,000 Blood Echoes after defeating Gehrman, the First Hunter and acquiring the Old Hunter Badge from him.
        To make Gehrman fight you, the "Refuse" option must be selected.
        If one accepts his proposal, the game will outright end there and it will be impossible to obtain this weapon in that playthrough (not including the uncanny/lost forms found in the chalice dungeons).
        Normally, the Burial Blade can only be obtained in NG+ and beyond. However, one can bypass this by using Bold Hunter's Mark, or being killed, during The Moon Presence boss battle.
        
        
        
         The Burial Blade was the first trick weapon ever created, and it inspired others to develop new trick weapons, usually on the premise of adapting to different combat scenerios.
        Not all weapons adapt to different combat scenerios (e.g. Tonitrus), but the Burial Blade still inspired an entire series of weapons that could "transform" to satisfy different purposes.
        It was created, and exclusively wielded, by Gehrman.
        A Burial Blade can be found above the workshop table in the Hunter's Dream.
        The weapon's description mentions that "Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens."
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite. Due to its extraterrestrial nature, it could be the reason why it has direct scaling with arcane and cannot be tampered by external sources.
        Both the Burial Blade and the Blade of Mercy mentions the use of it in their descriptions.
        Interestingly enough, these two weapons also resemble the talons of Mergo's Wet Nurse.
        The shape of the scythe highly resembles Rurufon's scythe from Shadow Tower Abyss, an early title created by From Software as well as being recurring weapons in Souls series.
        A strange bug on rare occurrences the cape on the hunter may come off, usually in a boss fight you could notice if you dodge back and do an R1 combo the cape disappears. [Note, I haven't seen this happen in a while, it's possible that it may have been fixed, but I'll need confirmation on this]

        Chikage
        
        
        Foreign-made weapon wielded by the royal guards who protect Annalise, Queen of the Vilebloods at Cainhurst Castle. 
        When the intricate, rippled engraving that spans the Chikage's blade is imbrued with blood, the sword sings in scarlet hues. 
        However, the rite eats away at the wielder's very essence."
        
        
        
        Join the Cainhurst Vilebloods covenant available at Cainhurst Castle, and then purchase from the Messengers for 50,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Chikage isn't actually a katana - it is a katana/european sword hybrid. Its short crossguard resembles the one of an early viking sword, or the one of a xiphos (greek sword). The closest european crossguard shape with  this sword is the one of a Karabela (a polish sabre). In other hand, the  hilt and pommel resemble the ones of a longsword (a bit longer, to get easier katana traditional jutsu swings), while the blade shape and the 2-handed fighting style is very similar to a katana. A possible explanation for the origin of this hybrid is that the katana's design was imported to Cainhurst, where some modifications were made to create a sword similar to that commonly used by their knights.
        The Chikage is an allusion to a particular 'breed' of Katanas in the Souls games. While it is similar to both the Hiltless and Chaos Blade from Demon's Souls and Dark Souls respectively, the Chikage bears a stronger resemblance to the Magic Sword "Makoto" (also from Demon's Souls). The Makoto is the only one the bunch to actually DRAIN the user's HP over time, rather than decrease it with each successful swing.
        Chikage (ÂçÉÊôØ) literally means "Thousands Views", however if you separated the word into Chi Kage (Ë°ÄÂΩ±), it means "Blood Shadow". This could be correlated to the fact that Shadows Of Yharnam wield a similar katana with a slight  crossguard, however without using the bloodtinge.
        The transforming attack has the hunter sheathe the Chikage before unleashing a strike. This is a reference to Iaijutsu, a traditional Japanese sword technique that focuses on quick-drawing. At its finest, Iaijutse allows the warrior to unsheathe and strike at incredible speeds.
        The name seems to be a tribute to Chikage Yamamura (mentioned as a "special thanks" in credits)
        The name may also be a reference to the work "1000 Plateaus" by Giles Deluze and Felix Guattari, a famous philosophical essay about fluidity and functionality, maybe dirrectly tied to the esoteric nature of the weapons function.

        Church Pick
        
        
        One of the old trick weapons of the Healing Church, a hunting weapon formed from one of the giant picks that appear in old beast tales. 
        The Church Pick initially serves as a large sword, but when transformed functions as an extended war pick. In spite of its origins, it is a highly practical weapon."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Dropped by a hunter wearing Yahar'Gul set (presumably, this is the summonable Old Hunter Defector Antal) in one of the cells that you open with the Underground Cell Key from the Research Hall. To make this battle simple, attack him through the door with a strong R2 attack, then leave the room. He will lose sight of you and his AI will return to a standstill behind the door. Rinse and repeat until dead.
        
        
        
        The Church Pick And The Hunter's Axe both have similar appearance. When transformed, both are wielded as a polearm and have the same de-transformation attack. The only difference apart from the Church Pick having a slightly more complicated mechanism is that the Hunter's Axe is a strength-based weapon.
        A few of its attacks in the transformed mode are very similar to that of the Burial Blade.
        The Church Pick os the weapon of choice of the summonable Old Hunter NPC Defector Antal

        Holy Moonlight Sword
        
        
        An arcane sword discovered long ago by Ludwig. 
        When blue moonlight dances around the sword, and it channels the abyssal cosmos, its great blade will hurl a shadowy lightwave. 
        The Holy Moonlight Sword is synonymous with Ludwig, the Holy Blade, but few have ever set eyes on the great blade, and whatever guidance it has to offer, it seems to be of a very private, elusive sort."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Found on the Underground Corpse Pile after the fight against Ludwig, The Holy Blade. Ludwig's head will be lying there and you can:
        Kill the head for the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and talk to the head. When prompted, reply "Yes" and you'll get the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and reply "No", then come back later and Simon the Harrowed will be there and give you the sword.
        NOTE: This weapon is missable. If Lawrence is killed before you obtain it, you will no longer be able to talk to the head or obtain it from Simon.
        
        
        
        It seems to be another reappearance of the Moonlight Greatsword, a recurring item found around FromSoftware's games. Notable examples of such games include the first, second and third Dark Souls games, Demon's Souls, King's Field, Ninja Blade, Enchanted Arms, Armored Core, 3D Dot Game Heroes, and Otogi.

        Hunter Axe
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used on the hunt. Retains the qualities of an axe, but offers a wider palette of attacks by transforming. Boasts a heavy blunt attack, leading to high rally potential. No matter their pasts, beasts are no more than beasts. Some choose this axe to play the part of executioner."
        
        
        
        It's possible to pick this trick weapon as a starting weapon near the beginning of Bloodborne.
        If not chosen, it can instead be purchased from the Messengers after the Hunter has found the Saw Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is wielded by Father Gascoigne.
        However, he has a moveset that is different from the Hunter's version.
        He is also capable of using his unique Hunter Pistol even while his Hunter Axe is transformed, which is impossible for the Hunter to do.
        It's also wielded by the Madara's Twin who drops Madara's Whistle when defeated.
        Another hostile hunter NPC wields this trick weapon in the Nightmare Frontier.
        It's been heavily debated by the fanbase whether the transformed mode is a halberd or poleaxe.
        Both forms utilized axe heads with a spear tip at the end (although some poleaxes used hammer heads instead).
        However, neither weapon was known to have extendable handles, which is a special trademark of the Hunter Axe.
        In either case, it's possible this trick weapon was inspired by both weapons and simply incorporated many different designs.
        While wielded in it's transformed mode if the player had a torch equipped in the off-hand beasts afraid of the fire will still recoil in fear of you as if you were brandishing the torch normally (Tested on Beast Patient)

        Kirkhammer
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. On the one side, an easily handled silver sword. On the other, a giant obtuse stone weapon, characterized by a blunt strike and extreme force of impact. The Church takes a heavy-handed, merciless stance toward the plague of beasts, an irony not lost upon the wielders of this most symbolic weapon."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers after acquiring the Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        A miniature of the Kirkhammer was included as the Pre-Order Bonus for Asian editions of Bloodborne. [See the Bundles page for details]
        A "kirk" is an archaic old english word meaning "church."
        This means the weapon is literately known as the Church Hammer.
        The wording also might be a nod to Nordic culture since the word "Kirk" originated from northern England and Old Norse wording.
        The etched wording on the side of the hammer part has similarities to the Old Norse alphabet.
        However, it also has similarities to the Elder Futhark, one of the oldest forms of the runic alphabet system used by Germanic tribes.
        Similar etchings can be found on gravestones all over Yharnam.
        The sword used for this weapon is very similar to the one used for Ludwig's Holy Blade.
        This suggests that the Healing Church used the method of "interchangeable parts" to efficiently mass produce weapons for their hunters.
        However, the sword used for the Kirkhammer is shorter.
        It's wielded by Alfred, should you choose to be friends with him.
        He uses this weapon as a summon.
        However, he wields the Logarius' Wheel if you find him in Cainhurst Castle under special circumstances.
        When untransformed, with the hammer part on the character's back, some cloth parts (capes etc.) of the armor can either get awkwardly stuck on it or cover it.
        Despite being labeled a 'stone weapon', the etchings, wear, and sound produced when it strikes indicate that the hammer is in fact made of metal.

        Kos Parasite
        
        
        When the carcass of Kos washed up on the coast, its insides were teeming with tiny parasites, unlike any found in humans. 
        This atypical weapon can only be clasped tight and swung, but a Kos Parasite is said to stimulate phantasms inhabiting a lumenwood"
        
        
        
        Dropped by Orphan of Kos
        
        
        
        The Kos Parasite is perhaps the most interestingly unique weapon in Bloodborne in various ways: It is one of two weapons that can reach it's full potential while using a rune (the other being Beast Claw), the weapon itself is not held, it is purely an arcane weapon, it is the only weapon directly dropped by defeating a boss, it has the highest durability of any weapon at 600 respectively, it is the only weapon to have an A-scaling of any weapon without any upgrades and is the only weapon to have an S-scaling by upgrading it twice.

        Logarius's Wheel
        
        
        "Weapon wielded by martyr Logarius' band of executioners. 
        Used to slaughter the Vilebloods in Cainhurst. Bathed in pools of their blood, and forever steeped in their ire. 
        Transform to release the power of the wheel and manifest their lingering rage in a show of utter brilliance."
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 13,000 Blood Echoes after acquiring the Wheel Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        Alfred utilizes the Logarius' Wheel when found in Cainhurst Castle.
        This weapon is yet another reference to Berserk, as they are often made in Miyazaki's previous Souls games.
        "Logarius and his band of executioners" bear many similarities to Mozgus, an insanely devout man who traveled the land torturing heretics along with his disciples.
        The wheel in particular was wielded by one of his six disciples, .
        In Dark Souls, Bonewheel Skeletons are another reference to Mozgus' disciples.
        In real life, although wheels weren't typically wielded as weapons, they were commonly used as torture devices, especially during the Middle Ages.
        Torture wheels were nicknamed "breaking wheels," since victims often times would have their limbs broken during the process.
        They were also known as "catherine wheels."
         It's quite possible that Logarius' Wheel also takes some inspiration in its use as a weapon from the English folklore legend of Tom Hickathrift. Tom was a fabled giant killer who made use of a cartwheel to vanquish the Wisbech Giant (also referred to as an ogre).
        Lore theories can be found under "From Berserk to Bloodborne".

        Ludwig's Holy Blade
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. It is said that the silver sword was employed by Ludwig, the first hunter of the church. When transformed, it combines with its sheath to form a greatsword. 
        It exhibits several departures from the workshop's design, suggesting that the Church anticipated much larger inhuman beasts."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased for 20,000 echoes from the Messengers after obtaining the Radiant Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon was wielded by Ludwig, a famous hunter of the Healing Church who designed the blade based on the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        According to the description, Ludwig wielded this sword in combat instead of the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        However, in his boss fight, he wields the Holy Moonlight Sword during a certain part in the fight.
        It is possible that Ludwig wielded the Holy Moonlight Sword and his fellow hunters, inspired by the huge weapon, sought to make replicas. Unable to make a magic sword, a huge metal sheath was the compromise.
        Before the DLC's release, Ludwig's Holy Blade was thought of as From Software's traditional "Moonlight Greatsword" seen throughout various games by the fanbase.
        However, this sword was eventually revealed in the DLC to be a replica of the "true" Moonlight Greatsword in Bloodborne, the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        This isn't the first time Miyazaki used the name of classical music composers in a game.
        A boss from the first "Dark Souls" game, Dragonslayer Ornstein, is named after Leo Ornstein.
        Berlioz from "Armored Core 4" is named after Hector Berlioz.
        The normal form of this weapon is very similar to the sword used for the Kirkhammer.
        However, this sword's normal form has a slightly longer reach when compared to the Kirkhammer's blade.
        The similar nature of these swords suggests that the Healing Church used the method of interchangeable parts to quickly mass produce weapons for their hunters.

        Rakuyo
        
        
        Hunter weapon wielded by Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower. 
        A trick sword originated in the same country as the Cainhurst Chikage, only this sword feeds not off blood, but instead demands great dexterity. 
        Lady Maria was fond of this aspect of the Rakuyo, as she frowned upon blood blades, despite being a distant relative of the queen. 
        One day, she abandoned her beloved Rakuyo, casting it into a dark well, when she could stomach it no longer."
        
        
        
        Fishing Hamlet. Get to the bottom of the well. Can be reached from the underground tunnels at the end of the area or via a ladder in the well right away. In that area a Shark Giant will wander around. Fighting him makes a second one appear after the first reaches sufficiently low health. The first giant will walk over near the ladder and scream at the ceiling, causing the second one to drop. The second one drops the weapon.
        Fighting the two of them can be difficult and it is a good idea to use the Shaman Bone Blade to make them fight each other and finish off the weaker one. Molotov cocktails are also very effective against them. If neither is available to you, try to kill the one with the anchor first, as it is significantly harder to dodge.
        One easy way to beat them is use of ranged weapon like Simon's Bowblade if you are a bloodtinge build, and the Holy Moonlight Sword if you are an arcane build.
        A Threaded Cane's transformed whip can easily hit the giants from the ledge once they're lured over and begin attacking, but be sure to keep your distance after each hit. Except that there is no way to lure them over the the ledge. No ranged weapon will hit the one standing at the back and the one hanging from the ceiling doesn't drop down until the first one is at 50% health. 
        Unlike other giants in the game, these ones are easy to gun parry for a visceral attack. Keep in mind this will get very tricky after the other one starts fighting, so try to separate them and time your viscerals to get the invincibility at the right moment.
        If your range is inadequate you can use the monocular to angle a throwing knife to be able to hit the shark giant in the back. This way, you can continue from the strategy of killing them on the ledge with a gun/magic without going around. (confirmed as of January 19th, 2019)
        Chaining together backstabs is a very effecient way of dealing with them, if played right you should be able to eliminate the first shark giant before the second reaches you this way. It is extremely difficult to get behind the patrolling Shark Giant without him detecting you. 
        For a video showing an easy way to kill the sharks with a monocular and a throwing knife strategy, check .
        
        
        
        Rakuyo (ËêΩËëâ) literally means "falling leaf".
        The sword of Rakuyo bears resemblance to the "ky≈´ gunt≈ç", which was a hybrid of the sabre/katana with a handguard, used during the Russo-Japanese War.

        Reiterpallasch
        
        
        Weapon wielded by the Knights of Cainhurst. 
        Combines an elegant knight's sword with the peculiar firearm wielded by the Cainhurst order. 
        The old nobles, long-time imbibers of blood, are no strangers to the sanguine plague, and the disposal of beasts was a discrete task left to their servants, or knights, as they were called for the sake of appearances."
        
        
        
        It's found in a chest located in the entrance hall of Cainhurst Castle, where the Bound Widows are first encountered. When you first enter the room from the main entrance, run towards your two o'clock. The chest will be found in a corner.
        
        
        
        The Reiterpallasch (from German Reiter "horseback rider" and hungarian pallos [Ààp…ílo É] "sword") is a 17th century Hungarian straight sword with a typically double edged blade and guarded hilt that was used by Hungarian noble cavalry and later adapted by most western European armies.
        As pointed out in its description, the rifle spear is made "possibly in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon" (i.e. this one).
        Wynne D. Fanchon from Armored Core: For Answer; another From Software title, pilots a NEXT named Reiterpallasch.

        Rifle Spear
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. A prototype weapon serving as a simple firearm and spear, possibly created in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon. Lacks any notable functions, saving that it is the only trick weapon with an attached gun. "
        
        
        
        It can be found inside a hidden building in Old Yharnam. From the area you fight the first NPC Hunter (who wields a saw spear), drop down where the railing is missing in a corner and land on the ledges below. Go into the building and follow the stairs up; eventually you can find it stashed on a corpse tucked away in a hidden nook as you advance.
        Bought from the messengers for 4000 blood echoes after acquiring the Powder Keg Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        According to the Rifle Spear's description, it was designed as an imitation of "a lost Cainhurst weapon".
        That particular weapon may or may not be the Reiterpallasch.
        It should be noted these two weapons are the only two skill/firearm hybrids whose alternate forms utilize guns.
        The third skill/firearm hybrid weapon in this game is Simon's Bowblade, which transforms from a sword into a bow.
        The Rifle Spear is carried by a Yahar'Gul Hunter in the Cathedral Ward.
        This fight can be tricky because you first encounter a Yahar'Gul Hunter that uses a Tonitrus near the base of the stairs, and if you advance too far towards the houses, the Rifle Spear Yahar'Gul Hunter will join the fight as well.
        He also uses Ludwig's Rifle, meaning he can hit you from a considerable distance with shotgun pellets no matter what mode he uses for the Rifle Spear.

        Saw Cleaver
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used in the hunting business. 
        This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts, transforms into a long cleaver that makes use of centrifugal force. 
        The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness the more grotesquely transformed the beast."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired as a gift from the Messengers the first time you visit the Hunter's Dream.
        If you don't select it, you may buy it after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne.)
        
        
        
        The Saw Cleaver is the Trick Weapon featured on the title screen.
        It was also one of the first weapons to be revealed for this game.
        Overall the mechanisms of this weapon didn't change at all, starting all the way back when Bloodborne was still known as "Project Beast."
        According to the concept art, the Saw Cleaver uses a trigger mechanism to unlock the joint during transformation.
        The design of the Saw Cleaver seems to be inspired by multiple references:
        The transformed cleaver shows a resemblance to LB-66 MOONLIGHT from Armored Core V.
        The Japanese name is written as "nokogiri nata" („Éé„Ç≥„ÇÆ„É™Èâà) or "saw hatchet". Nokogiri is a traditional Japanese saw that cuts from the pull stroke, as opposed to the more common push stroke.
        In real life, there is a type of cleaver known as a mezzaluna ("half moon") cleaver, known for chopping/mincing up various food products.
        Most of these types of cleavers have handles on both ends.
        However, some use a single handle that stretches across the blade, which was used to chop up herbs usually; the saw cleaver follows this particular model.
        Coincidentally, the Strength/Skill/Arcane scaling at maximum level is "CDC" in their respective order.
        The CDC is an American organization designed to combat and prevent "health threats" of varying natures.
        Since the beast scourge acts like a plague (and is spread due to blood-related reasons), those who wield the Saw Cleaver can be thought of as fighting a dangerous epidemic.
        Henryk uses this weapon when he fights you and Eileen the Crow during her questline, as well as when he is summoned by you when using the Old Hunter Bell.

        Simon despised firearms, and so the Church workshop had this specially fashioned to his liking. The large curved blade serves as a bow when transformed.
        But aside from a few close friends, Simon was scoffed at for his choice of arms, for who would dare face the beasts with a measly bow?"

        Stake Driver
        
        
        A trick weapon fashioned by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. Favored by the retired hunter Djura. 
        The stake driver, with its queerly complex design, violently drives thick stakes into the flesh of foes. 
        The stake driver allows for high-damage critical attacks, but is difficult to use and leaves its wielder wide open, but none of this should bother a mere Powder Keg."
        
        
        
        Obtain Powder Keg Hunter Badge to unlock for purchase at the Messengers for 8,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Stake Driver is exclusively wielded by Djura when he is still hostile towards you.
        His fight is tricky because the area around him is very limited, meaning you can fall to your death if you're not careful.
        Furthermore, the limited space is perfect for his choice of weapon which has a short range.
        This is modeled after the "Pile Bunker," a type of fictional weaponry which launches piston with gunpowder or explosion.
        In the Japanese version of Bloodborne, this weapon is literally called the Pile Hammer („Éë„Ç§„É´„Éè„É≥„Éû„Éº).
        It bears a striking resemblance to the "Parrying Blade" weapons seen in several "Armored Core" games.
        Has the highest charged attack multiplier out of any other weapon.
        
        
    

        Boom Hammer
        
        
        A trick weapon used by the old hunters, and crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. 
        A giant hammer equipped with a miniature furnace. When ignited and fired, it emits a volley of flame that explodes furiously upon impact. 
        Crush the beasts, then burn them - the brute simplicity of the Boom Hammer was favored by hunters with an acute distaste for beasts."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare. Inside a house that looks out of Central Yharnam, the same that is the shortcut to the cleric beast in the main game, where the 10 quicksilver bullets used to be. Be sure to shoot the explosives around the item (or act fast), as the wheelchair huntsman's corpse conceals a delayed molotov set to trigger when you try to grab the Boom Hammer, potential killing you in a huge blast.
        
        
        
        When the Boomhammer is lit, Beast Patient mobs will back away from the player as if they had a torch equipped. (May need to initiate primed attack first)

        Threaded Cane
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used by hunters on their duties. Sufficiently deadly as a rigid bladed cane, but also serves as a whip when its blade is split into many. Concealing the weapon inside the cane and flogging the beasts with the whip is partly an act of ceremony, an attempt to demonstrate to oneself that the bloodlust of the hunt will never encroach upon the soul."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired at the beginning of the game as a gift from the Messengers.
        If not selected, it is later available for purchase from the blood fountain messengers after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne).
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is used by Iosefka, Last Scholar Yurie and the Frontier Church Hunter.
        Gehrman carries a generic cane in the Workshop instead of the Threaded Cane.
        This trick weapon is possibly inspired by the sword used by Jean-Fran√ßois de Morangias in the climactic battle of French action-horror film Brotherhood of the Wolf (which bears many other similarities to Bloodborne), or the sword used by a bandit leader in the anime/manga series Claymore. Both these weapons act as a straight, double-edged sword that can transform into a segmented, bladed whip.

        Tonitrus
        
        
        "A unique trick weapon contrived by Archibald, the infamous eccentric of the Healing Church workshop. 
        Striking this peculiar iron morning star flail like a match generates the same blue sparks that blanket a darkbeast. 
        Unfortunately, for reasons untold, the hunters of Archibald's time did not fully take to the device."
        
        
        
        Acquire the Spark Hunter Badge by defeating Darkbeast Paarl  to purchase from Messengers.
        Treasure: Yahar'gul, Unseen Village, at the top end of the road. (guarded by 2 Tainted Dogs and a Snatcher during daytime)
        
        
        
        Tonitrus is a Latin word meaning "thunder."
        The in-game description classifies this trick weapon as a morning star flail, but it's actually modeled in the form of a mace.
        The description of Archibald bears many similarities to Nikola Tesla, a famed inventor in real life who specialized in the field of electricity.
        Nikola Tesla created the Tesla Coil, a device that also bears many similarities to the Tonitrus.
        The Tonitrus also bears similarities with the aspergillum, a device used by the Roman Catholic Church to sprinkle holy water.
        According to the description of the Spark Hunter Badge, Archibald was associated with the Healing Church.
        In this sense, it may have been designed under the themes of "purificiation" and "cleansing" that is associated with many Healing Church trick weapons/tools.
        However, due to Archibald's fascination with Dark Beasts, it's more likely he designed the Tonitrus as a measure to replicate the sparks these creatures could unleash.

        Whirligig Saw
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs, and weapon of choice of the Old Hunter Valtr, the Beast Eater. 
        This weapon pummels beasts in its mace form, but its true strength lies in its attached mechanical saws. 
        These discs, lined with serrated teeth,spin rapidly, thrashing the flesh of beasts into fine shreds."
        
        
        
        From the Nightmare Church go down the stairs and follow the path. Drop down into the pools of blood of follow the path further until you reach the Cannon Executioner. Follow the left wall and turn down the path, the weapon is at the end.
        
        
        
        If you use the L2 buzzsaw attack against Orphan of Kos and hold it in place, it attempts to make an immediate counterattack for each time it gets hit by the whirring blades, only to get interrupted by the next hit. It shrieks every time it attacks, so as a result, it lets loose dozens of overlapping shriek sound effects for as long as you hold it in place.
        A whirligig is defined as a toy that is constantly spinning, such as a top or pinwheel, or as something regarded as hectic and constantly changing.
        Similar to most Powder Keg weapons sharing homage to Armored Core weapons, the Whirligig Saw is based on the Grind Blade.
        
    

        Burial Blade
        
        
        Trick weapon wielded by Gehrman, the first hunter." 
        A masterpiece that defined the entire array of weapons crafted at the workshop. Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens. 
        Gehrman surely saw the hunt as a dirge of farewell, wishing only that his prey might rest in peace, never again to awaken to another harrowing nightmare. "
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 60,000 Blood Echoes after defeating Gehrman, the First Hunter and acquiring the Old Hunter Badge from him.
        To make Gehrman fight you, the "Refuse" option must be selected.
        If one accepts his proposal, the game will outright end there and it will be impossible to obtain this weapon in that playthrough (not including the uncanny/lost forms found in the chalice dungeons).
        Normally, the Burial Blade can only be obtained in NG+ and beyond. However, one can bypass this by using Bold Hunter's Mark, or being killed, during The Moon Presence boss battle.
        
        
        
         The Burial Blade was the first trick weapon ever created, and it inspired others to develop new trick weapons, usually on the premise of adapting to different combat scenerios.
        Not all weapons adapt to different combat scenerios (e.g. Tonitrus), but the Burial Blade still inspired an entire series of weapons that could "transform" to satisfy different purposes.
        It was created, and exclusively wielded, by Gehrman.
        A Burial Blade can be found above the workshop table in the Hunter's Dream.
        The weapon's description mentions that "Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens."
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite. Due to its extraterrestrial nature, it could be the reason why it has direct scaling with arcane and cannot be tampered by external sources.
        Both the Burial Blade and the Blade of Mercy mentions the use of it in their descriptions.
        Interestingly enough, these two weapons also resemble the talons of Mergo's Wet Nurse.
        The shape of the scythe highly resembles Rurufon's scythe from Shadow Tower Abyss, an early title created by From Software as well as being recurring weapons in Souls series.
        A strange bug on rare occurrences the cape on the hunter may come off, usually in a boss fight you could notice if you dodge back and do an R1 combo the cape disappears. [Note, I haven't seen this happen in a while, it's possible that it may have been fixed, but I'll need confirmation on this]

        Amygdalan Arm 
        
        
        The arm of a small Amygdala Great One. 
        Strictly speaking, the Amygdalan Arm is no trick weapon of any sort, but certain madmen wield them like clubs. 
        Starts as a large, tough blunt weapon formed of bone, but when extended, the hand quivers as if it were still alive.
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare, cave at the end of the blood river to the right after getting out of the building that used to be the shortcut to the Cleric Beast in the main game. Gatling Gun Hunter dropping the Gatling Gun and a Blood-Starved Beast can be also found here. Arm is near the Blood-Starved Beast at the end of the cave.
        
        
        
        The Amygdalan Arm is a Trick Weapon in name only, considering that it is an arm obtained from Amygdala.
        The arm is remarkably small, as even the Lesser Amygdalae are huge. Perhaps it came from a newborn Amygdala.
        The arm could be the inspiration behind the Burial Blade.

        Beastly weapon wielded by Irreverent Izzy.
        Crafted by chiseling the long bones of an undead darkbeast and fastening them to the weapon. The bones are still alive, and when unleashed, grant its wielder a spurt of beastly power. 
        As flesh is flayed and blood is sprayed, the beast within awakens, and in time, the wielder of this weapon surges with both strength and feverish reverie."

        Can be bought from messengers for 34000 echoes after acquisition.
        Can be bought from messengers after co-operation with player who has them. This only occurs in Hunter's dream before fight with Gehrman or Moon Presence. It is not needed to complete any Chalice Dungeons. It is unknown if this is glitch or intentional. Was patched by 1.07 or 1.08.
        
        
        
        When this weapon is equipped, your gloves will be replaced by two bone gauntlets. This can allow for the lost art of rapid glove changing if you switch your weapons really fast.
        You can charge the beasthood meter on the first windows (Gilbert) of Central Yharnam
        In the past, there was a rare glitch that allowed a player to obtain this weapon without finding it in the Chalice Dungeons.
        It has since been patched, although it isn't quite known when it was successfully patched.

        This thick iron cleaver slices through the toughest of beast hides, and when transformed the blade splits into sections, allowing one to lash it in the fashion of a heavy whip. 
        This crude weapon relies on brute force and is regrettably inelegant, suggesting that the hunts of the earliest hunters made for horrific affairs, painted in sanguine black and reds."

        Reminds many of the Zanpakut≈ç , a fictional segmented sword that can function as a whip. It is an iconic weapon from the Bleach anime.

        A special trick weapon passed down among hunters of hunters. One of the oldest weapons of the workshop. 
        Splits into two when activated. The weapon's warped blades are forged with siderite, a rare mineral of the heavens. Most effective swift attacks,such as after a quick-stepping."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers for 40000 echoes after obtaining the Crow Hunter Badge from Eileen the Crow's quest line.
        Killing Eileen is also a way to get the weapon early in the game.
        While progressing through Eileen's quest, it's possible for her to be killed by Henryk and thus drop the Crow Hunter Badge as a result, although the quest line will end.
        
        
        
        The Blade of Mercy was originally named as "Warped Twinblades" during the Alpha test, and it was the tool of choice for the "agile" hunter.
        Both the Burial Blade and Blade of Mercy make mentions of a mineral known as siderite in their descriptions.
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite, and it seems to be the reason why arcane power has direct scaling with both blade's damage output. Due to its extraterrestrial origins, that may explain why it cannot be buffed by an external source of any sort.
        It loosely resembles the Eleum Loyce from Dark Souls 2, a sword with two blades at the front.
        
        
    

        Burial Blade
        
        
        Trick weapon wielded by Gehrman, the first hunter." 
        A masterpiece that defined the entire array of weapons crafted at the workshop. Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens. 
        Gehrman surely saw the hunt as a dirge of farewell, wishing only that his prey might rest in peace, never again to awaken to another harrowing nightmare. "
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 60,000 Blood Echoes after defeating Gehrman, the First Hunter and acquiring the Old Hunter Badge from him.
        To make Gehrman fight you, the "Refuse" option must be selected.
        If one accepts his proposal, the game will outright end there and it will be impossible to obtain this weapon in that playthrough (not including the uncanny/lost forms found in the chalice dungeons).
        Normally, the Burial Blade can only be obtained in NG+ and beyond. However, one can bypass this by using Bold Hunter's Mark, or being killed, during The Moon Presence boss battle.
        
        
        
         The Burial Blade was the first trick weapon ever created, and it inspired others to develop new trick weapons, usually on the premise of adapting to different combat scenerios.
        Not all weapons adapt to different combat scenerios (e.g. Tonitrus), but the Burial Blade still inspired an entire series of weapons that could "transform" to satisfy different purposes.
        It was created, and exclusively wielded, by Gehrman.
        A Burial Blade can be found above the workshop table in the Hunter's Dream.
        The weapon's description mentions that "Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens."

        Interestingly enough, these two weapons also resemble the talons of Mergo's Wet Nurse.
        The shape of the scythe highly resembles Rurufon's scythe from Shadow Tower Abyss, an early title created by From Software as well as being recurring weapons in Souls series.
        A strange bug on rare occurrences the cape on the hunter may come off, usually in a boss fight you could notice if you dodge back and do an R1 combo the cape disappears.

        Bloodletter
        
        
        The demented hunter weapon brandished by Brador, the Healing Church assassin. 
        The Bloodletter assumes its true and terrifying form after it draws upon blood from the inner reaches of one's body and soul. 
        This is the only effective means of expelling tainted blood, or so Brador, isolated in his cell, continued to believe."
        
        
        
        Obtain the underground cell inner chamber key.
        Return to the underground prison (from the underground corpse pile lamp, go up the stairs and turn left) and open the door to Brador's cell. His cell is the second on the left behind a flight of downward stairs. Kill Brador to obtain the bloodletter.
        Brador will not be hostile in his cell, but will invade the player right outside his cell.

        Chikage
        
        
        Foreign-made weapon wielded by the royal guards who protect Annalise, Queen of the Vilebloods at Cainhurst Castle. 
        When the intricate, rippled engraving that spans the Chikage's blade is imbrued with blood, the sword sings in scarlet hues. 
        However, the rite eats away at the wielder's very essence."
        
        
        
        Join the Cainhurst Vilebloods covenant available at Cainhurst Castle, and then purchase from the Messengers for 50,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Chikage isn't actually a katana - it is a katana/european sword hybrid. Its short crossguard resembles the one of an early viking sword, or the one of a xiphos (greek sword). The closest european crossguard shape with  this sword is the one of a Karabela (a polish sabre). In other hand, the  hilt and pommel resemble the ones of a longsword (a bit longer, to get easier katana traditional jutsu swings), while the blade shape and the 2-handed fighting style is very similar to a katana. A possible explanation for the origin of this hybrid is that the katana's design was imported to Cainhurst, where some modifications were made to create a sword similar to that commonly used by their knights.
        The Chikage is an allusion to a particular 'breed' of Katanas in the Souls games. While it is similar to both the Hiltless and Chaos Blade from Demon's Souls and Dark Souls respectively, the Chikage bears a stronger resemblance to the Magic Sword "Makoto" (also from Demon's Souls). The Makoto is the only one the bunch to actually DRAIN the user's HP over time, rather than decrease it with each successful swing.
        Chikage (ÂçÉÊôØ) literally means "Thousands Views", however if you separated the word into Chi Kage (Ë°ÄÂΩ±), it means "Blood Shadow". This could be correlated to the fact that Shadows Of Yharnam wield a similar katana with a slight  crossguard, however without using the bloodtinge.
        The transforming attack has the hunter sheathe the Chikage before unleashing a strike. This is a reference to Iaijutsu, a traditional Japanese sword technique that focuses on quick-drawing. At its finest, Iaijutse allows the warrior to unsheathe and strike at incredible speeds.
        The name seems to be a tribute to Chikage Yamamura (mentioned as a "special thanks" in credits)
        The name may also be a reference to the work "1000 Plateaus" by Giles Deluze and Felix Guattari, a famous philosophical essay about fluidity and functionality, maybe dirrectly tied to the esoteric nature of the weapons function.

        Church Pick
        
        
        One of the old trick weapons of the Healing Church, a hunting weapon formed from one of the giant picks that appear in old beast tales. 
        The Church Pick initially serves as a large sword, but when transformed functions as an extended war pick. In spite of its origins, it is a highly practical weapon."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Dropped by a hunter wearing Yahar'Gul set (presumably, this is the summonable Old Hunter Defector Antal) in one of the cells that you open with the Underground Cell Key from the Research Hall. To make this battle simple, attack him through the door with a strong R2 attack, then leave the room. He will lose sight of you and his AI will return to a standstill behind the door. Rinse and repeat until dead.
        
        
        
        The Church Pick And The Hunter's Axe both have similar appearance. When transformed, both are wielded as a polearm and have the same de-transformation attack. The only difference apart from the Church Pick having a slightly more complicated mechanism is that the Hunter's Axe is a strength-based weapon.
        A few of its attacks in the transformed mode are very similar to that of the Burial Blade.

        Wear a piece of any church attire and talk to the head. When prompted, reply "Yes" and you'll get the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and reply "No", then come back later and Simon the Harrowed will be there and give you the sword.
        NOTE: This weapon is missable. If Lawrence is killed before you obtain it, you will no longer be able to talk to the head or obtain it from Simon.
        
        
        
        It seems to be another reappearance of the Moonlight Greatsword, a recurring item found around FromSoftware's games. Notable examples of such games include the first, second and third Dark Souls games, Demon's Souls, King's Field, Ninja Blade, Enchanted Arms, Armored Core, 3D Dot Game Heroes, and Otogi.

        Burial Blade
        
        
        Trick weapon wielded by Gehrman, the first hunter." 
        A masterpiece that defined the entire array of weapons crafted at the workshop. Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens. 
        Gehrman surely saw the hunt as a dirge of farewell, wishing only that his prey might rest in peace, never again to awaken to another harrowing nightmare. "
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 60,000 Blood Echoes after defeating Gehrman, the First Hunter and acquiring the Old Hunter Badge from him.
        To make Gehrman fight you, the "Refuse" option must be selected.
        If one accepts his proposal, the game will outright end there and it will be impossible to obtain this weapon in that playthrough (not including the uncanny/lost forms found in the chalice dungeons).
        Normally, the Burial Blade can only be obtained in NG+ and beyond. However, one can bypass this by using Bold Hunter's Mark, or being killed, during The Moon Presence boss battle.
        
        
        
         The Burial Blade was the first trick weapon ever created, and it inspired others to develop new trick weapons, usually on the premise of adapting to different combat scenerios.
        Not all weapons adapt to different combat scenerios (e.g. Tonitrus), but the Burial Blade still inspired an entire series of weapons that could "transform" to satisfy different purposes.
        It was created, and exclusively wielded, by Gehrman.
        A Burial Blade can be found above the workshop table in the Hunter's Dream.
        The weapon's description mentions that "Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens."
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite. Due to its extraterrestrial nature, it could be the reason why it has direct scaling with arcane and cannot be tampered by external sources.
        Both the Burial Blade and the Blade of Mercy mentions the use of it in their descriptions.
        Interestingly enough, these two weapons also resemble the talons of Mergo's Wet Nurse.
        The shape of the scythe highly resembles Rurufon's scythe from Shadow Tower Abyss, an early title created by From Software as well as being recurring weapons in Souls series.
        A strange bug on rare occurrences the cape on the hunter may come off, usually in a boss fight you could notice if you dodge back and do an R1 combo the cape disappears. [Note, I haven't seen this happen in a while, it's possible that it may have been fixed, but I'll need confirmation on this]

        Hunter Axe
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used on the hunt. Retains the qualities of an axe, but offers a wider palette of attacks by transforming. Boasts a heavy blunt attack, leading to high rally potential. No matter their pasts, beasts are no more than beasts. Some choose this axe to play the part of executioner."
        
        
        
        It's possible to pick this trick weapon as a starting weapon near the beginning of Bloodborne.
        If not chosen, it can instead be purchased from the Messengers after the Hunter has found the Saw Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is wielded by Father Gascoigne.
        However, he has a moveset that is different from the Hunter's version.
        He is also capable of using his unique Hunter Pistol even while his Hunter Axe is transformed, which is impossible for the Hunter to do.
        It's also wielded by the Madara's Twin who drops Madara's Whistle when defeated.
        Another hostile hunter NPC wields this trick weapon in the Nightmare Frontier.
        It's been heavily debated by the fanbase whether the transformed mode is a halberd or poleaxe.
        Both forms utilized axe heads with a spear tip at the end (although some poleaxes used hammer heads instead).
        However, neither weapon was known to have extendable handles, which is a special trademark of the Hunter Axe.
        In either case, it's possible this trick weapon was inspired by both weapons and simply incorporated many different designs.
        While wielded in it's transformed mode if the player had a torch equipped in the off-hand beasts afraid of the fire will still recoil in fear of you as if you were brandishing the torch normally (Tested on Beast Patient)

        Kirkhammer
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. On the one side, an easily handled silver sword. On the other, a giant obtuse stone weapon, characterized by a blunt strike and extreme force of impact. The Church takes a heavy-handed, merciless stance toward the plague of beasts, an irony not lost upon the wielders of this most symbolic weapon."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers after acquiring the Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        A miniature of the Kirkhammer was included as the Pre-Order Bonus for Asian editions of Bloodborne. [See the Bundles page for details]
        A "kirk" is an archaic old english word meaning "church."
        This means the weapon is literately known as the Church Hammer.
        The wording also might be a nod to Nordic culture since the word "Kirk" originated from northern England and Old Norse wording.
        The etched wording on the side of the hammer part has similarities to the Old Norse alphabet.
        However, it also has similarities to the Elder Futhark, one of the oldest forms of the runic alphabet system used by Germanic tribes.
        Similar etchings can be found on gravestones all over Yharnam.
        The sword used for this weapon is very similar to the one used for Ludwig's Holy Blade.
        This suggests that the Healing Church used the method of "interchangeable parts" to efficiently mass produce weapons for their hunters.
        However, the sword used for the Kirkhammer is shorter.
        It's wielded by Alfred, should you choose to be friends with him.
        He uses this weapon as a summon.
        However, he wields the Logarius' Wheel if you find him in Cainhurst Castle under special circumstances.
        When untransformed, with the hammer part on the character's back, some cloth parts (capes etc.) of the armor can either get awkwardly stuck on it or cover it.
        Despite being labeled a 'stone weapon', the etchings, wear, and sound produced when it strikes indicate that the hammer is in fact made of metal.

        Kos Parasite
        
        
        When the carcass of Kos washed up on the coast, its insides were teeming with tiny parasites, unlike any found in humans. 
        This atypical weapon can only be clasped tight and swung, but a Kos Parasite is said to stimulate phantasms inhabiting a lumenwood"
        
        
        
        Dropped by Orphan of Kos
        
        
        
        The Kos Parasite is perhaps the most interestingly unique weapon in Bloodborne in various ways: It is one of two weapons that can reach it's full potential while using a rune (the other being Beast Claw), the weapon itself is not held, it is purely an arcane weapon, it is the only weapon directly dropped by defeating a boss, it has the highest durability of any weapon at 600 respectively, it is the only weapon to have an A-scaling of any weapon without any upgrades and is the only weapon to have an S-scaling by upgrading it twice.

        Logarius's Wheel
        
        
        "Weapon wielded by martyr Logarius' band of executioners. 
        Used to slaughter the Vilebloods in Cainhurst. Bathed in pools of their blood, and forever steeped in their ire. 
        Transform to release the power of the wheel and manifest their lingering rage in a show of utter brilliance."
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 13,000 Blood Echoes after acquiring the Wheel Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        Alfred utilizes the Logarius' Wheel when found in Cainhurst Castle.
        This weapon is yet another reference to Berserk, as they are often made in Miyazaki's previous Souls games.
        "Logarius and his band of executioners" bear many similarities to Mozgus, an insanely devout man who traveled the land torturing heretics along with his disciples.
        The wheel in particular was wielded by one of his six disciples, .
        In Dark Souls, Bonewheel Skeletons are another reference to Mozgus' disciples.
        In real life, although wheels weren't typically wielded as weapons, they were commonly used as torture devices, especially during the Middle Ages.
        Torture wheels were nicknamed "breaking wheels," since victims often times would have their limbs broken during the process.
        They were also known as "catherine wheels."
         It's quite possible that Logarius' Wheel also takes some inspiration in its use as a weapon from the English folklore legend of Tom Hickathrift. Tom was a fabled giant killer who made use of a cartwheel to vanquish the Wisbech Giant (also referred to as an ogre).
        Lore theories can be found under "From Berserk to Bloodborne".

        Ludwig's Holy Blade
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. It is said that the silver sword was employed by Ludwig, the first hunter of the church. When transformed, it combines with its sheath to form a greatsword. 
        It exhibits several departures from the workshop's design, suggesting that the Church anticipated much larger inhuman beasts."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased for 20,000 echoes from the Messengers after obtaining the Radiant Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon was wielded by Ludwig, a famous hunter of the Healing Church who designed the blade based on the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        According to the description, Ludwig wielded this sword in combat instead of the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        However, in his boss fight, he wields the Holy Moonlight Sword during a certain part in the fight.
        It is possible that Ludwig wielded the Holy Moonlight Sword and his fellow hunters, inspired by the huge weapon, sought to make replicas. Unable to make a magic sword, a huge metal sheath was the compromise.
        Before the DLC's release, Ludwig's Holy Blade was thought of as From Software's traditional "Moonlight Greatsword" seen throughout various games by the fanbase.
        However, this sword was eventually revealed in the DLC to be a replica of the "true" Moonlight Greatsword in Bloodborne, the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        This isn't the first time Miyazaki used the name of classical music composers in a game.
        A boss from the first "Dark Souls" game, Dragonslayer Ornstein, is named after Leo Ornstein.
        Berlioz from "Armored Core 4" is named after Hector Berlioz.
        The normal form of this weapon is very similar to the sword used for the Kirkhammer.
        However, this sword's normal form has a slightly longer reach when compared to the Kirkhammer's blade.
        The similar nature of these swords suggests that the Healing Church used the method of interchangeable parts to quickly mass produce weapons for their hunters.

        Lady Maria was fond of this aspect of the Rakuyo, as she frowned upon blood blades, despite being a distant relative of the queen. 
        One day, she abandoned her beloved Rakuyo, casting it into a dark well, when she could stomach it no longer."

        Fighting the two of them can be difficult and it is a good idea to use the Shaman Bone Blade to make them fight each other and finish off the weaker one. Molotov cocktails are also very effective against them. If neither is available to you, try to kill the one with the anchor first, as it is significantly harder to dodge.
        One easy way to beat them is use of ranged weapon like Simon's Bowblade if you are a bloodtinge build, and the Holy Moonlight Sword if you are an arcane build.
        A Threaded Cane's transformed whip can easily hit the giants from the ledge once they're lured over and begin attacking, but be sure to keep your distance after each hit. Except that there is no way to lure them over the the ledge. No ranged weapon will hit the one standing at the back and the one hanging from the ceiling doesn't drop down until the first one is at 50% health. 
        Unlike other giants in the game, these ones are easy to gun parry for a visceral attack. Keep in mind this will get very tricky after the other one starts fighting, so try to separate them and time your viscerals to get the invincibility at the right moment.
        If your range is inadequate you can use the monocular to angle a throwing knife to be able to hit the shark giant in the back. This way, you can continue from the strategy of killing them on the ledge with a gun/magic without going around. (confirmed as of January 19th, 2019)
        Chaining together backstabs is a very effecient way of dealing with them, if played right you should be able to eliminate the first shark giant before the second reaches you this way. It is extremely difficult to get behind the patrolling Shark Giant without him detecting you.

        Rakuyo (ËêΩËëâ) literally means "falling leaf".
        The sword of Rakuyo bears resemblance to the "ky≈´ gunt≈ç", which was a hybrid of the sabre/katana with a handguard, used during the Russo-Japanese War.

        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 60,000 Blood Echoes after defeating Gehrman, the First Hunter and acquiring the Old Hunter Badge from him.
        To make Gehrman fight you, the "Refuse" option must be selected.
        If one accepts his proposal, the game will outright end there and it will be impossible to obtain this weapon in that playthrough (not including the uncanny/lost forms found in the chalice dungeons).
        Normally, the Burial Blade can only be obtained in NG+ and beyond. However, one can bypass this by using Bold Hunter's Mark, or being killed, during The Moon Presence boss battle.
        
        
        
         The Burial Blade was the first trick weapon ever created, and it inspired others to develop new trick weapons, usually on the premise of adapting to different combat scenerios.
        Not all weapons adapt to different combat scenerios (e.g. Tonitrus), but the Burial Blade still inspired an entire series of weapons that could "transform" to satisfy different purposes.
        It was created, and exclusively wielded, by Gehrman.

        Interestingly enough, these two weapons also resemble the talons of Mergo's Wet Nurse.
        The shape of the scythe highly resembles Rurufon's scythe from Shadow Tower Abyss, an early title created by From Software as well as being recurring weapons in Souls series.

        Reiterpallasch
        
        
        Weapon wielded by the Knights of Cainhurst. 
        Combines an elegant knight's sword with the peculiar firearm wielded by the Cainhurst order. 
        The old nobles, long-time imbibers of blood, are no strangers to the sanguine plague, and the disposal of beasts was a discrete task left to their servants, or knights, as they were called for the sake of appearances."
        
        
        
        It's found in a chest located in the entrance hall of Cainhurst Castle, where the Bound Widows are first encountered. When you first enter the room from the main entrance, run towards your two o'clock. The chest will be found in a corner.
        
        
        
        The Reiterpallasch (from German Reiter "horseback rider" and hungarian pallos [Ààp…ílo É] "sword") is a 17th century Hungarian straight sword with a typically double edged blade and guarded hilt that was used by Hungarian noble cavalry and later adapted by most western European armies.
        As pointed out in its description, the rifle spear is made "possibly in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon" (i.e. this one).
        Wynne D. Fanchon from Armored Core: For Answer; another From Software title, pilots a NEXT named Reiterpallasch.
        Relevant lore theories exist under The Mysteries of Cainhurst Garb and Architecture.

        Rifle Spear
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. A prototype weapon serving as a simple firearm and spear, possibly created in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon. Lacks any notable functions, saving that it is the only trick weapon with an attached gun. "
        
        
        
        It can be found inside a hidden building in Old Yharnam. From the area you fight the first NPC Hunter (who wields a saw spear), drop down where the railing is missing in a corner and land on the ledges below. Go into the building and follow the stairs up; eventually you can find it stashed on a corpse tucked away in a hidden nook as you advance.
        Bought from the messengers for 4000 blood echoes after acquiring the Powder Keg Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        According to the Rifle Spear's description, it was designed as an imitation of "a lost Cainhurst weapon".
        That particular weapon may or may not be the Reiterpallasch.
        It should be noted these two weapons are the only two skill/firearm hybrids whose alternate forms utilize guns.
        The third skill/firearm hybrid weapon in this game is Simon's Bowblade, which transforms from a sword into a bow.
        The Rifle Spear is carried by a Yahar'Gul Hunter in the Cathedral Ward.
        This fight can be tricky because you first encounter a Yahar'Gul Hunter that uses a Tonitrus near the base of the stairs, and if you advance too far towards the houses, the Rifle Spear Yahar'Gul Hunter will join the fight as well.
        He also uses Ludwig's Rifle, meaning he can hit you from a considerable distance with shotgun pellets no matter what mode he uses for the Rifle Spear.

        Saw Cleaver
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used in the hunting business. 
        This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts, transforms into a long cleaver that makes use of centrifugal force. 
        The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness the more grotesquely transformed the beast."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired as a gift from the Messengers the first time you visit the Hunter's Dream.
        If you don't select it, you may buy it after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne.)
        
        
        
        The Saw Cleaver is the Trick Weapon featured on the title screen.
        It was also one of the first weapons to be revealed for this game.
        Overall the mechanisms of this weapon didn't change at all, starting all the way back when Bloodborne was still known as "Project Beast."
        According to the concept art, the Saw Cleaver uses a trigger mechanism to unlock the joint during transformation.
        The design of the Saw Cleaver seems to be inspired by multiple references:
        The transformed cleaver shows a resemblance to LB-66 MOONLIGHT from Armored Core V.
        The Japanese name is written as "nokogiri nata" („Éé„Ç≥„ÇÆ„É™Èâà) or "saw hatchet". Nokogiri is a traditional Japanese saw that cuts from the pull stroke, as opposed to the more common push stroke.
        In real life, there is a type of cleaver known as a mezzaluna ("half moon") cleaver, known for chopping/mincing up various food products.
        Most of these types of cleavers have handles on both ends.
        However, some use a single handle that stretches across the blade, which was used to chop up herbs usually; the saw cleaver follows this particular model.
        Coincidentally, the Strength/Skill/Arcane scaling at maximum level is "CDC" in their respective order.
        The CDC is an American organization designed to combat and prevent "health threats" of varying natures.
        Since the beast scourge acts like a plague (and is spread due to blood-related reasons), those who wield the Saw Cleaver can be thought of as fighting a dangerous epidemic.
        Henryk uses this weapon when he fights you and Eileen the Crow during her questline, as well as when he is summoned by you when using the Old Hunter Bell.

        The stake driver, with its queerly complex design, violently drives thick stakes into the flesh of foes. 
        The stake driver allows for high-damage critical attacks, but is difficult to use and leaves its wielder wide open, but none of this should bother a mere Powder Keg."
        
        
        
        Obtain Powder Keg Hunter Badge to unlock for purchase at the Messengers for 8,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Stake Driver is exclusively wielded by Djura when he is still hostile towards you.
        His fight is tricky because the area around him is very limited, meaning you can fall to your death if you're not careful.
        Furthermore, the limited space is perfect for his choice of weapon which has a short range.
        This is modeled after the "Pile Bunker," a type of fictional weaponry which launches piston with gunpowder or explosion.
        In the Japanese version of Bloodborne, this weapon is literally called the Pile Hammer („Éë„Ç§„É´„Éè„É≥„Éû„Éº).
        It bears a striking resemblance to the "Parrying Blade" weapons seen in several "Armored Core" games.
        Has the highest charged attack multiplier out of any other weapon.
        
        
    

        Burial Blade
        
        
        Trick weapon wielded by Gehrman, the first hunter." 
        A masterpiece that defined the entire array of weapons crafted at the workshop. Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens. 
        Gehrman surely saw the hunt as a dirge of farewell, wishing only that his prey might rest in peace, never again to awaken to another harrowing nightmare. "
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 60,000 Blood Echoes after defeating Gehrman, the First Hunter and acquiring the Old Hunter Badge from him.
        To make Gehrman fight you, the "Refuse" option must be selected.
        If one accepts his proposal, the game will outright end there and it will be impossible to obtain this weapon in that playthrough (not including the uncanny/lost forms found in the chalice dungeons).
        Normally, the Burial Blade can only be obtained in NG+ and beyond. However, one can bypass this by using Bold Hunter's Mark, or being killed, during The Moon Presence boss battle.
        
        
        
         The Burial Blade was the first trick weapon ever created, and it inspired others to develop new trick weapons, usually on the premise of adapting to different combat scenerios.
        Not all weapons adapt to different combat scenerios (e.g. Tonitrus), but the Burial Blade still inspired an entire series of weapons that could "transform" to satisfy different purposes.
        It was created, and exclusively wielded, by Gehrman.
        A Burial Blade can be found above the workshop table in the Hunter's Dream.
        The weapon's description mentions that "Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens."
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite. Due to its extraterrestrial nature, it could be the reason why it has direct scaling with arcane and cannot be tampered by external sources.
        Both the Burial Blade and the Blade of Mercy mentions the use of it in their descriptions.
        Interestingly enough, these two weapons also resemble the talons of Mergo's Wet Nurse.
        The shape of the scythe highly resembles Rurufon's scythe from Shadow Tower Abyss, an early title created by From Software as well as being recurring weapons in Souls series.
        A strange bug on rare occurrences the cape on the hunter may come off, usually in a boss fight you could notice if you dodge back and do an R1 combo the cape disappears. [Note, I haven't seen this happen in a while, it's possible that it may have been fixed, but I'll need confirmation on this]

        Threaded Cane
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used by hunters on their duties. Sufficiently deadly as a rigid bladed cane, but also serves as a whip when its blade is split into many. Concealing the weapon inside the cane and flogging the beasts with the whip is partly an act of ceremony, an attempt to demonstrate to oneself that the bloodlust of the hunt will never encroach upon the soul."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired at the beginning of the game as a gift from the Messengers.
        If not selected, it is later available for purchase from the blood fountain messengers after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne).
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is used by Iosefka, Last Scholar Yurie and the Frontier Church Hunter.
        Gehrman carries a generic cane in the Workshop instead of the Threaded Cane.
        This trick weapon is possibly inspired by the sword used by Jean-Fran√ßois de Morangias in the climactic battle of French action-horror film Brotherhood of the Wolf (which bears many other similarities to Bloodborne), or the sword used by a bandit leader in the anime/manga series Claymore. Both these weapons act as a straight, double-edged sword that can transform into a segmented, bladed whip.

        Tonitrus
        
        
        "A unique trick weapon contrived by Archibald, the infamous eccentric of the Healing Church workshop. 
        Striking this peculiar iron morning star flail like a match generates the same blue sparks that blanket a darkbeast. 
        Unfortunately, for reasons untold, the hunters of Archibald's time did not fully take to the device."
        
        
        
        Acquire the Spark Hunter Badge by defeating Darkbeast Paarl  to purchase from Messengers.
        Treasure: Yahar'gul, Unseen Village, at the top end of the road. (guarded by 2 Tainted Dogs and a Snatcher during daytime)
        
        
        
        Tonitrus is a Latin word meaning "thunder."
        The in-game description classifies this trick weapon as a morning star flail, but it's actually modeled in the form of a mace.
        The description of Archibald bears many similarities to Nikola Tesla, a famed inventor in real life who specialized in the field of electricity.
        Nikola Tesla created the Tesla Coil, a device that also bears many similarities to the Tonitrus.
        The Tonitrus also bears similarities with the aspergillum, a device used by the Roman Catholic Church to sprinkle holy water.
        According to the description of the Spark Hunter Badge, Archibald was associated with the Healing Church.
        In this sense, it may have been designed under the themes of "purificiation" and "cleansing" that is associated with many Healing Church trick weapons/tools.
        However, due to Archibald's fascination with Dark Beasts, it's more likely he designed the Tonitrus as a measure to replicate the sparks these creatures could unleash.

        Whirligig Saw
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs, and weapon of choice of the Old Hunter Valtr, the Beast Eater. 
        This weapon pummels beasts in its mace form, but its true strength lies in its attached mechanical saws. 
        These discs, lined with serrated teeth,spin rapidly, thrashing the flesh of beasts into fine shreds."
        
        
        
        From the Nightmare Church go down the stairs and follow the path. Drop down into the pools of blood of follow the path further until you reach the Cannon Executioner. Follow the left wall and turn down the path, the weapon is at the end.
        
        
        
        If you use the L2 buzzsaw attack against Orphan of Kos and hold it in place, it attempts to make an immediate counterattack for each time it gets hit by the whirring blades, only to get interrupted by the next hit. It shrieks every time it attacks, so as a result, it lets loose dozens of overlapping shriek sound effects for as long as you hold it in place.
        A whirligig is defined as a toy that is constantly spinning, such as a top or pinwheel, or as something regarded as hectic and constantly changing.
        Similar to most Powder Keg weapons sharing homage to Armored Core weapons, the Whirligig Saw is based on the Grind Blade.
        
    

        Chikage
        
        
        Foreign-made weapon wielded by the royal guards who protect Annalise, Queen of the Vilebloods at Cainhurst Castle. 
        When the intricate, rippled engraving that spans the Chikage's blade is imbrued with blood, the sword sings in scarlet hues. 
        However, the rite eats away at the wielder's very essence."
        
        
        
        Join the Cainhurst Vilebloods covenant available at Cainhurst Castle, and then purchase from the Messengers for 50,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Chikage isn't actually a katana - it is a katana/european sword hybrid. Its short crossguard resembles the one of an early viking sword, or the one of a xiphos (greek sword). The closest european crossguard shape with  this sword is the one of a Karabela (a polish sabre). In other hand, the  hilt and pommel resemble the ones of a longsword (a bit longer, to get easier katana traditional jutsu swings), while the blade shape and the 2-handed fighting style is very similar to a katana. A possible explanation for the origin of this hybrid is that the katana's design was imported to Cainhurst, where some modifications were made to create a sword similar to that commonly used by their knights.
        The Chikage is an allusion to a particular 'breed' of Katanas in the Souls games. While it is similar to both the Hiltless and Chaos Blade from Demon's Souls and Dark Souls respectively, the Chikage bears a stronger resemblance to the Magic Sword "Makoto" (also from Demon's Souls). The Makoto is the only one the bunch to actually DRAIN the user's HP over time, rather than decrease it with each successful swing.
        Chikage (ÂçÉÊôØ) literally means "Thousands Views", however if you separated the word into Chi Kage (Ë°ÄÂΩ±), it means "Blood Shadow". This could be correlated to the fact that Shadows Of Yharnam wield a similar katana with a slight  crossguard, however without using the bloodtinge.
        The transforming attack has the hunter sheathe the Chikage before unleashing a strike. This is a reference to Iaijutsu, a traditional Japanese sword technique that focuses on quick-drawing. At its finest, Iaijutse allows the warrior to unsheathe and strike at incredible speeds.
        The name seems to be a tribute to Chikage Yamamura (mentioned as a "special thanks" in credits)
        The name may also be a reference to the work "1000 Plateaus" by Giles Deluze and Felix Guattari, a famous philosophical essay about fluidity and functionality, maybe dirrectly tied to the esoteric nature of the weapons function.

        Amygdalan Arm 
        
        
        The arm of a small Amygdala Great One. 
        Strictly speaking, the Amygdalan Arm is no trick weapon of any sort, but certain madmen wield them like clubs. 
        Starts as a large, tough blunt weapon formed of bone, but when extended, the hand quivers as if it were still alive.
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare, cave at the end of the blood river to the right after getting out of the building that used to be the shortcut to the Cleric Beast in the main game. Gatling Gun Hunter dropping the Gatling Gun and a Blood-Starved Beast can be also found here. Arm is near the Blood-Starved Beast at the end of the cave.
        
        
        
        The Amygdalan Arm is a Trick Weapon in name only, considering that it is an arm obtained from Amygdala.
        The arm is remarkably small, as even the Lesser Amygdalae are huge. Perhaps it came from a newborn Amygdala.
        The arm could be the inspiration behind the Burial Blade.

        Can be bought from messengers after co-operation with player who has them. This only occurs in Hunter's dream before fight with Gehrman or Moon Presence. It is not needed to complete any Chalice Dungeons. It is unknown if this is glitch or intentional. Was patched by 1.07 or 1.08.
        
        
        
        When this weapon is equipped, your gloves will be replaced by two bone gauntlets. This can allow for the lost art of rapid glove changing if you switch your weapons really fast.
        You can charge the beasthood meter on the first windows (Gilbert) of Central Yharnam
        In the past, there was a rare glitch that allowed a player to obtain this weapon without finding it in the Chalice Dungeons.

        Beast Cutter
        
        
        A trick weapon used by Old Hunters. 
        This thick iron cleaver slices through the toughest of beast hides, and when transformed the blade splits into sections, allowing one to lash it in the fashion of a heavy whip. 
        This crude weapon relies on brute force and is regrettably inelegant, suggesting that the hunts of the earliest hunters made for horrific affairs, painted in sanguine black and reds."
        
        
        
        When walking up the stairs to the nightmare version of the Grand Cathedral, turn left onto a small platform, then roll off and walk down some rough terrain to find the weapon on a corpse.
        
        
        
        Reminds many of the Zanpakut≈ç , a fictional segmented sword that can function as a whip. It is an iconic weapon from the Bleach anime.
        The untransformed form of the weapon is a cleaver-like serrated club, and it really looks like the samoan war club "Nifo Oti".

        When the intricate, rippled engraving that spans the Chikage's blade is imbrued with blood, the sword sings in scarlet hues.

        The Chikage isn't actually a katana - it is a katana/european sword hybrid. Its short crossguard resembles the one of an early viking sword, or the one of a xiphos (greek sword). The closest european crossguard shape with  this sword is the one of a Karabela (a polish sabre). In other hand, the  hilt and pommel resemble the ones of a longsword (a bit longer, to get easier katana traditional jutsu swings), while the blade shape and the 2-handed fighting style is very similar to a katana. A possible explanation for the origin of this hybrid is that the katana's design was imported to Cainhurst, where some modifications were made to create a sword similar to that commonly used by their knights.
        The Chikage is an allusion to a particular 'breed' of Katanas in the Souls games. While it is similar to both the Hiltless and Chaos Blade from Demon's Souls and Dark Souls respectively, the Chikage bears a stronger resemblance to the Magic Sword "Makoto" (also from Demon's Souls). The Makoto is the only one the bunch to actually DRAIN the user's HP over time, rather than decrease it with each successful swing.

        Blade of mercy
        
        
        A special trick weapon passed down among hunters of hunters. One of the oldest weapons of the workshop. 
        Splits into two when activated. The weapon's warped blades are forged with siderite, a rare mineral of the heavens. Most effective swift attacks,such as after a quick-stepping."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers for 40000 echoes after obtaining the Crow Hunter Badge from Eileen the Crow's quest line.
        Killing Eileen is also a way to get the weapon early in the game.
        While progressing through Eileen's quest, it's possible for her to be killed by Henryk and thus drop the Crow Hunter Badge as a result, although the quest line will end.
        
        
        
        The Blade of Mercy was originally named as "Warped Twinblades" during the Alpha test, and it was the tool of choice for the "agile" hunter.
        Both the Burial Blade and Blade of Mercy make mentions of a mineral known as siderite in their descriptions.
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite, and it seems to be the reason why arcane power has direct scaling with both blade's damage output. Due to its extraterrestrial origins, that may explain why it cannot be buffed by an external source of any sort.
        It loosely resembles the Eleum Loyce from Dark Souls 2, a sword with two blades at the front.

        This is the only effective means of expelling tainted blood, or so Brador, isolated in his cell, continued to believe."
        
        
        
        Obtain the underground cell inner chamber key.
        Return to the underground prison (from the underground corpse pile lamp, go up the stairs and turn left) and open the door to Brador's cell. His cell is the second on the left behind a flight of downward stairs. Kill Brador to obtain the bloodletter.
        Brador will not be hostile in his cell, but will invade the player right outside his cell.

        Burial Blade
        
        
        Trick weapon wielded by Gehrman, the first hunter." 
        A masterpiece that defined the entire array of weapons crafted at the workshop. Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens. 
        Gehrman surely saw the hunt as a dirge of farewell, wishing only that his prey might rest in peace, never again to awaken to another harrowing nightmare. "
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 60,000 Blood Echoes after defeating Gehrman, the First Hunter and acquiring the Old Hunter Badge from him.
        To make Gehrman fight you, the "Refuse" option must be selected.
        If one accepts his proposal, the game will outright end there and it will be impossible to obtain this weapon in that playthrough (not including the uncanny/lost forms found in the chalice dungeons).
        Normally, the Burial Blade can only be obtained in NG+ and beyond. However, one can bypass this by using Bold Hunter's Mark, or being killed, during The Moon Presence boss battle.
        
        
        
         The Burial Blade was the first trick weapon ever created, and it inspired others to develop new trick weapons, usually on the premise of adapting to different combat scenerios.
        Not all weapons adapt to different combat scenerios (e.g. Tonitrus), but the Burial Blade still inspired an entire series of weapons that could "transform" to satisfy different purposes.
        It was created, and exclusively wielded, by Gehrman.
        A Burial Blade can be found above the workshop table in the Hunter's Dream.
        The weapon's description mentions that "Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens."
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite. Due to its extraterrestrial nature, it could be the reason why it has direct scaling with arcane and cannot be tampered by external sources.
        Both the Burial Blade and the Blade of Mercy mentions the use of it in their descriptions.
        Interestingly enough, these two weapons also resemble the talons of Mergo's Wet Nurse.
        The shape of the scythe highly resembles Rurufon's scythe from Shadow Tower Abyss, an early title created by From Software as well as being recurring weapons in Souls series.
        A strange bug on rare occurrences the cape on the hunter may come off, usually in a boss fight you could notice if you dodge back and do an R1 combo the cape disappears. [Note, I haven't seen this happen in a while, it's possible that it may have been fixed, but I'll need confirmation on this]

        The Church Pick initially serves as a large sword, but when transformed functions as an extended war pick. In spite of its origins, it is a highly practical weapon."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Dropped by a hunter wearing Yahar'Gul set (presumably, this is the summonable Old Hunter Defector Antal) in one of the cells that you open with the Underground Cell Key from the Research Hall. To make this battle simple, attack him through the door with a strong R2 attack, then leave the room. He will lose sight of you and his AI will return to a standstill behind the door. Rinse and repeat until dead.
        
        
        
        The Church Pick And The Hunter's Axe both have similar appearance. When transformed, both are wielded as a polearm and have the same de-transformation attack. The only difference apart from the Church Pick having a slightly more complicated mechanism is that the Hunter's Axe is a strength-based weapon.
        A few of its attacks in the transformed mode are very similar to that of the Burial Blade.

        Chikage
        
        
        Foreign-made weapon wielded by the royal guards who protect Annalise, Queen of the Vilebloods at Cainhurst Castle. 
        When the intricate, rippled engraving that spans the Chikage's blade is imbrued with blood, the sword sings in scarlet hues. 
        However, the rite eats away at the wielder's very essence."
        
        
        
        Join the Cainhurst Vilebloods covenant available at Cainhurst Castle, and then purchase from the Messengers for 50,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Chikage isn't actually a katana - it is a katana/european sword hybrid. Its short crossguard resembles the one of an early viking sword, or the one of a xiphos (greek sword). The closest european crossguard shape with  this sword is the one of a Karabela (a polish sabre). In other hand, the  hilt and pommel resemble the ones of a longsword (a bit longer, to get easier katana traditional jutsu swings), while the blade shape and the 2-handed fighting style is very similar to a katana. A possible explanation for the origin of this hybrid is that the katana's design was imported to Cainhurst, where some modifications were made to create a sword similar to that commonly used by their knights.
        The Chikage is an allusion to a particular 'breed' of Katanas in the Souls games. While it is similar to both the Hiltless and Chaos Blade from Demon's Souls and Dark Souls respectively, the Chikage bears a stronger resemblance to the Magic Sword "Makoto" (also from Demon's Souls). The Makoto is the only one the bunch to actually DRAIN the user's HP over time, rather than decrease it with each successful swing.
        Chikage (ÂçÉÊôØ) literally means "Thousands Views", however if you separated the word into Chi Kage (Ë°ÄÂΩ±), it means "Blood Shadow". This could be correlated to the fact that Shadows Of Yharnam wield a similar katana with a slight  crossguard, however without using the bloodtinge.
        The transforming attack has the hunter sheathe the Chikage before unleashing a strike. This is a reference to Iaijutsu, a traditional Japanese sword technique that focuses on quick-drawing. At its finest, Iaijutse allows the warrior to unsheathe and strike at incredible speeds.
        The name seems to be a tribute to Chikage Yamamura (mentioned as a "special thanks" in credits)
        The name may also be a reference to the work "1000 Plateaus" by Giles Deluze and Felix Guattari, a famous philosophical essay about fluidity and functionality, maybe dirrectly tied to the esoteric nature of the weapons function.

        Holy Moonlight Sword
        
        
        An arcane sword discovered long ago by Ludwig. 
        When blue moonlight dances around the sword, and it channels the abyssal cosmos, its great blade will hurl a shadowy lightwave. 
        The Holy Moonlight Sword is synonymous with Ludwig, the Holy Blade, but few have ever set eyes on the great blade, and whatever guidance it has to offer, it seems to be of a very private, elusive sort."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Found on the Underground Corpse Pile after the fight against Ludwig, The Holy Blade. Ludwig's head will be lying there and you can:
        Kill the head for the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and talk to the head. When prompted, reply "Yes" and you'll get the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and reply "No", then come back later and Simon the Harrowed will be there and give you the sword.
        NOTE: This weapon is missable. If Lawrence is killed before you obtain it, you will no longer be able to talk to the head or obtain it from Simon.
        
        
        
        It seems to be another reappearance of the Moonlight Greatsword, a recurring item found around FromSoftware's games. Notable examples of such games include the first, second and third Dark Souls games, Demon's Souls, King's Field, Ninja Blade, Enchanted Arms, Armored Core, 3D Dot Game Heroes, and Otogi.
        Lore theories exist under "Ebrietas Lore".

        Hunter Axe
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used on the hunt. Retains the qualities of an axe, but offers a wider palette of attacks by transforming. Boasts a heavy blunt attack, leading to high rally potential. No matter their pasts, beasts are no more than beasts. Some choose this axe to play the part of executioner."
        
        
        
        It's possible to pick this trick weapon as a starting weapon near the beginning of Bloodborne.
        If not chosen, it can instead be purchased from the Messengers after the Hunter has found the Saw Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is wielded by Father Gascoigne.
        However, he has a moveset that is different from the Hunter's version.
        He is also capable of using his unique Hunter Pistol even while his Hunter Axe is transformed, which is impossible for the Hunter to do.
        It's also wielded by the Madara's Twin who drops Madara's Whistle when defeated.
        Another hostile hunter NPC wields this trick weapon in the Nightmare Frontier.
        It's been heavily debated by the fanbase whether the transformed mode is a halberd or poleaxe.
        Both forms utilized axe heads with a spear tip at the end (although some poleaxes used hammer heads instead).
        However, neither weapon was known to have extendable handles, which is a special trademark of the Hunter Axe.
        In either case, it's possible this trick weapon was inspired by both weapons and simply incorporated many different designs.
        While wielded in it's transformed mode if the player had a torch equipped in the off-hand beasts afraid of the fire will still recoil in fear of you as if you were brandishing the torch normally (Tested on Beast Patient)

        Kirkhammer
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. On the one side, an easily handled silver sword. On the other, a giant obtuse stone weapon, characterized by a blunt strike and extreme force of impact. The Church takes a heavy-handed, merciless stance toward the plague of beasts, an irony not lost upon the wielders of this most symbolic weapon."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers after acquiring the Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        A miniature of the Kirkhammer was included as the Pre-Order Bonus for Asian editions of Bloodborne. [See the Bundles page for details]
        A "kirk" is an archaic old english word meaning "church."
        This means the weapon is literately known as the Church Hammer.
        The wording also might be a nod to Nordic culture since the word "Kirk" originated from northern England and Old Norse wording.
        The etched wording on the side of the hammer part has similarities to the Old Norse alphabet.
        However, it also has similarities to the Elder Futhark, one of the oldest forms of the runic alphabet system used by Germanic tribes.
        Similar etchings can be found on gravestones all over Yharnam.
        The sword used for this weapon is very similar to the one used for Ludwig's Holy Blade.
        This suggests that the Healing Church used the method of "interchangeable parts" to efficiently mass produce weapons for their hunters.
        However, the sword used for the Kirkhammer is shorter.
        It's wielded by Alfred, should you choose to be friends with him.
        He uses this weapon as a summon.
        However, he wields the Logarius' Wheel if you find him in Cainhurst Castle under special circumstances.
        When untransformed, with the hammer part on the character's back, some cloth parts (capes etc.) of the armor can either get awkwardly stuck on it or cover it.
        Despite being labeled a 'stone weapon', the etchings, wear, and sound produced when it strikes indicate that the hammer is in fact made of metal.

        Kos Parasite
        
        
        When the carcass of Kos washed up on the coast, its insides were teeming with tiny parasites, unlike any found in humans. 
        This atypical weapon can only be clasped tight and swung, but a Kos Parasite is said to stimulate phantasms inhabiting a lumenwood"
        
        
        
        Dropped by Orphan of Kos
        
        
        
        The Kos Parasite is perhaps the most interestingly unique weapon in Bloodborne in various ways: It is one of two weapons that can reach it's full potential while using a rune (the other being Beast Claw), the weapon itself is not held, it is purely an arcane weapon, it is the only weapon directly dropped by defeating a boss, it has the highest durability of any weapon at 600 respectively, it is the only weapon to have an A-scaling of any weapon without any upgrades and is the only weapon to have an S-scaling by upgrading it twice.

        Logarius's Wheel
        
        
        "Weapon wielded by martyr Logarius' band of executioners. 
        Used to slaughter the Vilebloods in Cainhurst. Bathed in pools of their blood, and forever steeped in their ire. 
        Transform to release the power of the wheel and manifest their lingering rage in a show of utter brilliance."
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 13,000 Blood Echoes after acquiring the Wheel Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        Alfred utilizes the Logarius' Wheel when found in Cainhurst Castle.
        This weapon is yet another reference to Berserk, as they are often made in Miyazaki's previous Souls games.
        "Logarius and his band of executioners" bear many similarities to Mozgus, an insanely devout man who traveled the land torturing heretics along with his disciples.
        The wheel in particular was wielded by one of his six disciples, .
        In Dark Souls, Bonewheel Skeletons are another reference to Mozgus' disciples.
        In real life, although wheels weren't typically wielded as weapons, they were commonly used as torture devices, especially during the Middle Ages.
        Torture wheels were nicknamed "breaking wheels," since victims often times would have their limbs broken during the process.
        They were also known as "catherine wheels."
         It's quite possible that Logarius' Wheel also takes some inspiration in its use as a weapon from the English folklore legend of Tom Hickathrift. Tom was a fabled giant killer who made use of a cartwheel to vanquish the Wisbech Giant (also referred to as an ogre).
        Lore theories can be found under "From Berserk to Bloodborne".

        Ludwig's Holy Blade
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. It is said that the silver sword was employed by Ludwig, the first hunter of the church. When transformed, it combines with its sheath to form a greatsword. 
        It exhibits several departures from the workshop's design, suggesting that the Church anticipated much larger inhuman beasts."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased for 20,000 echoes from the Messengers after obtaining the Radiant Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon was wielded by Ludwig, a famous hunter of the Healing Church who designed the blade based on the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        According to the description, Ludwig wielded this sword in combat instead of the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        However, in his boss fight, he wields the Holy Moonlight Sword during a certain part in the fight.
        It is possible that Ludwig wielded the Holy Moonlight Sword and his fellow hunters, inspired by the huge weapon, sought to make replicas. Unable to make a magic sword, a huge metal sheath was the compromise.
        Before the DLC's release, Ludwig's Holy Blade was thought of as From Software's traditional "Moonlight Greatsword" seen throughout various games by the fanbase.
        However, this sword was eventually revealed in the DLC to be a replica of the "true" Moonlight Greatsword in Bloodborne, the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        This isn't the first time Miyazaki used the name of classical music composers in a game.
        A boss from the first "Dark Souls" game, Dragonslayer Ornstein, is named after Leo Ornstein.
        Berlioz from "Armored Core 4" is named after Hector Berlioz.
        The normal form of this weapon is very similar to the sword used for the Kirkhammer.
        However, this sword's normal form has a slightly longer reach when compared to the Kirkhammer's blade.
        The similar nature of these swords suggests that the Healing Church used the method of interchangeable parts to quickly mass produce weapons for their hunters.

        The Chikage isn't actually a katana - it is a katana/european sword hybrid. Its short crossguard resembles the one of an early viking sword, or the one of a xiphos (greek sword). The closest european crossguard shape with  this sword is the one of a Karabela (a polish sabre). In other hand, the  hilt and pommel resemble the ones of a longsword (a bit longer, to get easier katana traditional jutsu swings), while the blade shape and the 2-handed fighting style is very similar to a katana. A possible explanation for the origin of this hybrid is that the katana's design was imported to Cainhurst, where some modifications were made to create a sword similar to that commonly used by their knights.
        The Chikage is an allusion to a particular 'breed' of Katanas in the Souls games. While it is similar to both the Hiltless and Chaos Blade from Demon's Souls and Dark Souls respectively, the Chikage bears a stronger resemblance to the Magic Sword "Makoto" (also from Demon's Souls). The Makoto is the only one the bunch to actually DRAIN the user's HP over time, rather than decrease it with each successful swing.
        Chikage (ÂçÉÊôØ) literally means "Thousands Views", however if you separated the word into Chi Kage (Ë°ÄÂΩ±), it means "Blood Shadow". This could be correlated to the fact that Shadows Of Yharnam wield a similar katana with a slight  crossguard, however without using the bloodtinge.
        The transforming attack has the hunter sheathe the Chikage before unleashing a strike. This is a reference to Iaijutsu, a traditional Japanese sword technique that focuses on quick-drawing. At its finest, Iaijutse allows the warrior to unsheathe and strike at incredible speeds.
        The name seems to be a tribute to Chikage Yamamura (mentioned as a "special thanks" in credits)
        The name may also be a reference to the work "1000 Plateaus" by Giles Deluze and Felix Guattari, a famous philosophical essay about fluidity and functionality, maybe dirrectly tied to the esoteric nature of the weapons function.

        Rakuyo
        
        
        Hunter weapon wielded by Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower. 
        A trick sword originated in the same country as the Cainhurst Chikage, only this sword feeds not off blood, but instead demands great dexterity. 
        Lady Maria was fond of this aspect of the Rakuyo, as she frowned upon blood blades, despite being a distant relative of the queen. 
        One day, she abandoned her beloved Rakuyo, casting it into a dark well, when she could stomach it no longer."
        
        
        
        Fishing Hamlet. Get to the bottom of the well. Can be reached from the underground tunnels at the end of the area or via a ladder in the well right away. In that area a Shark Giant will wander around. Fighting him makes a second one appear after the first reaches sufficiently low health. The first giant will walk over near the ladder and scream at the ceiling, causing the second one to drop. The second one drops the weapon.
        Fighting the two of them can be difficult and it is a good idea to use the Shaman Bone Blade to make them fight each other and finish off the weaker one. Molotov cocktails are also very effective against them. If neither is available to you, try to kill the one with the anchor first, as it is significantly harder to dodge.
        One easy way to beat them is use of ranged weapon like Simon's Bowblade if you are a bloodtinge build, and the Holy Moonlight Sword if you are an arcane build.
        A Threaded Cane's transformed whip can easily hit the giants from the ledge once they're lured over and begin attacking, but be sure to keep your distance after each hit. Except that there is no way to lure them over the the ledge. No ranged weapon will hit the one standing at the back and the one hanging from the ceiling doesn't drop down until the first one is at 50% health. 
        Unlike other giants in the game, these ones are easy to gun parry for a visceral attack. Keep in mind this will get very tricky after the other one starts fighting, so try to separate them and time your viscerals to get the invincibility at the right moment.
        If your range is inadequate you can use the monocular to angle a throwing knife to be able to hit the shark giant in the back. This way, you can continue from the strategy of killing them on the ledge with a gun/magic without going around. (confirmed as of January 19th, 2019)
        Chaining together backstabs is a very effecient way of dealing with them, if played right you should be able to eliminate the first shark giant before the second reaches you this way. It is extremely difficult to get behind the patrolling Shark Giant without him detecting you.

        Reiterpallasch
        
        
        Weapon wielded by the Knights of Cainhurst. 
        Combines an elegant knight's sword with the peculiar firearm wielded by the Cainhurst order. 
        The old nobles, long-time imbibers of blood, are no strangers to the sanguine plague, and the disposal of beasts was a discrete task left to their servants, or knights, as they were called for the sake of appearances."
        
        
        
        It's found in a chest located in the entrance hall of Cainhurst Castle, where the Bound Widows are first encountered. When you first enter the room from the main entrance, run towards your two o'clock. The chest will be found in a corner.
        
        
        
        The Reiterpallasch (from German Reiter "horseback rider" and hungarian pallos [Ààp…ílo É] "sword") is a 17th century Hungarian straight sword with a typically double edged blade and guarded hilt that was used by Hungarian noble cavalry and later adapted by most western European armies.
        As pointed out in its description, the rifle spear is made "possibly in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon" (i.e. this one).
        Wynne D. Fanchon from Armored Core: For Answer; another From Software title, pilots a NEXT named Reiterpallasch.

        Rifle Spear
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. A prototype weapon serving as a simple firearm and spear, possibly created in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon. Lacks any notable functions, saving that it is the only trick weapon with an attached gun. "
        
        
        
        It can be found inside a hidden building in Old Yharnam. From the area you fight the first NPC Hunter (who wields a saw spear), drop down where the railing is missing in a corner and land on the ledges below. Go into the building and follow the stairs up; eventually you can find it stashed on a corpse tucked away in a hidden nook as you advance.
        Bought from the messengers for 4000 blood echoes after acquiring the Powder Keg Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        According to the Rifle Spear's description, it was designed as an imitation of "a lost Cainhurst weapon".
        That particular weapon may or may not be the Reiterpallasch.
        It should be noted these two weapons are the only two skill/firearm hybrids whose alternate forms utilize guns.
        The third skill/firearm hybrid weapon in this game is Simon's Bowblade, which transforms from a sword into a bow.
        The Rifle Spear is carried by a Yahar'Gul Hunter in the Cathedral Ward.
        This fight can be tricky because you first encounter a Yahar'Gul Hunter that uses a Tonitrus near the base of the stairs, and if you advance too far towards the houses, the Rifle Spear Yahar'Gul Hunter will join the fight as well.
        He also uses Ludwig's Rifle, meaning he can hit you from a considerable distance with shotgun pellets no matter what mode he uses for the Rifle Spear.

        Saw Cleaver
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used in the hunting business. 
        This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts, transforms into a long cleaver that makes use of centrifugal force. 
        The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness the more grotesquely transformed the beast."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired as a gift from the Messengers the first time you visit the Hunter's Dream.
        If you don't select it, you may buy it after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne.)
        
        
        
        The Saw Cleaver is the Trick Weapon featured on the title screen.
        It was also one of the first weapons to be revealed for this game.
        Overall the mechanisms of this weapon didn't change at all, starting all the way back when Bloodborne was still known as "Project Beast."
        According to the concept art, the Saw Cleaver uses a trigger mechanism to unlock the joint during transformation.
        The design of the Saw Cleaver seems to be inspired by multiple references:
        The transformed cleaver shows a resemblance to LB-66 MOONLIGHT from Armored Core V.
        The Japanese name is written as "nokogiri nata" („Éé„Ç≥„ÇÆ„É™Èâà) or "saw hatchet". Nokogiri is a traditional Japanese saw that cuts from the pull stroke, as opposed to the more common push stroke.
        In real life, there is a type of cleaver known as a mezzaluna ("half moon") cleaver, known for chopping/mincing up various food products.
        Most of these types of cleavers have handles on both ends.
        However, some use a single handle that stretches across the blade, which was used to chop up herbs usually; the saw cleaver follows this particular model.
        Coincidentally, the Strength/Skill/Arcane scaling at maximum level is "CDC" in their respective order.
        The CDC is an American organization designed to combat and prevent "health threats" of varying natures.
        Since the beast scourge acts like a plague (and is spread due to blood-related reasons), those who wield the Saw Cleaver can be thought of as fighting a dangerous epidemic.
        Henryk uses this weapon when he fights you and Eileen the Crow during her questline, as well as when he is summoned by you when using the Old Hunter Bell.

        Chikage
        
        
        Foreign-made weapon wielded by the royal guards who protect Annalise, Queen of the Vilebloods at Cainhurst Castle. 
        When the intricate, rippled engraving that spans the Chikage's blade is imbrued with blood, the sword sings in scarlet hues. 
        However, the rite eats away at the wielder's very essence."
        
        
        
        Join the Cainhurst Vilebloods covenant available at Cainhurst Castle, and then purchase from the Messengers for 50,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Chikage isn't actually a katana - it is a katana/european sword hybrid. Its short crossguard resembles the one of an early viking sword, or the one of a xiphos (greek sword). The closest european crossguard shape with  this sword is the one of a Karabela (a polish sabre). In other hand, the  hilt and pommel resemble the ones of a longsword (a bit longer, to get easier katana traditional jutsu swings), while the blade shape and the 2-handed fighting style is very similar to a katana. A possible explanation for the origin of this hybrid is that the katana's design was imported to Cainhurst, where some modifications were made to create a sword similar to that commonly used by their knights.
        The Chikage is an allusion to a particular 'breed' of Katanas in the Souls games. While it is similar to both the Hiltless and Chaos Blade from Demon's Souls and Dark Souls respectively, the Chikage bears a stronger resemblance to the Magic Sword "Makoto" (also from Demon's Souls). The Makoto is the only one the bunch to actually DRAIN the user's HP over time, rather than decrease it with each successful swing.
        Chikage (ÂçÉÊôØ) literally means "Thousands Views", however if you separated the word into Chi Kage (Ë°ÄÂΩ±), it means "Blood Shadow". This could be correlated to the fact that Shadows Of Yharnam wield a similar katana with a slight  crossguard, however without using the bloodtinge.
        The transforming attack has the hunter sheathe the Chikage before unleashing a strike. This is a reference to Iaijutsu, a traditional Japanese sword technique that focuses on quick-drawing. At its finest, Iaijutse allows the warrior to unsheathe and strike at incredible speeds.
        The name seems to be a tribute to Chikage Yamamura (mentioned as a "special thanks" in credits)
        The name may also be a reference to the work "1000 Plateaus" by Giles Deluze and Felix Guattari, a famous philosophical essay about fluidity and functionality, maybe dirrectly tied to the esoteric nature of the weapons function.

        Stake Driver
        
        
        A trick weapon fashioned by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. Favored by the retired hunter Djura. 
        The stake driver, with its queerly complex design, violently drives thick stakes into the flesh of foes. 
        The stake driver allows for high-damage critical attacks, but is difficult to use and leaves its wielder wide open, but none of this should bother a mere Powder Keg."
        
        
        
        Obtain Powder Keg Hunter Badge to unlock for purchase at the Messengers for 8,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Stake Driver is exclusively wielded by Djura when he is still hostile towards you.
        His fight is tricky because the area around him is very limited, meaning you can fall to your death if you're not careful.
        Furthermore, the limited space is perfect for his choice of weapon which has a short range.
        This is modeled after the "Pile Bunker," a type of fictional weaponry which launches piston with gunpowder or explosion.
        In the Japanese version of Bloodborne, this weapon is literally called the Pile Hammer („Éë„Ç§„É´„Éè„É≥„Éû„Éº).
        It bears a striking resemblance to the "Parrying Blade" weapons seen in several "Armored Core" games.
        Has the highest charged attack multiplier out of any other weapon.

        Threaded Cane
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used by hunters on their duties. Sufficiently deadly as a rigid bladed cane, but also serves as a whip when its blade is split into many. Concealing the weapon inside the cane and flogging the beasts with the whip is partly an act of ceremony, an attempt to demonstrate to oneself that the bloodlust of the hunt will never encroach upon the soul."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired at the beginning of the game as a gift from the Messengers.
        If not selected, it is later available for purchase from the blood fountain messengers after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne).
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is used by Iosefka, Last Scholar Yurie and the Frontier Church Hunter.
        Gehrman carries a generic cane in the Workshop instead of the Threaded Cane.
        This trick weapon is possibly inspired by the sword used by Jean-Fran√ßois de Morangias in the climactic battle of French action-horror film Brotherhood of the Wolf (which bears many other similarities to Bloodborne), or the sword used by a bandit leader in the anime/manga series Claymore. Both these weapons act as a straight, double-edged sword that can transform into a segmented, bladed whip.

        Tonitrus
        
        
        "A unique trick weapon contrived by Archibald, the infamous eccentric of the Healing Church workshop. 
        Striking this peculiar iron morning star flail like a match generates the same blue sparks that blanket a darkbeast. 
        Unfortunately, for reasons untold, the hunters of Archibald's time did not fully take to the device."
        
        
        
        Acquire the Spark Hunter Badge by defeating Darkbeast Paarl  to purchase from Messengers.
        Treasure: Yahar'gul, Unseen Village, at the top end of the road. (guarded by 2 Tainted Dogs and a Snatcher during daytime)
        
        
        
        Tonitrus is a Latin word meaning "thunder."
        The in-game description classifies this trick weapon as a morning star flail, but it's actually modeled in the form of a mace.
        The description of Archibald bears many similarities to Nikola Tesla, a famed inventor in real life who specialized in the field of electricity.
        Nikola Tesla created the Tesla Coil, a device that also bears many similarities to the Tonitrus.
        The Tonitrus also bears similarities with the aspergillum, a device used by the Roman Catholic Church to sprinkle holy water.
        According to the description of the Spark Hunter Badge, Archibald was associated with the Healing Church.
        In this sense, it may have been designed under the themes of "purificiation" and "cleansing" that is associated with many Healing Church trick weapons/tools.
        However, due to Archibald's fascination with Dark Beasts, it's more likely he designed the Tonitrus as a measure to replicate the sparks these creatures could unleash.

        Whirligig Saw
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs, and weapon of choice of the Old Hunter Valtr, the Beast Eater. 
        This weapon pummels beasts in its mace form, but its true strength lies in its attached mechanical saws. 
        These discs, lined with serrated teeth,spin rapidly, thrashing the flesh of beasts into fine shreds."
        
        
        
        From the Nightmare Church go down the stairs and follow the path. Drop down into the pools of blood of follow the path further until you reach the Cannon Executioner. Follow the left wall and turn down the path, the weapon is at the end.
        
        
        
        If you use the L2 buzzsaw attack against Orphan of Kos and hold it in place, it attempts to make an immediate counterattack for each time it gets hit by the whirring blades, only to get interrupted by the next hit. It shrieks every time it attacks, so as a result, it lets loose dozens of overlapping shriek sound effects for as long as you hold it in place.
        A whirligig is defined as a toy that is constantly spinning, such as a top or pinwheel, or as something regarded as hectic and constantly changing.
        Similar to most Powder Keg weapons sharing homage to Armored Core weapons, the Whirligig Saw is based on the Grind Blade.
        
    

        Church Pick
        
        
        One of the old trick weapons of the Healing Church, a hunting weapon formed from one of the giant picks that appear in old beast tales. 
        The Church Pick initially serves as a large sword, but when transformed functions as an extended war pick. In spite of its origins, it is a highly practical weapon."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Dropped by a hunter wearing Yahar'Gul set (presumably, this is the summonable Old Hunter Defector Antal) in one of the cells that you open with the Underground Cell Key from the Research Hall. To make this battle simple, attack him through the door with a strong R2 attack, then leave the room. He will lose sight of you and his AI will return to a standstill behind the door. Rinse and repeat until dead.
        
        
        
        The Church Pick And The Hunter's Axe both have similar appearance. When transformed, both are wielded as a polearm and have the same de-transformation attack. The only difference apart from the Church Pick having a slightly more complicated mechanism is that the Hunter's Axe is a strength-based weapon.
        A few of its attacks in the transformed mode are very similar to that of the Burial Blade.

        Amygdalan Arm 
        
        
        The arm of a small Amygdala Great One. 
        Strictly speaking, the Amygdalan Arm is no trick weapon of any sort, but certain madmen wield them like clubs. 
        Starts as a large, tough blunt weapon formed of bone, but when extended, the hand quivers as if it were still alive.
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare, cave at the end of the blood river to the right after getting out of the building that used to be the shortcut to the Cleric Beast in the main game. Gatling Gun Hunter dropping the Gatling Gun and a Blood-Starved Beast can be also found here. Arm is near the Blood-Starved Beast at the end of the cave.
        
        
        
        The Amygdalan Arm is a Trick Weapon in name only, considering that it is an arm obtained from Amygdala.
        The arm is remarkably small, as even the Lesser Amygdalae are huge. Perhaps it came from a newborn Amygdala.
        The arm could be the inspiration behind the Burial Blade.

        Crafted by chiseling the long bones of an undead darkbeast and fastening them to the weapon. The bones are still alive, and when unleashed, grant its wielder a spurt of beastly power. 
        As flesh is flayed and blood is sprayed, the beast within awakens, and in time, the wielder of this weapon surges with both strength and feverish reverie."

        Can be bought from messengers for 34000 echoes after acquisition.
        Can be bought from messengers after co-operation with player who has them. This only occurs in Hunter's dream before fight with Gehrman or Moon Presence. It is not needed to complete any Chalice Dungeons. It is unknown if this is glitch or intentional. Was patched by 1.07 or 1.08.
        
        
        
        When this weapon is equipped, your gloves will be replaced by two bone gauntlets. This can allow for the lost art of rapid glove changing if you switch your weapons really fast.
        You can charge the beasthood meter on the first windows (Gilbert) of Central Yharnam
        In the past, there was a rare glitch that allowed a player to obtain this weapon without finding it in the Chalice Dungeons.
        It has since been patched, although it isn't quite known when it was successfully patched.

        A second blade is found inside the curve of the main one. In its initial form, the saif can be wielded like a long curved sword, but when transformed, its blade is contracted, allowing for quick, repeated stabs. 
        Although this trick weapon allows for adaptive combat, it was later replaced by saws and similar weapons that were more effective at disposing of beasts."

        Beast Cutter
        
        
        A trick weapon used by Old Hunters. 
        This thick iron cleaver slices through the toughest of beast hides, and when transformed the blade splits into sections, allowing one to lash it in the fashion of a heavy whip. 
        This crude weapon relies on brute force and is regrettably inelegant, suggesting that the hunts of the earliest hunters made for horrific affairs, painted in sanguine black and reds."
        
        
        
        When walking up the stairs to the nightmare version of the Grand Cathedral, turn left onto a small platform, then roll off and walk down some rough terrain to find the weapon on a corpse.
        
        
        
        Reminds many of the Zanpakut≈ç , a fictional segmented sword that can function as a whip. It is an iconic weapon from the Bleach anime.
        The untransformed form of the weapon is a cleaver-like serrated club, and it really looks like the samoan war club "Nifo Oti".

        Blade of mercy
        
        
        A special trick weapon passed down among hunters of hunters. One of the oldest weapons of the workshop. 
        Splits into two when activated. The weapon's warped blades are forged with siderite, a rare mineral of the heavens. Most effective swift attacks,such as after a quick-stepping."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers for 40000 echoes after obtaining the Crow Hunter Badge from Eileen the Crow's quest line.
        Killing Eileen is also a way to get the weapon early in the game.
        While progressing through Eileen's quest, it's possible for her to be killed by Henryk and thus drop the Crow Hunter Badge as a result, although the quest line will end.
        
        
        
        The Blade of Mercy was originally named as "Warped Twinblades" during the Alpha test, and it was the tool of choice for the "agile" hunter.
        Both the Burial Blade and Blade of Mercy make mentions of a mineral known as siderite in their descriptions.
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite, and it seems to be the reason why arcane power has direct scaling with both blade's damage output. Due to its extraterrestrial origins, that may explain why it cannot be buffed by an external source of any sort.
        It loosely resembles the Eleum Loyce from Dark Souls 2, a sword with two blades at the front.

        Bloodletter
        
        
        The demented hunter weapon brandished by Brador, the Healing Church assassin. 
        The Bloodletter assumes its true and terrifying form after it draws upon blood from the inner reaches of one's body and soul. 
        This is the only effective means of expelling tainted blood, or so Brador, isolated in his cell, continued to believe."
        
        
        
        Obtain the underground cell inner chamber key.
        Return to the underground prison (from the underground corpse pile lamp, go up the stairs and turn left) and open the door to Brador's cell. His cell is the second on the left behind a flight of downward stairs. Kill Brador to obtain the bloodletter.
        Brador will not be hostile in his cell, but will invade the player right outside his cell.

        Boom Hammer
        
        
        A trick weapon used by the old hunters, and crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. 
        A giant hammer equipped with a miniature furnace. When ignited and fired, it emits a volley of flame that explodes furiously upon impact. 
        Crush the beasts, then burn them - the brute simplicity of the Boom Hammer was favored by hunters with an acute distaste for beasts."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare. Inside a house that looks out of Central Yharnam, the same that is the shortcut to the cleric beast in the main game, where the 10 quicksilver bullets used to be. Be sure to shoot the explosives around the item (or act fast), as the wheelchair huntsman's corpse conceals a delayed molotov set to trigger when you try to grab the Boom Hammer, potential killing you in a huge blast.

        Burial Blade
        
        
        Trick weapon wielded by Gehrman, the first hunter." 
        A masterpiece that defined the entire array of weapons crafted at the workshop. Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens. 
        Gehrman surely saw the hunt as a dirge of farewell, wishing only that his prey might rest in peace, never again to awaken to another harrowing nightmare. "
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 60,000 Blood Echoes after defeating Gehrman, the First Hunter and acquiring the Old Hunter Badge from him.
        To make Gehrman fight you, the "Refuse" option must be selected.
        If one accepts his proposal, the game will outright end there and it will be impossible to obtain this weapon in that playthrough (not including the uncanny/lost forms found in the chalice dungeons).
        Normally, the Burial Blade can only be obtained in NG+ and beyond. However, one can bypass this by using Bold Hunter's Mark, or being killed, during The Moon Presence boss battle.
        
        
        
         The Burial Blade was the first trick weapon ever created, and it inspired others to develop new trick weapons, usually on the premise of adapting to different combat scenerios.
        Not all weapons adapt to different combat scenerios (e.g. Tonitrus), but the Burial Blade still inspired an entire series of weapons that could "transform" to satisfy different purposes.
        It was created, and exclusively wielded, by Gehrman.
        A Burial Blade can be found above the workshop table in the Hunter's Dream.
        The weapon's description mentions that "Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens."
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite. Due to its extraterrestrial nature, it could be the reason why it has direct scaling with arcane and cannot be tampered by external sources.
        Both the Burial Blade and the Blade of Mercy mentions the use of it in their descriptions.
        Interestingly enough, these two weapons also resemble the talons of Mergo's Wet Nurse.
        The shape of the scythe highly resembles Rurufon's scythe from Shadow Tower Abyss, an early title created by From Software as well as being recurring weapons in Souls series.
        A strange bug on rare occurrences the cape on the hunter may come off, usually in a boss fight you could notice if you dodge back and do an R1 combo the cape disappears. [Note, I haven't seen this happen in a while, it's possible that it may have been fixed, but I'll need confirmation on this]

        Chikage
        
        
        Foreign-made weapon wielded by the royal guards who protect Annalise, Queen of the Vilebloods at Cainhurst Castle. 
        When the intricate, rippled engraving that spans the Chikage's blade is imbrued with blood, the sword sings in scarlet hues. 
        However, the rite eats away at the wielder's very essence."
        
        
        
        Join the Cainhurst Vilebloods covenant available at Cainhurst Castle, and then purchase from the Messengers for 50,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Chikage isn't actually a katana - it is a katana/european sword hybrid. Its short crossguard resembles the one of an early viking sword, or the one of a xiphos (greek sword). The closest european crossguard shape with  this sword is the one of a Karabela (a polish sabre). In other hand, the  hilt and pommel resemble the ones of a longsword (a bit longer, to get easier katana traditional jutsu swings), while the blade shape and the 2-handed fighting style is very similar to a katana. A possible explanation for the origin of this hybrid is that the katana's design was imported to Cainhurst, where some modifications were made to create a sword similar to that commonly used by their knights.
        The Chikage is an allusion to a particular 'breed' of Katanas in the Souls games. While it is similar to both the Hiltless and Chaos Blade from Demon's Souls and Dark Souls respectively, the Chikage bears a stronger resemblance to the Magic Sword "Makoto" (also from Demon's Souls). The Makoto is the only one the bunch to actually DRAIN the user's HP over time, rather than decrease it with each successful swing.
        Chikage (ÂçÉÊôØ) literally means "Thousands Views", however if you separated the word into Chi Kage (Ë°ÄÂΩ±), it means "Blood Shadow". This could be correlated to the fact that Shadows Of Yharnam wield a similar katana with a slight  crossguard, however without using the bloodtinge.
        The transforming attack has the hunter sheathe the Chikage before unleashing a strike. This is a reference to Iaijutsu, a traditional Japanese sword technique that focuses on quick-drawing. At its finest, Iaijutse allows the warrior to unsheathe and strike at incredible speeds.
        The name seems to be a tribute to Chikage Yamamura (mentioned as a "special thanks" in credits)
        The name may also be a reference to the work "1000 Plateaus" by Giles Deluze and Felix Guattari, a famous philosophical essay about fluidity and functionality, maybe dirrectly tied to the esoteric nature of the weapons function.

        Holy Moonlight Sword
        
        
        An arcane sword discovered long ago by Ludwig. 
        When blue moonlight dances around the sword, and it channels the abyssal cosmos, its great blade will hurl a shadowy lightwave. 
        The Holy Moonlight Sword is synonymous with Ludwig, the Holy Blade, but few have ever set eyes on the great blade, and whatever guidance it has to offer, it seems to be of a very private, elusive sort."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Found on the Underground Corpse Pile after the fight against Ludwig, The Holy Blade. Ludwig's head will be lying there and you can:
        Kill the head for the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and talk to the head. When prompted, reply "Yes" and you'll get the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and reply "No", then come back later and Simon the Harrowed will be there and give you the sword.
        NOTE: This weapon is missable. If Lawrence is killed before you obtain it, you will no longer be able to talk to the head or obtain it from Simon.
        
        
        
        It seems to be another reappearance of the Moonlight Greatsword, a recurring item found around FromSoftware's games. Notable examples of such games include the first, second and third Dark Souls games, Demon's Souls, King's Field, Ninja Blade, Enchanted Arms, Armored Core, 3D Dot Game Heroes, and Otogi.

        Hunter Axe
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used on the hunt. Retains the qualities of an axe, but offers a wider palette of attacks by transforming. Boasts a heavy blunt attack, leading to high rally potential. No matter their pasts, beasts are no more than beasts. Some choose this axe to play the part of executioner."
        
        
        
        It's possible to pick this trick weapon as a starting weapon near the beginning of Bloodborne.
        If not chosen, it can instead be purchased from the Messengers after the Hunter has found the Saw Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is wielded by Father Gascoigne.
        However, he has a moveset that is different from the Hunter's version.
        He is also capable of using his unique Hunter Pistol even while his Hunter Axe is transformed, which is impossible for the Hunter to do.
        It's also wielded by the Madara's Twin who drops Madara's Whistle when defeated.
        Another hostile hunter NPC wields this trick weapon in the Nightmare Frontier.
        It's been heavily debated by the fanbase whether the transformed mode is a halberd or poleaxe.
        Both forms utilized axe heads with a spear tip at the end (although some poleaxes used hammer heads instead).
        However, neither weapon was known to have extendable handles, which is a special trademark of the Hunter Axe.
        In either case, it's possible this trick weapon was inspired by both weapons and simply incorporated many different designs.

        Kirkhammer
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. On the one side, an easily handled silver sword. On the other, a giant obtuse stone weapon, characterized by a blunt strike and extreme force of impact. The Church takes a heavy-handed, merciless stance toward the plague of beasts, an irony not lost upon the wielders of this most symbolic weapon."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers after acquiring the Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        A miniature of the Kirkhammer was included as the Pre-Order Bonus for Asian editions of Bloodborne. [See the Bundles page for details]
        A "kirk" is an archaic old english word meaning "church."
        This means the weapon is literately known as the Church Hammer.
        The wording also might be a nod to Nordic culture since the word "Kirk" originated from northern England and Old Norse wording.
        The etched wording on the side of the hammer part has similarities to the Old Norse alphabet.
        However, it also has similarities to the Elder Futhark, one of the oldest forms of the runic alphabet system used by Germanic tribes.
        Similar etchings can be found on gravestones all over Yharnam.
        The sword used for this weapon is very similar to the one used for Ludwig's Holy Blade.
        This suggests that the Healing Church used the method of "interchangeable parts" to efficiently mass produce weapons for their hunters.
        However, the sword used for the Kirkhammer is shorter.
        It's wielded by Alfred, should you choose to be friends with him.
        He uses this weapon as a summon.
        However, he wields the Logarius' Wheel if you find him in Cainhurst Castle under special circumstances.
        When untransformed, with the hammer part on the character's back, some cloth parts (capes etc.) of the armor can either get awkwardly stuck on it or cover it.
        Despite being labeled a 'stone weapon', the etchings, wear, and sound produced when it strikes indicate that the hammer is in fact made of metal.

        Kos Parasite
        
        
        When the carcass of Kos washed up on the coast, its insides were teeming with tiny parasites, unlike any found in humans. 
        This atypical weapon can only be clasped tight and swung, but a Kos Parasite is said to stimulate phantasms inhabiting a lumenwood"
        
        
        
        Dropped by Orphan of Kos
        
        
        
        The Kos Parasite is perhaps the most interestingly unique weapon in Bloodborne in various ways: It is one of two weapons that can reach it's full potential while using a rune (the other being Beast Claw), the weapon itself is not held, it is purely an arcane weapon, it is the only weapon directly dropped by defeating a boss, it has the highest durability of any weapon at 600 respectively, it is the only weapon to have an A-scaling of any weapon without any upgrades and is the only weapon to have an S-scaling by upgrading it twice.

        Logarius's Wheel
        
        
        "Weapon wielded by martyr Logarius' band of executioners. 
        Used to slaughter the Vilebloods in Cainhurst. Bathed in pools of their blood, and forever steeped in their ire. 
        Transform to release the power of the wheel and manifest their lingering rage in a show of utter brilliance."
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 13,000 Blood Echoes after acquiring the Wheel Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        Alfred utilizes the Logarius' Wheel when found in Cainhurst Castle.
        This weapon is yet another reference to Berserk, as they are often made in Miyazaki's previous Souls games.
        "Logarius and his band of executioners" bear many similarities to Mozgus, an insanely devout man who traveled the land torturing heretics along with his disciples.
        The wheel in particular was wielded by one of his six disciples, .
        In Dark Souls, Bonewheel Skeletons are another reference to Mozgus' disciples.
        In real life, although wheels weren't typically wielded as weapons, they were commonly used as torture devices, especially during the Middle Ages.
        Torture wheels were nicknamed "breaking wheels," since victims often times would have their limbs broken during the process.
        They were also known as "catherine wheels."
         It's quite possible that Logarius' Wheel also takes some inspiration in its use as a weapon from the English folklore legend of Tom Hickathrift. Tom was a fabled giant killer who made use of a cartwheel to vanquish the Wisbech Giant (also referred to as an ogre).
        Lore theories can be found under "From Berserk to Bloodborne".

        Ludwig's Holy Blade
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. It is said that the silver sword was employed by Ludwig, the first hunter of the church. When transformed, it combines with its sheath to form a greatsword. 
        It exhibits several departures from the workshop's design, suggesting that the Church anticipated much larger inhuman beasts."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased for 20,000 echoes from the Messengers after obtaining the Radiant Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon was wielded by Ludwig, a famous hunter of the Healing Church who designed the blade based on the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        According to the description, Ludwig wielded this sword in combat instead of the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        However, in his boss fight, he wields the Holy Moonlight Sword during a certain part in the fight.
        It is possible that Ludwig wielded the Holy Moonlight Sword and his fellow hunters, inspired by the huge weapon, sought to make replicas. Unable to make a magic sword, a huge metal sheath was the compromise.
        Before the DLC's release, Ludwig's Holy Blade was thought of as From Software's traditional "Moonlight Greatsword" seen throughout various games by the fanbase.
        However, this sword was eventually revealed in the DLC to be a replica of the "true" Moonlight Greatsword in Bloodborne, the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        This isn't the first time Miyazaki used the name of classical music composers in a game.
        A boss from the first "Dark Souls" game, Dragonslayer Ornstein, is named after Leo Ornstein.
        Berlioz from "Armored Core 4" is named after Hector Berlioz.
        The normal form of this weapon is very similar to the sword used for the Kirkhammer.
        However, this sword's normal form has a slightly longer reach when compared to the Kirkhammer's blade.
        The similar nature of these swords suggests that the Healing Church used the method of interchangeable parts to quickly mass produce weapons for their hunters.
        Lore theories exist under Ebrietas Lore.

        Rakuyo
        
        
        Hunter weapon wielded by Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower. 
        A trick sword originated in the same country as the Cainhurst Chikage, only this sword feeds not off blood, but instead demands great dexterity. 
        Lady Maria was fond of this aspect of the Rakuyo, as she frowned upon blood blades, despite being a distant relative of the queen. 
        One day, she abandoned her beloved Rakuyo, casting it into a dark well, when she could stomach it no longer."
        
        
        
        Fishing Hamlet. Get to the bottom of the well. Can be reached from the underground tunnels at the end of the area or via a ladder in the well right away. In that area a Shark Giant will wander around. Fighting him makes a second one appear after the first reaches sufficiently low health. The first giant will walk over near the ladder and scream at the ceiling, causing the second one to drop. The second one drops the weapon.
        Fighting the two of them can be difficult and it is a good idea to use the Shaman Bone Blade to make them fight each other and finish off the weaker one. Molotov cocktails are also very effective against them. If neither is available to you, try to kill the one with the anchor first, as it is significantly harder to dodge.
        One easy way to beat them is use of ranged weapon like Simon's Bowblade if you are a bloodtinge build, and the Holy Moonlight Sword if you are an arcane build.
        A Threaded Cane's transformed whip can easily hit the giants from the ledge once they're lured over and begin attacking, but be sure to keep your distance after each hit. Except that there is no way to lure them over the the ledge. No ranged weapon will hit the one standing at the back and the one hanging from the ceiling doesn't drop down until the first one is at 50% health. 
        Unlike other giants in the game, these ones are easy to gun parry for a visceral attack. Keep in mind this will get very tricky after the other one starts fighting, so try to separate them and time your viscerals to get the invincibility at the right moment.
        If your range is inadequate you can use the monocular to angle a throwing knife to be able to hit the shark giant in the back. This way, you can continue from the strategy of killing them on the ledge with a gun/magic without going around. (confirmed as of January 19th, 2019)
        Chaining together backstabs is a very effecient way of dealing with them, if played right you should be able to eliminate the first shark giant before the second reaches you this way. It is extremely difficult to get behind the patrolling Shark Giant without him detecting you. 
        For a video showing an easy way to kill the sharks with a monocular and a throwing knife strategy, check .
        
        
        
        Rakuyo (ËêΩËëâ) literally means "falling leaf".
        The sword of Rakuyo bears resemblance to the "ky≈´ gunt≈ç", which was a hybrid of the sabre/katana with a handguard, used during the Russo-Japanese War.

        Reiterpallasch
        
        
        Weapon wielded by the Knights of Cainhurst. 
        Combines an elegant knight's sword with the peculiar firearm wielded by the Cainhurst order. 
        The old nobles, long-time imbibers of blood, are no strangers to the sanguine plague, and the disposal of beasts was a discrete task left to their servants, or knights, as they were called for the sake of appearances."
        
        
        
        It's found in a chest located in the entrance hall of Cainhurst Castle, where the Bound Widows are first encountered. When you first enter the room from the main entrance, run towards your two o'clock. The chest will be found in a corner.
        
        
        
        The Reiterpallasch (from German Reiter "horseback rider" and hungarian pallos [Ààp…ílo É] "sword") is a 17th century Hungarian straight sword with a typically double edged blade and guarded hilt that was used by Hungarian noble cavalry and later adapted by most western European armies.
        As pointed out in its description, the rifle spear is made "possibly in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon" (i.e. this one).
        Wynne D. Fanchon from Armored Core: For Answer; another From Software title, pilots a NEXT named Reiterpallasch.

        Rifle Spear
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. A prototype weapon serving as a simple firearm and spear, possibly created in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon. Lacks any notable functions, saving that it is the only trick weapon with an attached gun. "
        
        
        
        It can be found inside a hidden building in Old Yharnam. From the area you fight the first NPC Hunter (who wields a saw spear), drop down where the railing is missing in a corner and land on the ledges below. Go into the building and follow the stairs up; eventually you can find it stashed on a corpse tucked away in a hidden nook as you advance.
        Bought from the messengers for 4000 blood echoes after acquiring the Powder Keg Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        According to the Rifle Spear's description, it was designed as an imitation of "a lost Cainhurst weapon".
        That particular weapon may or may not be the Reiterpallasch.
        It should be noted these two weapons are the only two skill/firearm hybrids whose alternate forms utilize guns.
        The third skill/firearm hybrid weapon in this game is Simon's Bowblade, which transforms from a sword into a bow.
        The Rifle Spear is carried by a Yahar'Gul Hunter in the Cathedral Ward.
        This fight can be tricky because you first encounter a Yahar'Gul Hunter that uses a Tonitrus near the base of the stairs, and if you advance too far towards the houses, the Rifle Spear Yahar'Gul Hunter will join the fight as well.
        He also uses Ludwig's Rifle, meaning he can hit you from a considerable distance with shotgun pellets no matter what mode he uses for the Rifle Spear.

        Saw Cleaver
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used in the hunting business. 
        This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts, transforms into a long cleaver that makes use of centrifugal force. 
        The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness the more grotesquely transformed the beast."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired as a gift from the Messengers the first time you visit the Hunter's Dream.
        If you don't select it, you may buy it after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne.)
        
        
        
        The Saw Cleaver is the Trick Weapon featured on the title screen.
        It was also one of the first weapons to be revealed for this game.
        Overall the mechanisms of this weapon didn't change at all, starting all the way back when Bloodborne was still known as "Project Beast."
        According to the concept art, the Saw Cleaver uses a trigger mechanism to unlock the joint during transformation.
        The design of the Saw Cleaver seems to be inspired by multiple references:
        The transformed cleaver shows a resemblance to LB-66 MOONLIGHT from Armored Core V.
        The Japanese name is written as "nokogiri nata" („Éé„Ç≥„ÇÆ„É™Èâà) or "saw hatchet". Nokogiri is a traditional Japanese saw that cuts from the pull stroke, as opposed to the more common push stroke.
        In real life, there is a type of cleaver known as a mezzaluna ("half moon") cleaver, known for chopping/mincing up various food products.
        Most of these types of cleavers have handles on both ends.
        However, some use a single handle that stretches across the blade, which was used to chop up herbs usually; the saw cleaver follows this particular model.
        Coincidentally, the Strength/Skill/Arcane scaling at maximum level is "CDC" in their respective order.
        The CDC is an American organization designed to combat and prevent "health threats" of varying natures.
        Since the beast scourge acts like a plague (and is spread due to blood-related reasons), those who wield the Saw Cleaver can be thought of as fighting a dangerous epidemic.
        Henryk uses this weapon when he fights you and Eileen the Crow during her questline, as well as when he is summoned by you when using the Old Hunter Bell.
        
        
    

        Church Pick
        
        
        One of the old trick weapons of the Healing Church, a hunting weapon formed from one of the giant picks that appear in old beast tales. 
        The Church Pick initially serves as a large sword, but when transformed functions as an extended war pick. In spite of its origins, it is a highly practical weapon."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Dropped by a hunter wearing Yahar'Gul set (presumably, this is the summonable Old Hunter Defector Antal) in one of the cells that you open with the Underground Cell Key from the Research Hall. To make this battle simple, attack him through the door with a strong R2 attack, then leave the room. He will lose sight of you and his AI will return to a standstill behind the door. Rinse and repeat until dead.
        
        
        
        The Church Pick And The Hunter's Axe both have similar appearance. When transformed, both are wielded as a polearm and have the same de-transformation attack. The only difference apart from the Church Pick having a slightly more complicated mechanism is that the Hunter's Axe is a strength-based weapon.
        A few of its attacks in the transformed mode are very similar to that of the Burial Blade.

        Saw Spear
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used by those who dedicate themselves to the hunt. This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts, transforms into a medium-range spear. The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness the more grotesquely transformed the beast."
        
        
        
        Can be bought from the Bath Messengers, after obtaining the Saw Hunter Badge, for 1,000 Blood Echoes.
        Treasure in Central Yharnam Sewer, on the ledge above the dead end with boats. You also need to cut down the corpse hanging from the rafters high above.

        Simon's Bowblade
        
        
        Choice weapon of Simon, one of the first Healing Church hunters.
        Simon despised firearms, and so the Church workshop had this specially fashioned to his liking. The large curved blade serves as a bow when transformed.
        But aside from a few close friends, Simon was scoffed at for his choice of arms, for who would dare face the beasts with a measly bow?"
        
        
        
        Fishing Hamlet: Found on the body of Simon the Harrowed next to the Lighthouse Hut lantern after answering the first option at the Hunter's Nightmare shortcut and going through his quest-line. Interact with him as he lies on the ground to obtain the weapon.
        You may also kill Simon the Harrowed at The Hunter's Nightmare or Research Hall to obtain the weapon.
        
        
        
        Simon's Bowblade is the only weapon to have a S-scaling for two attributes (Skill and Bloodtinge respectively) when fully upgraded

        Stake Driver
        
        
        A trick weapon fashioned by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. Favored by the retired hunter Djura. 
        The stake driver, with its queerly complex design, violently drives thick stakes into the flesh of foes. 
        The stake driver allows for high-damage critical attacks, but is difficult to use and leaves its wielder wide open, but none of this should bother a mere Powder Keg."
        
        
        
        Obtain Powder Keg Hunter Badge to unlock for purchase at the Messengers for 8,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Stake Driver is exclusively wielded by Djura when he is still hostile towards you.
        His fight is tricky because the area around him is very limited, meaning you can fall to your death if you're not careful.
        Furthermore, the limited space is perfect for his choice of weapon which has a short range.
        This is modeled after the "Pile Bunker," a type of fictional weaponry which launches piston with gunpowder or explosion.
        In the Japanese version of Bloodborne, this weapon is literally called the Pile Hammer („Éë„Ç§„É´„Éè„É≥„Éû„Éº).
        It bears a striking resemblance to the "Parrying Blade" weapons seen in several "Armored Core" games.
        Has the highest charged attack multiplier out of any other weapon.

        Threaded Cane
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used by hunters on their duties. Sufficiently deadly as a rigid bladed cane, but also serves as a whip when its blade is split into many. Concealing the weapon inside the cane and flogging the beasts with the whip is partly an act of ceremony, an attempt to demonstrate to oneself that the bloodlust of the hunt will never encroach upon the soul."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired at the beginning of the game as a gift from the Messengers.
        If not selected, it is later available for purchase from the blood fountain messengers after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne).
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is used by Iosefka, Last Scholar Yurie and the Frontier Church Hunter.
        Gehrman carries a generic cane in the Workshop instead of the Threaded Cane.
        This trick weapon is possibly inspired by the sword used by Jean-Fran√ßois de Morangias in the climactic battle of French action-horror film Brotherhood of the Wolf (which bears many other similarities to Bloodborne), or the sword used by a bandit leader in the anime/manga series Claymore. Both these weapons act as a straight, double-edged sword that can transform into a segmented, bladed whip.

        Tonitrus
        
        
        "A unique trick weapon contrived by Archibald, the infamous eccentric of the Healing Church workshop. 
        Striking this peculiar iron morning star flail like a match generates the same blue sparks that blanket a darkbeast. 
        Unfortunately, for reasons untold, the hunters of Archibald's time did not fully take to the device."
        
        
        
        Acquire the Spark Hunter Badge by defeating Darkbeast Paarl  to purchase from Messengers.
        Treasure: Yahar'gul, Unseen Village, at the top end of the road. (guarded by 2 Tainted Dogs and a Snatcher during daytime)
        
        
        
        Tonitrus is a Latin word meaning "thunder."
        The in-game description classifies this trick weapon as a morning star flail, but it's actually modeled in the form of a mace.
        The description of Archibald bears many similarities to Nikola Tesla, a famed inventor in real life who specialized in the field of electricity.
        Nikola Tesla created the Tesla Coil, a device that also bears many similarities to the Tonitrus.
        The Tonitrus also bears similarities with the aspergillum, a device used by the Roman Catholic Church to sprinkle holy water.
        According to the description of the Spark Hunter Badge, Archibald was associated with the Healing Church.
        In this sense, it may have been designed under the themes of "purificiation" and "cleansing" that is associated with many Healing Church trick weapons/tools.
        However, due to Archibald's fascination with Dark Beasts, it's more likely he designed the Tonitrus as a measure to replicate the sparks these creatures could unleash.

        Whirligig Saw
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs, and weapon of choice of the Old Hunter Valtr, the Beast Eater. 
        This weapon pummels beasts in its mace form, but its true strength lies in its attached mechanical saws. 
        These discs, lined with serrated teeth,spin rapidly, thrashing the flesh of beasts into fine shreds."
        
        
        
        From the Nightmare Church go down the stairs and follow the path. Drop down into the pools of blood of follow the path further until you reach the Cannon Executioner. Follow the left wall and turn down the path, the weapon is at the end.
        
        
        
        If you use the L2 buzzsaw attack against Orphan of Kos and hold it in place, it attempts to make an immediate counterattack for each time it gets hit by the whirring blades, only to get interrupted by the next hit. It shrieks every time it attacks, so as a result, it lets loose dozens of overlapping shriek sound effects for as long as you hold it in place.
        A whirligig is defined as a toy that is constantly spinning, such as a top or pinwheel, or as something regarded as hectic and constantly changing.
        Similar to most Powder Keg weapons sharing homage to Armored Core weapons, the Whirligig Saw is based on the Grind Blade.
        
    

        Holy Moonlight Sword
        
        
        An arcane sword discovered long ago by Ludwig. 
        When blue moonlight dances around the sword, and it channels the abyssal cosmos, its great blade will hurl a shadowy lightwave. 
        The Holy Moonlight Sword is synonymous with Ludwig, the Holy Blade, but few have ever set eyes on the great blade, and whatever guidance it has to offer, it seems to be of a very private, elusive sort."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Found on the Underground Corpse Pile after the fight against Ludwig, The Holy Blade. Ludwig's head will be lying there and you can:
        Kill the head for the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and talk to the head. When prompted, reply "Yes" and you'll get the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and reply "No", then come back later and Simon the Harrowed will be there and give you the sword.
        NOTE: This weapon is missable. If Lawrence is killed before you obtain it, you will no longer be able to talk to the head or obtain it from Simon.
        
        
        
        It seems to be another reappearance of the Moonlight Greatsword, a recurring item found around FromSoftware's games.

        Amygdalan Arm 
        
        
        The arm of a small Amygdala Great One. 
        Strictly speaking, the Amygdalan Arm is no trick weapon of any sort, but certain madmen wield them like clubs. 
        Starts as a large, tough blunt weapon formed of bone, but when extended, the hand quivers as if it were still alive.
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare, cave at the end of the blood river to the right after getting out of the building that used to be the shortcut to the Cleric Beast in the main game. Gatling Gun Hunter dropping the Gatling Gun and a Blood-Starved Beast can be also found here. Arm is near the Blood-Starved Beast at the end of the cave.
        
        
        
        The Amygdalan Arm is a Trick Weapon in name only, considering that it is an arm obtained from Amygdala.
        The arm is remarkably small, as even the Lesser Amygdalae are huge. Perhaps it came from a newborn Amygdala.
        The arm could be the inspiration behind the Burial Blade.

        Crafted by chiseling the long bones of an undead darkbeast and fastening them to the weapon. The bones are still alive, and when unleashed, grant its wielder a spurt of beastly power. 
        As flesh is flayed and blood is sprayed, the beast within awakens, and in time, the wielder of this weapon surges with both strength and feverish reverie."

        Can be bought from messengers for 34000 echoes after acquisition.
        Can be bought from messengers after co-operation with player who has them. This only occurs in Hunter's dream before fight with Gehrman or Moon Presence. It is not needed to complete any Chalice Dungeons. It is unknown if this is glitch or intentional. Was patched by 1.07 or 1.08.
        
        
        
        When this weapon is equipped, your gloves will be replaced by two bone gauntlets. This can allow for the lost art of rapid glove changing if you switch your weapons really fast.
        You can charge the beasthood meter on the first windows (Gilbert) of Central Yharnam
        In the past, there was a rare glitch that allowed a player to obtain this weapon without finding it in the Chalice Dungeons.
        It has since been patched, although it isn't quite known when it was successfully patched.

        Although this trick weapon allows for adaptive combat, it was later replaced by saws and similar weapons that were more effective at disposing of beasts."

        Beast Cutter
        
        
        A trick weapon used by Old Hunters. 
        This thick iron cleaver slices through the toughest of beast hides, and when transformed the blade splits into sections, allowing one to lash it in the fashion of a heavy whip. 
        This crude weapon relies on brute force and is regrettably inelegant, suggesting that the hunts of the earliest hunters made for horrific affairs, painted in sanguine black and reds."
        
        
        
        When walking up the stairs to the nightmare version of the Grand Cathedral, turn left onto a small platform, then roll off and walk down some rough terrain to find the weapon on a corpse.
        
        
        
        Reminds many of the Zanpakut≈ç , a fictional segmented sword that can function as a whip. It is an iconic weapon from the Bleach anime.
        The untransformed form of the weapon is a cleaver-like serrated club, and it really looks like the samoan war club "Nifo Oti".

        Blade of mercy
        
        
        A special trick weapon passed down among hunters of hunters. One of the oldest weapons of the workshop. 
        Splits into two when activated. The weapon's warped blades are forged with siderite, a rare mineral of the heavens. Most effective swift attacks,such as after a quick-stepping."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers for 40000 echoes after obtaining the Crow Hunter Badge from Eileen the Crow's quest line.
        Killing Eileen is also a way to get the weapon early in the game.
        While progressing through Eileen's quest, it's possible for her to be killed by Henryk and thus drop the Crow Hunter Badge as a result, although the quest line will end.
        
        
        
        The Blade of Mercy was originally named as "Warped Twinblades" during the Alpha test, and it was the tool of choice for the "agile" hunter.
        Both the Burial Blade and Blade of Mercy make mentions of a mineral known as siderite in their descriptions.
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite, and it seems to be the reason why arcane power has direct scaling with both blade's damage output. Due to its extraterrestrial origins, that may explain why it cannot be buffed by an external source of any sort.
        It loosely resembles the Eleum Loyce from Dark Souls 2, a sword with two blades at the front.

        Bloodletter
        
        
        The demented hunter weapon brandished by Brador, the Healing Church assassin. 
        The Bloodletter assumes its true and terrifying form after it draws upon blood from the inner reaches of one's body and soul. 
        This is the only effective means of expelling tainted blood, or so Brador, isolated in his cell, continued to believe."
        
        
        
        Obtain the underground cell inner chamber key.
        Return to the underground prison (from the underground corpse pile lamp, go up the stairs and turn left) and open the door to Brador's cell. His cell is the second on the left behind a flight of downward stairs. Kill Brador to obtain the bloodletter.
        Brador will not be hostile in his cell, but will invade the player right outside his cell.

        Boom Hammer
        
        
        A trick weapon used by the old hunters, and crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. 
        A giant hammer equipped with a miniature furnace. When ignited and fired, it emits a volley of flame that explodes furiously upon impact. 
        Crush the beasts, then burn them - the brute simplicity of the Boom Hammer was favored by hunters with an acute distaste for beasts."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare. Inside a house that looks out of Central Yharnam, the same that is the shortcut to the cleric beast in the main game, where the 10 quicksilver bullets used to be. Be sure to shoot the explosives around the item (or act fast), as the wheelchair huntsman's corpse conceals a delayed molotov set to trigger when you try to grab the Boom Hammer, potential killing you in a huge blast.
        
        
        
        When the Boomhammer is lit, Beast Patient mobs will back away from the player as if they had a torch equipped. (May need to initiate primed attack first)

        Burial Blade
        
        
        Trick weapon wielded by Gehrman, the first hunter." 
        A masterpiece that defined the entire array of weapons crafted at the workshop. Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens. 
        Gehrman surely saw the hunt as a dirge of farewell, wishing only that his prey might rest in peace, never again to awaken to another harrowing nightmare. "
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 60,000 Blood Echoes after defeating Gehrman, the First Hunter and acquiring the Old Hunter Badge from him.
        To make Gehrman fight you, the "Refuse" option must be selected.
        If one accepts his proposal, the game will outright end there and it will be impossible to obtain this weapon in that playthrough (not including the uncanny/lost forms found in the chalice dungeons).
        Normally, the Burial Blade can only be obtained in NG+ and beyond. However, one can bypass this by using Bold Hunter's Mark, or being killed, during The Moon Presence boss battle.
        
        
        
         The Burial Blade was the first trick weapon ever created, and it inspired others to develop new trick weapons, usually on the premise of adapting to different combat scenerios.
        Not all weapons adapt to different combat scenerios (e.g. Tonitrus), but the Burial Blade still inspired an entire series of weapons that could "transform" to satisfy different purposes.
        It was created, and exclusively wielded, by Gehrman.
        A Burial Blade can be found above the workshop table in the Hunter's Dream.
        The weapon's description mentions that "Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens."
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite. Due to its extraterrestrial nature, it could be the reason why it has direct scaling with arcane and cannot be tampered by external sources.
        Both the Burial Blade and the Blade of Mercy mentions the use of it in their descriptions.
        Interestingly enough, these two weapons also resemble the talons of Mergo's Wet Nurse.
        The shape of the scythe highly resembles Rurufon's scythe from Shadow Tower Abyss, an early title created by From Software as well as being recurring weapons in Souls series.
        A strange bug on rare occurrences the cape on the hunter may come off, usually in a boss fight you could notice if you dodge back and do an R1 combo the cape disappears. [Note, I haven't seen this happen in a while, it's possible that it may have been fixed, but I'll need confirmation on this]

        Chikage
        
        
        Foreign-made weapon wielded by the royal guards who protect Annalise, Queen of the Vilebloods at Cainhurst Castle. 
        When the intricate, rippled engraving that spans the Chikage's blade is imbrued with blood, the sword sings in scarlet hues. 
        However, the rite eats away at the wielder's very essence."
        
        
        
        Join the Cainhurst Vilebloods covenant available at Cainhurst Castle, and then purchase from the Messengers for 50,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Chikage isn't actually a katana - it is a katana/european sword hybrid. Its short crossguard resembles the one of an early viking sword, or the one of a xiphos (greek sword). The closest european crossguard shape with  this sword is the one of a Karabela (a polish sabre). In other hand, the  hilt and pommel resemble the ones of a longsword (a bit longer, to get easier katana traditional jutsu swings), while the blade shape and the 2-handed fighting style is very similar to a katana. A possible explanation for the origin of this hybrid is that the katana's design was imported to Cainhurst, where some modifications were made to create a sword similar to that commonly used by their knights.
        The Chikage is an allusion to a particular 'breed' of Katanas in the Souls games. While it is similar to both the Hiltless and Chaos Blade from Demon's Souls and Dark Souls respectively, the Chikage bears a stronger resemblance to the Magic Sword "Makoto" (also from Demon's Souls). The Makoto is the only one the bunch to actually DRAIN the user's HP over time, rather than decrease it with each successful swing.
        Chikage (ÂçÉÊôØ) literally means "Thousands Views", however if you separated the word into Chi Kage (Ë°ÄÂΩ±), it means "Blood Shadow". This could be correlated to the fact that Shadows Of Yharnam wield a similar katana with a slight  crossguard, however without using the bloodtinge.
        The transforming attack has the hunter sheathe the Chikage before unleashing a strike. This is a reference to Iaijutsu, a traditional Japanese sword technique that focuses on quick-drawing. At its finest, Iaijutse allows the warrior to unsheathe and strike at incredible speeds.
        The name seems to be a tribute to Chikage Yamamura (mentioned as a "special thanks" in credits)
        The name may also be a reference to the work "1000 Plateaus" by Giles Deluze and Felix Guattari, a famous philosophical essay about fluidity and functionality, maybe dirrectly tied to the esoteric nature of the weapons function.

        Church Pick
        
        
        One of the old trick weapons of the Healing Church, a hunting weapon formed from one of the giant picks that appear in old beast tales. 
        The Church Pick initially serves as a large sword, but when transformed functions as an extended war pick. In spite of its origins, it is a highly practical weapon."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Dropped by a hunter wearing Yahar'Gul set (presumably, this is the summonable Old Hunter Defector Antal) in one of the cells that you open with the Underground Cell Key from the Research Hall. To make this battle simple, attack him through the door with a strong R2 attack, then leave the room. He will lose sight of you and his AI will return to a standstill behind the door. Rinse and repeat until dead.
        
        
        
        The Church Pick And The Hunter's Axe both have similar appearance. When transformed, both are wielded as a polearm and have the same de-transformation attack. The only difference apart from the Church Pick having a slightly more complicated mechanism is that the Hunter's Axe is a strength-based weapon.
        A few of its attacks in the transformed mode are very similar to that of the Burial Blade.

        Hunter Axe
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used on the hunt. Retains the qualities of an axe, but offers a wider palette of attacks by transforming. Boasts a heavy blunt attack, leading to high rally potential. No matter their pasts, beasts are no more than beasts. Some choose this axe to play the part of executioner."
        
        
        
        It's possible to pick this trick weapon as a starting weapon near the beginning of Bloodborne.
        If not chosen, it can instead be purchased from the Messengers after the Hunter has found the Saw Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is wielded by Father Gascoigne.
        However, he has a moveset that is different from the Hunter's version.
        He is also capable of using his unique Hunter Pistol even while his Hunter Axe is transformed, which is impossible for the Hunter to do.
        It's also wielded by the Madara's Twin who drops Madara's Whistle when defeated.
        Another hostile hunter NPC wields this trick weapon in the Nightmare Frontier.
        It's been heavily debated by the fanbase whether the transformed mode is a halberd or poleaxe.
        Both forms utilized axe heads with a spear tip at the end (although some poleaxes used hammer heads instead).
        However, neither weapon was known to have extendable handles, which is a special trademark of the Hunter Axe.
        In either case, it's possible this trick weapon was inspired by both weapons and simply incorporated many different designs.
        While wielded in it's transformed mode if the player had a torch equipped in the off-hand beasts afraid of the fire will still recoil in fear of you as if you were brandishing the torch normally (Tested on Beast Patient)

        Kirkhammer
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. On the one side, an easily handled silver sword. On the other, a giant obtuse stone weapon, characterized by a blunt strike and extreme force of impact. The Church takes a heavy-handed, merciless stance toward the plague of beasts, an irony not lost upon the wielders of this most symbolic weapon."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers after acquiring the Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        A miniature of the Kirkhammer was included as the Pre-Order Bonus for Asian editions of Bloodborne. [See the Bundles page for details]
        A "kirk" is an archaic old english word meaning "church."
        This means the weapon is literately known as the Church Hammer.
        The wording also might be a nod to Nordic culture since the word "Kirk" originated from northern England and Old Norse wording.
        The etched wording on the side of the hammer part has similarities to the Old Norse alphabet.
        However, it also has similarities to the Elder Futhark, one of the oldest forms of the runic alphabet system used by Germanic tribes.
        Similar etchings can be found on gravestones all over Yharnam.
        The sword used for this weapon is very similar to the one used for Ludwig's Holy Blade.
        This suggests that the Healing Church used the method of "interchangeable parts" to efficiently mass produce weapons for their hunters.
        However, the sword used for the Kirkhammer is shorter.
        It's wielded by Alfred, should you choose to be friends with him.
        He uses this weapon as a summon.
        However, he wields the Logarius' Wheel if you find him in Cainhurst Castle under special circumstances.
        When untransformed, with the hammer part on the character's back, some cloth parts (capes etc.) of the armor can either get awkwardly stuck on it or cover it.
        Despite being labeled a 'stone weapon', the etchings, wear, and sound produced when it strikes indicate that the hammer is in fact made of metal.

        Kos Parasite
        
        
        When the carcass of Kos washed up on the coast, its insides were teeming with tiny parasites, unlike any found in humans. 
        This atypical weapon can only be clasped tight and swung, but a Kos Parasite is said to stimulate phantasms inhabiting a lumenwood"
        
        
        
        Dropped by Orphan of Kos
        
        
        
        The Kos Parasite is perhaps the most interestingly unique weapon in Bloodborne in various ways: It is one of two weapons that can reach it's full potential while using a rune (the other being Beast Claw), the weapon itself is not held, it is purely an arcane weapon, it is the only weapon directly dropped by defeating a boss, it has the highest durability of any weapon at 600 respectively, it is the only weapon to have an A-scaling of any weapon without any upgrades and is the only weapon to have an S-scaling by upgrading it twice.

        Logarius's Wheel
        
        
        "Weapon wielded by martyr Logarius' band of executioners. 
        Used to slaughter the Vilebloods in Cainhurst. Bathed in pools of their blood, and forever steeped in their ire. 
        Transform to release the power of the wheel and manifest their lingering rage in a show of utter brilliance."
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 13,000 Blood Echoes after acquiring the Wheel Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        Alfred utilizes the Logarius' Wheel when found in Cainhurst Castle.
        This weapon is yet another reference to Berserk, as they are often made in Miyazaki's previous Souls games.
        "Logarius and his band of executioners" bear many similarities to Mozgus, an insanely devout man who traveled the land torturing heretics along with his disciples.
        The wheel in particular was wielded by one of his six disciples, .
        In Dark Souls, Bonewheel Skeletons are another reference to Mozgus' disciples.
        In real life, although wheels weren't typically wielded as weapons, they were commonly used as torture devices, especially during the Middle Ages.
        Torture wheels were nicknamed "breaking wheels," since victims often times would have their limbs broken during the process.
        They were also known as "catherine wheels."
         It's quite possible that Logarius' Wheel also takes some inspiration in its use as a weapon from the English folklore legend of Tom Hickathrift. Tom was a fabled giant killer who made use of a cartwheel to vanquish the Wisbech Giant (also referred to as an ogre).
        Lore theories can be found under "From Berserk to Bloodborne".

        Ludwig's Holy Blade
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. It is said that the silver sword was employed by Ludwig, the first hunter of the church. When transformed, it combines with its sheath to form a greatsword. 
        It exhibits several departures from the workshop's design, suggesting that the Church anticipated much larger inhuman beasts."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased for 20,000 echoes from the Messengers after obtaining the Radiant Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon was wielded by Ludwig, a famous hunter of the Healing Church who designed the blade based on the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        According to the description, Ludwig wielded this sword in combat instead of the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        However, in his boss fight, he wields the Holy Moonlight Sword during a certain part in the fight.
        It is possible that Ludwig wielded the Holy Moonlight Sword and his fellow hunters, inspired by the huge weapon, sought to make replicas. Unable to make a magic sword, a huge metal sheath was the compromise.
        Before the DLC's release, Ludwig's Holy Blade was thought of as From Software's traditional "Moonlight Greatsword" seen throughout various games by the fanbase.
        However, this sword was eventually revealed in the DLC to be a replica of the "true" Moonlight Greatsword in Bloodborne, the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        This isn't the first time Miyazaki used the name of classical music composers in a game.
        A boss from the first "Dark Souls" game, Dragonslayer Ornstein, is named after Leo Ornstein.
        Berlioz from "Armored Core 4" is named after Hector Berlioz.
        The normal form of this weapon is very similar to the sword used for the Kirkhammer.
        However, this sword's normal form has a slightly longer reach when compared to the Kirkhammer's blade.
        The similar nature of these swords suggests that the Healing Church used the method of interchangeable parts to quickly mass produce weapons for their hunters.

        Rakuyo
        
        
        Hunter weapon wielded by Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower. 
        A trick sword originated in the same country as the Cainhurst Chikage, only this sword feeds not off blood, but instead demands great dexterity. 
        Lady Maria was fond of this aspect of the Rakuyo, as she frowned upon blood blades, despite being a distant relative of the queen. 
        One day, she abandoned her beloved Rakuyo, casting it into a dark well, when she could stomach it no longer."
        
        
        
        Fishing Hamlet. Get to the bottom of the well. Can be reached from the underground tunnels at the end of the area or via a ladder in the well right away. In that area a Shark Giant will wander around. Fighting him makes a second one appear after the first reaches sufficiently low health. The first giant will walk over near the ladder and scream at the ceiling, causing the second one to drop. The second one drops the weapon.
        Fighting the two of them can be difficult and it is a good idea to use the Shaman Bone Blade to make them fight each other and finish off the weaker one. Molotov cocktails are also very effective against them. If neither is available to you, try to kill the one with the anchor first, as it is significantly harder to dodge.
        One easy way to beat them is use of ranged weapon like Simon's Bowblade if you are a bloodtinge build, and the Holy Moonlight Sword if you are an arcane build.
        A Threaded Cane's transformed whip can easily hit the giants from the ledge once they're lured over and begin attacking, but be sure to keep your distance after each hit. Except that there is no way to lure them over the the ledge. No ranged weapon will hit the one standing at the back and the one hanging from the ceiling doesn't drop down until the first one is at 50% health. 
        Unlike other giants in the game, these ones are easy to gun parry for a visceral attack. Keep in mind this will get very tricky after the other one starts fighting, so try to separate them and time your viscerals to get the invincibility at the right moment.
        If your range is inadequate you can use the monocular to angle a throwing knife to be able to hit the shark giant in the back. This way, you can continue from the strategy of killing them on the ledge with a gun/magic without going around. (confirmed as of January 19th, 2019)
        Chaining together backstabs is a very effecient way of dealing with them, if played right you should be able to eliminate the first shark giant before the second reaches you this way. It is extremely difficult to get behind the patrolling Shark Giant without him detecting you. 
        For a video showing an easy way to kill the sharks with a monocular and a throwing knife strategy, check .
        
        
        
        Rakuyo (ËêΩËëâ) literally means "falling leaf".
        The sword of Rakuyo bears resemblance to the "ky≈´ gunt≈ç", which was a hybrid of the sabre/katana with a handguard, used during the Russo-Japanese War.

        Weapon wielded by the Knights of Cainhurst. 
        Combines an elegant knight's sword with the peculiar firearm wielded by the Cainhurst order. 
        The old nobles, long-time imbibers of blood, are no strangers to the sanguine plague, and the disposal of beasts was a discrete task left to their servants, or knights, as they were called for the sake of appearances."
        
        
        
        It's found in a chest located in the entrance hall of Cainhurst Castle, where the Bound Widows are first encountered. When you first enter the room from the main entrance, run towards your two o'clock. The chest will be found in a corner.
        
        
        
        The Reiterpallasch (from German Reiter "horseback rider" and hungarian pallos [Ààp…ílo É] "sword") is a 17th century Hungarian straight sword with a typically double edged blade and guarded hilt that was used by Hungarian noble cavalry and later adapted by most western European armies.
        As pointed out in its description, the rifle spear is made "possibly in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon" (i.e. this one).
        Wynne D. Fanchon from Armored Core: For Answer; another From Software title, pilots a NEXT named Reiterpallasch.

Lacks any notable functions, saving that it is the only trick weapon with an attached gun. "
        
        
        
        It can be found inside a hidden building in Old Yharnam. From the area you fight the first NPC Hunter (who wields a saw spear), drop down where the railing is missing in a corner and land on the ledges below. Go into the building and follow the stairs up; eventually you can find it stashed on a corpse tucked away in a hidden nook as you advance.
        Bought from the messengers for 4000 blood echoes after acquiring the Powder Keg Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        According to the Rifle Spear's description, it was designed as an imitation of "a lost Cainhurst weapon".
        That particular weapon may or may not be the Reiterpallasch.
        It should be noted these two weapons are the only two skill/firearm hybrids whose alternate forms utilize guns.
        The third skill/firearm hybrid weapon in this game is Simon's Bowblade, which transforms from a sword into a bow.
        The Rifle Spear is carried by a Yahar'Gul Hunter in the Cathedral Ward.
        This fight can be tricky because you first encounter a Yahar'Gul Hunter that uses a Tonitrus near the base of the stairs, and if you advance too far towards the houses, the Rifle Spear Yahar'Gul Hunter will join the fight as well.
        He also uses Ludwig's Rifle, meaning he can hit you from a considerable distance with shotgun pellets no matter what mode he uses for the Rifle Spear.
        
        
    

        Holy Moonlight Sword
        
        
        An arcane sword discovered long ago by Ludwig. 
        When blue moonlight dances around the sword, and it channels the abyssal cosmos, its great blade will hurl a shadowy lightwave. 
        The Holy Moonlight Sword is synonymous with Ludwig, the Holy Blade, but few have ever set eyes on the great blade, and whatever guidance it has to offer, it seems to be of a very private, elusive sort."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Found on the Underground Corpse Pile after the fight against Ludwig, The Holy Blade. Ludwig's head will be lying there and you can:
        Kill the head for the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and talk to the head. When prompted, reply "Yes" and you'll get the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and reply "No", then come back later and Simon the Harrowed will be there and give you the sword.
        NOTE: This weapon is missable. If Lawrence is killed before you obtain it, you will no longer be able to talk to the head or obtain it from Simon.
        
        
        
        It seems to be another reappearance of the Moonlight Greatsword, a recurring item found around FromSoftware's games.

        Saw Cleaver
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used in the hunting business. 
        This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts, transforms into a long cleaver that makes use of centrifugal force. 
        The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness the more grotesquely transformed the beast."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired as a gift from the Messengers the first time you visit the Hunter's Dream.
        If you don't select it, you may buy it after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne.)
        
        
        
        The Saw Cleaver is the Trick Weapon featured on the title screen.
        It was also one of the first weapons to be revealed for this game.
        Overall the mechanisms of this weapon didn't change at all, starting all the way back when Bloodborne was still known as "Project Beast."
        According to the concept art, the Saw Cleaver uses a trigger mechanism to unlock the joint during transformation.
        The design of the Saw Cleaver seems to be inspired by multiple references:
        The transformed cleaver shows a resemblance to LB-66 MOONLIGHT from Armored Core V.
        The Japanese name is written as "nokogiri nata" („Éé„Ç≥„ÇÆ„É™Èâà) or "saw hatchet". Nokogiri is a traditional Japanese saw that cuts from the pull stroke, as opposed to the more common push stroke.
        In real life, there is a type of cleaver known as a mezzaluna ("half moon") cleaver, known for chopping/mincing up various food products.
        Most of these types of cleavers have handles on both ends.
        However, some use a single handle that stretches across the blade, which was used to chop up herbs usually; the saw cleaver follows this particular model.
        Coincidentally, the Strength/Skill/Arcane scaling at maximum level is "CDC" in their respective order.
        The CDC is an American organization designed to combat and prevent "health threats" of varying natures.
        Since the beast scourge acts like a plague (and is spread due to blood-related reasons), those who wield the Saw Cleaver can be thought of as fighting a dangerous epidemic.
        Henryk uses this weapon when he fights you and Eileen the Crow during her questline, as well as when he is summoned by you when using the Old Hunter Bell.

        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used by those who dedicate themselves to the hunt. This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts, transforms into a medium-range spear. The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness the more grotesquely transformed the beast."
        
        
        
        Can be bought from the Bath Messengers, after obtaining the Saw Hunter Badge, for 1,000 Blood Echoes.

        Simon's Bowblade
        
        
        Choice weapon of Simon, one of the first Healing Church hunters.
        Simon despised firearms, and so the Church workshop had this specially fashioned to his liking. The large curved blade serves as a bow when transformed.
        But aside from a few close friends, Simon was scoffed at for his choice of arms, for who would dare face the beasts with a measly bow?"
        
        
        
        Fishing Hamlet: Found on the body of Simon the Harrowed next to the Lighthouse Hut lantern after answering the first option at the Hunter's Nightmare shortcut and going through his quest-line. Interact with him as he lies on the ground to obtain the weapon.
        You may also kill Simon the Harrowed at The Hunter's Nightmare or Research Hall to obtain the weapon.
        
        
        
        Simon's Bowblade is the only weapon to have a S-scaling for two attributes (Skill and Bloodtinge respectively) when fully upgraded

        Stake Driver
        
        
        A trick weapon fashioned by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. Favored by the retired hunter Djura. 
        The stake driver, with its queerly complex design, violently drives thick stakes into the flesh of foes. 
        The stake driver allows for high-damage critical attacks, but is difficult to use and leaves its wielder wide open, but none of this should bother a mere Powder Keg."
        
        
        
        Obtain Powder Keg Hunter Badge to unlock for purchase at the Messengers for 8,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Stake Driver is exclusively wielded by Djura when he is still hostile towards you.
        His fight is tricky because the area around him is very limited, meaning you can fall to your death if you're not careful.
        Furthermore, the limited space is perfect for his choice of weapon which has a short range.
        This is modeled after the "Pile Bunker," a type of fictional weaponry which launches piston with gunpowder or explosion.
        In the Japanese version of Bloodborne, this weapon is literally called the Pile Hammer („Éë„Ç§„É´„Éè„É≥„Éû„Éº).
        It bears a striking resemblance to the "Parrying Blade" weapons seen in several "Armored Core" games.
        Has the highest charged attack multiplier out of any other weapon.

        Threaded Cane
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used by hunters on their duties. Sufficiently deadly as a rigid bladed cane, but also serves as a whip when its blade is split into many. Concealing the weapon inside the cane and flogging the beasts with the whip is partly an act of ceremony, an attempt to demonstrate to oneself that the bloodlust of the hunt will never encroach upon the soul."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired at the beginning of the game as a gift from the Messengers.
        If not selected, it is later available for purchase from the blood fountain messengers after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne).
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is used by Iosefka, Last Scholar Yurie and the Frontier Church Hunter.
        Gehrman carries a generic cane in the Workshop instead of the Threaded Cane.
        This trick weapon is possibly inspired by the sword used by Jean-Fran√ßois de Morangias in the climactic battle of French action-horror film Brotherhood of the Wolf (which bears many other similarities to Bloodborne), or the sword used by a bandit leader in the anime/manga series Claymore. Both these weapons act as a straight, double-edged sword that can transform into a segmented, bladed whip.

        Tonitrus
        
        
        "A unique trick weapon contrived by Archibald, the infamous eccentric of the Healing Church workshop. 
        Striking this peculiar iron morning star flail like a match generates the same blue sparks that blanket a darkbeast. 
        Unfortunately, for reasons untold, the hunters of Archibald's time did not fully take to the device."
        
        
        
        Acquire the Spark Hunter Badge by defeating Darkbeast Paarl  to purchase from Messengers.
        Treasure: Yahar'gul, Unseen Village, at the top end of the road. (guarded by 2 Tainted Dogs and a Snatcher during daytime)
        
        
        
        Tonitrus is a Latin word meaning "thunder."
        The in-game description classifies this trick weapon as a morning star flail, but it's actually modeled in the form of a mace.
        The description of Archibald bears many similarities to Nikola Tesla, a famed inventor in real life who specialized in the field of electricity.
        Nikola Tesla created the Tesla Coil, a device that also bears many similarities to the Tonitrus.
        The Tonitrus also bears similarities with the aspergillum, a device used by the Roman Catholic Church to sprinkle holy water.
        According to the description of the Spark Hunter Badge, Archibald was associated with the Healing Church.
        In this sense, it may have been designed under the themes of "purificiation" and "cleansing" that is associated with many Healing Church trick weapons/tools.
        However, due to Archibald's fascination with Dark Beasts, it's more likely he designed the Tonitrus as a measure to replicate the sparks these creatures could unleash.

        Whirligig Saw
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs, and weapon of choice of the Old Hunter Valtr, the Beast Eater. 
        This weapon pummels beasts in its mace form, but its true strength lies in its attached mechanical saws. 
        These discs, lined with serrated teeth,spin rapidly, thrashing the flesh of beasts into fine shreds."
        
        
        
        From the Nightmare Church go down the stairs and follow the path. Drop down into the pools of blood of follow the path further until you reach the Cannon Executioner. Follow the left wall and turn down the path, the weapon is at the end.
        
        
        
        If you use the L2 buzzsaw attack against Orphan of Kos and hold it in place, it attempts to make an immediate counterattack for each time it gets hit by the whirring blades, only to get interrupted by the next hit. It shrieks every time it attacks, so as a result, it lets loose dozens of overlapping shriek sound effects for as long as you hold it in place.
        A whirligig is defined as a toy that is constantly spinning, such as a top or pinwheel, or as something regarded as hectic and constantly changing.
        Similar to most Powder Keg weapons sharing homage to Armored Core weapons, the Whirligig Saw is based on the Grind Blade.
        
    

        Hunter Axe
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used on the hunt. Retains the qualities of an axe, but offers a wider palette of attacks by transforming. Boasts a heavy blunt attack, leading to high rally potential. No matter their pasts, beasts are no more than beasts. Some choose this axe to play the part of executioner."
        
        
        
        It's possible to pick this trick weapon as a starting weapon near the beginning of Bloodborne.
        If not chosen, it can instead be purchased from the Messengers after the Hunter has found the Saw Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is wielded by Father Gascoigne.
        However, he has a moveset that is different from the Hunter's version.
        He is also capable of using his unique Hunter Pistol even while his Hunter Axe is transformed, which is impossible for the Hunter to do.
        It's also wielded by the Madara's Twin who drops Madara's Whistle when defeated.
        Another hostile hunter NPC wields this trick weapon in the Nightmare Frontier.
        It's been heavily debated by the fanbase whether the transformed mode is a halberd or poleaxe.
        Both forms utilized axe heads with a spear tip at the end (although some poleaxes used hammer heads instead).
        However, neither weapon was known to have extendable handles, which is a special trademark of the Hunter Axe.
        In either case, it's possible this trick weapon was inspired by both weapons and simply incorporated many different designs.
        While wielded in it's transformed mode if the player had a torch equipped in the off-hand beasts afraid of the fire will still recoil in fear of you as if you were brandishing the torch normally (Tested on Beast Patient)

        Amygdalan Arm 
        
        
        The arm of a small Amygdala Great One. 
        Strictly speaking, the Amygdalan Arm is no trick weapon of any sort, but certain madmen wield them like clubs. 
        Starts as a large, tough blunt weapon formed of bone, but when extended, the hand quivers as if it were still alive.
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare, cave at the end of the blood river to the right after getting out of the building that used to be the shortcut to the Cleric Beast in the main game. Gatling Gun Hunter dropping the Gatling Gun and a Blood-Starved Beast can be also found here. Arm is near the Blood-Starved Beast at the end of the cave.
        
        
        
        The Amygdalan Arm is a Trick Weapon in name only, considering that it is an arm obtained from Amygdala.
        The arm is remarkably small, as even the Lesser Amygdalae are huge. Perhaps it came from a newborn Amygdala.
        The arm could be the inspiration behind the Burial Blade.
        
        
    

        Hunter Axe
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used on the hunt. Retains the qualities of an axe, but offers a wider palette of attacks by transforming. Boasts a heavy blunt attack, leading to high rally potential. No matter their pasts, beasts are no more than beasts. Some choose this axe to play the part of executioner."
        
        
        
        It's possible to pick this trick weapon as a starting weapon near the beginning of Bloodborne.
        If not chosen, it can instead be purchased from the Messengers after the Hunter has found the Saw Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is wielded by Father Gascoigne.
        However, he has a moveset that is different from the Hunter's version.
        He is also capable of using his unique Hunter Pistol even while his Hunter Axe is transformed, which is impossible for the Hunter to do.
        It's also wielded by the Madara's Twin who drops Madara's Whistle when defeated.
        Another hostile hunter NPC wields this trick weapon in the Nightmare Frontier.
        It's been heavily debated by the fanbase whether the transformed mode is a halberd or poleaxe.
        Both forms utilized axe heads with a spear tip at the end (although some poleaxes used hammer heads instead).
        However, neither weapon was known to have extendable handles, which is a special trademark of the Hunter Axe.
        In either case, it's possible this trick weapon was inspired by both weapons and simply incorporated many different designs.
        While wielded in it's transformed mode if the player had a torch equipped in the off-hand beasts afraid of the fire will still recoil in fear of you as if you were brandishing the torch normally (Tested on Beast Patient)

        Beast Claw
        
        
        Beastly weapon wielded by Irreverent Izzy.
        Crafted by chiseling the long bones of an undead darkbeast and fastening them to the weapon. The bones are still alive, and when unleashed, grant its wielder a spurt of beastly power. 
        As flesh is flayed and blood is sprayed, the beast within awakens, and in time, the wielder of this weapon surges with both strength and feverish reverie."
        
        
        
        Ailing Loran Chalice: Layer 2 treasure room. Room is on the right when exiting the elevator from first layer boss fight, before the second layers lantern.
        Can be bought from messengers for 34000 echoes after acquisition.
        Can be bought from messengers after co-operation with player who has them. This only occurs in Hunter's dream before fight with Gehrman or Moon Presence. It is not needed to complete any Chalice Dungeons. It is unknown if this is glitch or intentional. Was patched by 1.07 or 1.08.
        
        
        
        When this weapon is equipped, your gloves will be replaced by two bone gauntlets. This can allow for the lost art of rapid glove changing if you switch your weapons really fast.
        You can charge the beasthood meter on the first windows (Gilbert) of Central Yharnam
        In the past, there was a rare glitch that allowed a player to obtain this weapon without finding it in the Chalice Dungeons.
        It has since been patched, although it isn't quite known when it was successfully patched.

        Beasthunter Saif
        
        
        A trick weapon used by the old hunters. 
        A second blade is found inside the curve of the main one. In its initial form, the saif can be wielded like a long curved sword, but when transformed, its blade is contracted, allowing for quick, repeated stabs. 
        Although this trick weapon allows for adaptive combat, it was later replaced by saws and similar weapons that were more effective at disposing of beasts."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare. After the Blood River, when you pass through the cave with a tick, where you encounter two dogs and a large amount of crows along with an enemy Beast Cutter hunter. Climb the ladder on the left of the pit and instead of going forward, turn to the left and drop down the ledge. There will be a single piece of loot guarded by a Saif Hunter.

        Beast Cutter
        
        
        A trick weapon used by Old Hunters. 
        This thick iron cleaver slices through the toughest of beast hides, and when transformed the blade splits into sections, allowing one to lash it in the fashion of a heavy whip. 
        This crude weapon relies on brute force and is regrettably inelegant, suggesting that the hunts of the earliest hunters made for horrific affairs, painted in sanguine black and reds."
        
        
        
        When walking up the stairs to the nightmare version of the Grand Cathedral, turn left onto a small platform, then roll off and walk down some rough terrain to find the weapon on a corpse.
        
        
        
        Reminds many of the Zanpakut≈ç , a fictional segmented sword that can function as a whip. It is an iconic weapon from the Bleach anime.
        The untransformed form of the weapon is a cleaver-like serrated club, and it really looks like the samoan war club "Nifo Oti".

        Blade of mercy
        
        
        A special trick weapon passed down among hunters of hunters. One of the oldest weapons of the workshop. 
        Splits into two when activated. The weapon's warped blades are forged with siderite, a rare mineral of the heavens. Most effective swift attacks,such as after a quick-stepping."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers for 40000 echoes after obtaining the Crow Hunter Badge from Eileen the Crow's quest line.
        Killing Eileen is also a way to get the weapon early in the game.
        While progressing through Eileen's quest, it's possible for her to be killed by Henryk and thus drop the Crow Hunter Badge as a result, although the quest line will end.
        
        
        
        The Blade of Mercy was originally named as "Warped Twinblades" during the Alpha test, and it was the tool of choice for the "agile" hunter.
        Both the Burial Blade and Blade of Mercy make mentions of a mineral known as siderite in their descriptions.
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite, and it seems to be the reason why arcane power has direct scaling with both blade's damage output. Due to its extraterrestrial origins, that may explain why it cannot be buffed by an external source of any sort.
        It loosely resembles the Eleum Loyce from Dark Souls 2, a sword with two blades at the front.

        Bloodletter
        
        
        The demented hunter weapon brandished by Brador, the Healing Church assassin. 
        The Bloodletter assumes its true and terrifying form after it draws upon blood from the inner reaches of one's body and soul. 
        This is the only effective means of expelling tainted blood, or so Brador, isolated in his cell, continued to believe."
        
        
        
        Obtain the underground cell inner chamber key.
        Return to the underground prison (from the underground corpse pile lamp, go up the stairs and turn left) and open the door to Brador's cell. His cell is the second on the left behind a flight of downward stairs. Kill Brador to obtain the bloodletter.
        Brador will not be hostile in his cell, but will invade the player right outside his cell.

        Boom Hammer
        
        
        A trick weapon used by the old hunters, and crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. 
        A giant hammer equipped with a miniature furnace. When ignited and fired, it emits a volley of flame that explodes furiously upon impact. 
        Crush the beasts, then burn them - the brute simplicity of the Boom Hammer was favored by hunters with an acute distaste for beasts."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare. Inside a house that looks out of Central Yharnam, the same that is the shortcut to the cleric beast in the main game, where the 10 quicksilver bullets used to be. Be sure to shoot the explosives around the item (or act fast), as the wheelchair huntsman's corpse conceals a delayed molotov set to trigger when you try to grab the Boom Hammer, potential killing you in a huge blast.
        
        
        
        When the Boomhammer is lit, Beast Patient mobs will back away from the player as if they had a torch equipped. (May need to initiate primed attack first)

        Burial Blade
        
        
        Trick weapon wielded by Gehrman, the first hunter." 
        A masterpiece that defined the entire array of weapons crafted at the workshop. Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens. 
        Gehrman surely saw the hunt as a dirge of farewell, wishing only that his prey might rest in peace, never again to awaken to another harrowing nightmare. "
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 60,000 Blood Echoes after defeating Gehrman, the First Hunter and acquiring the Old Hunter Badge from him.
        To make Gehrman fight you, the "Refuse" option must be selected.
        If one accepts his proposal, the game will outright end there and it will be impossible to obtain this weapon in that playthrough (not including the uncanny/lost forms found in the chalice dungeons).
        Normally, the Burial Blade can only be obtained in NG+ and beyond. However, one can bypass this by using Bold Hunter's Mark, or being killed, during The Moon Presence boss battle.
        
        
        
         The Burial Blade was the first trick weapon ever created, and it inspired others to develop new trick weapons, usually on the premise of adapting to different combat scenerios.
        Not all weapons adapt to different combat scenerios (e.g. Tonitrus), but the Burial Blade still inspired an entire series of weapons that could "transform" to satisfy different purposes.
        It was created, and exclusively wielded, by Gehrman.
        A Burial Blade can be found above the workshop table in the Hunter's Dream.
        The weapon's description mentions that "Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens."
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite. Due to its extraterrestrial nature, it could be the reason why it has direct scaling with arcane and cannot be tampered by external sources.
        Both the Burial Blade and the Blade of Mercy mentions the use of it in their descriptions.
        Interestingly enough, these two weapons also resemble the talons of Mergo's Wet Nurse.
        The shape of the scythe highly resembles Rurufon's scythe from Shadow Tower Abyss, an early title created by From Software as well as being recurring weapons in Souls series.
        A strange bug on rare occurrences the cape on the hunter may come off, usually in a boss fight you could notice if you dodge back and do an R1 combo the cape disappears. [Note, I haven't seen this happen in a while, it's possible that it may have been fixed, but I'll need confirmation on this]

        Join the Cainhurst Vilebloods covenant available at Cainhurst Castle, and then purchase from the Messengers for 50,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Chikage isn't actually a katana - it is a katana/european sword hybrid. Its short crossguard resembles the one of an early viking sword, or the one of a xiphos (greek sword). The closest european crossguard shape with  this sword is the one of a Karabela (a polish sabre). In other hand, the  hilt and pommel resemble the ones of a longsword (a bit longer, to get easier katana traditional jutsu swings), while the blade shape and the 2-handed fighting style is very similar to a katana. A possible explanation for the origin of this hybrid is that the katana's design was imported to Cainhurst, where some modifications were made to create a sword similar to that commonly used by their knights.
        The Chikage is an allusion to a particular 'breed' of Katanas in the Souls games. While it is similar to both the Hiltless and Chaos Blade from Demon's Souls and Dark Souls respectively, the Chikage bears a stronger resemblance to the Magic Sword "Makoto" (also from Demon's Souls). The Makoto is the only one the bunch to actually DRAIN the user's HP over time, rather than decrease it with each successful swing.
        Chikage (ÂçÉÊôØ) literally means "Thousands Views", however if you separated the word into Chi Kage (Ë°ÄÂΩ±), it means "Blood Shadow". This could be correlated to the fact that Shadows Of Yharnam wield a similar katana with a slight  crossguard, however without using the bloodtinge.
        The transforming attack has the hunter sheathe the Chikage before unleashing a strike. This is a reference to Iaijutsu, a traditional Japanese sword technique that focuses on quick-drawing. At its finest, Iaijutse allows the warrior to unsheathe and strike at incredible speeds.
        The name seems to be a tribute to Chikage Yamamura (mentioned as a "special thanks" in credits)
        The name may also be a reference to the work "1000 Plateaus" by Giles Deluze and Felix Guattari, a famous philosophical essay about fluidity and functionality, maybe dirrectly tied to the esoteric nature of the weapons function.

        Church Pick
        
        
        One of the old trick weapons of the Healing Church, a hunting weapon formed from one of the giant picks that appear in old beast tales. 
        The Church Pick initially serves as a large sword, but when transformed functions as an extended war pick. In spite of its origins, it is a highly practical weapon."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Dropped by a hunter wearing Yahar'Gul set (presumably, this is the summonable Old Hunter Defector Antal) in one of the cells that you open with the Underground Cell Key from the Research Hall. To make this battle simple, attack him through the door with a strong R2 attack, then leave the room. He will lose sight of you and his AI will return to a standstill behind the door. Rinse and repeat until dead.
        
        
        
        The Church Pick And The Hunter's Axe both have similar appearance. When transformed, both are wielded as a polearm and have the same de-transformation attack. The only difference apart from the Church Pick having a slightly more complicated mechanism is that the Hunter's Axe is a strength-based weapon.
        A few of its attacks in the transformed mode are very similar to that of the Burial Blade.

        Holy Moonlight Sword
        
        
        An arcane sword discovered long ago by Ludwig. 
        When blue moonlight dances around the sword, and it channels the abyssal cosmos, its great blade will hurl a shadowy lightwave. 
        The Holy Moonlight Sword is synonymous with Ludwig, the Holy Blade, but few have ever set eyes on the great blade, and whatever guidance it has to offer, it seems to be of a very private, elusive sort."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Found on the Underground Corpse Pile after the fight against Ludwig, The Holy Blade. Ludwig's head will be lying there and you can:
        Kill the head for the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and talk to the head. When prompted, reply "Yes" and you'll get the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and reply "No", then come back later and Simon the Harrowed will be there and give you the sword.
        NOTE: This weapon is missable. If Lawrence is killed before you obtain it, you will no longer be able to talk to the head or obtain it from Simon.
        
        
        
        It seems to be another reappearance of the Moonlight Greatsword, a recurring item found around FromSoftware's games. Notable examples of such games include the first, second and third Dark Souls games, Demon's Souls, King's Field, Ninja Blade, Enchanted Arms, Armored Core, 3D Dot Game Heroes, and Otogi.

        Kirkhammer
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. On the one side, an easily handled silver sword. On the other, a giant obtuse stone weapon, characterized by a blunt strike and extreme force of impact. The Church takes a heavy-handed, merciless stance toward the plague of beasts, an irony not lost upon the wielders of this most symbolic weapon."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers after acquiring the Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        A miniature of the Kirkhammer was included as the Pre-Order Bonus for Asian editions of Bloodborne. [See the Bundles page for details]
        A "kirk" is an archaic old english word meaning "church."
        This means the weapon is literately known as the Church Hammer.
        The wording also might be a nod to Nordic culture since the word "Kirk" originated from northern England and Old Norse wording.
        The etched wording on the side of the hammer part has similarities to the Old Norse alphabet.
        However, it also has similarities to the Elder Futhark, one of the oldest forms of the runic alphabet system used by Germanic tribes.
        Similar etchings can be found on gravestones all over Yharnam.
        The sword used for this weapon is very similar to the one used for Ludwig's Holy Blade.
        This suggests that the Healing Church used the method of "interchangeable parts" to efficiently mass produce weapons for their hunters.
        However, the sword used for the Kirkhammer is shorter.
        It's wielded by Alfred, should you choose to be friends with him.
        He uses this weapon as a summon.
        However, he wields the Logarius' Wheel if you find him in Cainhurst Castle under special circumstances.
        When untransformed, with the hammer part on the character's back, some cloth parts (capes etc.) of the armor can either get awkwardly stuck on it or cover it.
        Despite being labeled a 'stone weapon', the etchings, wear, and sound produced when it strikes indicate that the hammer is in fact made of metal.

        Logarius's Wheel
        
        
        "Weapon wielded by martyr Logarius' band of executioners.

        Transform to release the power of the wheel and manifest their lingering rage in a show of utter brilliance."
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 13,000 Blood Echoes after acquiring the Wheel Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        Alfred utilizes the Logarius' Wheel when found in Cainhurst Castle.
        This weapon is yet another reference to Berserk, as they are often made in Miyazaki's previous Souls games.
        "Logarius and his band of executioners" bear many similarities to Mozgus, an insanely devout man who traveled the land torturing heretics along with his disciples.
        The wheel in particular was wielded by one of his six disciples, .
        In Dark Souls, Bonewheel Skeletons are another reference to Mozgus' disciples.
        In real life, although wheels weren't typically wielded as weapons, they were commonly used as torture devices, especially during the Middle Ages.
        Torture wheels were nicknamed "breaking wheels," since victims often times would have their limbs broken during the process.
        They were also known as "catherine wheels."
         It's quite possible that Logarius' Wheel also takes some inspiration in its use as a weapon from the English folklore legend of Tom Hickathrift. Tom was a fabled giant killer who made use of a cartwheel to vanquish the Wisbech Giant (also referred to as an ogre).
        Lore theories can be found under "From Berserk to Bloodborne".

        Ludwig's Holy Blade
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. It is said that the silver sword was employed by Ludwig, the first hunter of the church. When transformed, it combines with its sheath to form a greatsword. 
        It exhibits several departures from the workshop's design, suggesting that the Church anticipated much larger inhuman beasts."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased for 20,000 echoes from the Messengers after obtaining the Radiant Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon was wielded by Ludwig, a famous hunter of the Healing Church who designed the blade based on the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        According to the description, Ludwig wielded this sword in combat instead of the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        However, in his boss fight, he wields the Holy Moonlight Sword during a certain part in the fight.
        It is possible that Ludwig wielded the Holy Moonlight Sword and his fellow hunters, inspired by the huge weapon, sought to make replicas. Unable to make a magic sword, a huge metal sheath was the compromise.
        Before the DLC's release, Ludwig's Holy Blade was thought of as From Software's traditional "Moonlight Greatsword" seen throughout various games by the fanbase.
        However, this sword was eventually revealed in the DLC to be a replica of the "true" Moonlight Greatsword in Bloodborne, the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        This isn't the first time Miyazaki used the name of classical music composers in a game.
        A boss from the first "Dark Souls" game, Dragonslayer Ornstein, is named after Leo Ornstein.
        Berlioz from "Armored Core 4" is named after Hector Berlioz.
        The normal form of this weapon is very similar to the sword used for the Kirkhammer.
        However, this sword's normal form has a slightly longer reach when compared to the Kirkhammer's blade.
        The similar nature of these swords suggests that the Healing Church used the method of interchangeable parts to quickly mass produce weapons for their hunters.

        Hunter Axe
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used on the hunt. Retains the qualities of an axe, but offers a wider palette of attacks by transforming. Boasts a heavy blunt attack, leading to high rally potential. No matter their pasts, beasts are no more than beasts. Some choose this axe to play the part of executioner."

        This trick weapon is wielded by Father Gascoigne.
        However, he has a moveset that is different from the Hunter's version.
        He is also capable of using his unique Hunter Pistol even while his Hunter Axe is transformed, which is impossible for the Hunter to do.
        It's also wielded by the Madara's Twin who drops Madara's Whistle when defeated.
        Another hostile hunter NPC wields this trick weapon in the Nightmare Frontier.
        It's been heavily debated by the fanbase whether the transformed mode is a halberd or poleaxe.
        Both forms utilized axe heads with a spear tip at the end (although some poleaxes used hammer heads instead).
        However, neither weapon was known to have extendable handles, which is a special trademark of the Hunter Axe.
        In either case, it's possible this trick weapon was inspired by both weapons and simply incorporated many different designs.

        Rakuyo
        
        
        Hunter weapon wielded by Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower. 
        A trick sword originated in the same country as the Cainhurst Chikage, only this sword feeds not off blood, but instead demands great dexterity. 
        Lady Maria was fond of this aspect of the Rakuyo, as she frowned upon blood blades, despite being a distant relative of the queen. 
        One day, she abandoned her beloved Rakuyo, casting it into a dark well, when she could stomach it no longer."
        
        
        
        Fishing Hamlet. Get to the bottom of the well. Can be reached from the underground tunnels at the end of the area or via a ladder in the well right away. In that area a Shark Giant will wander around. Fighting him makes a second one appear after the first reaches sufficiently low health. The first giant will walk over near the ladder and scream at the ceiling, causing the second one to drop. The second one drops the weapon.
        Fighting the two of them can be difficult and it is a good idea to use the Shaman Bone Blade to make them fight each other and finish off the weaker one. Molotov cocktails are also very effective against them. If neither is available to you, try to kill the one with the anchor first, as it is significantly harder to dodge.
        One easy way to beat them is use of ranged weapon like Simon's Bowblade if you are a bloodtinge build, and the Holy Moonlight Sword if you are an arcane build.
        A Threaded Cane's transformed whip can easily hit the giants from the ledge once they're lured over and begin attacking, but be sure to keep your distance after each hit. Except that there is no way to lure them over the the ledge. No ranged weapon will hit the one standing at the back and the one hanging from the ceiling doesn't drop down until the first one is at 50% health. 
        Unlike other giants in the game, these ones are easy to gun parry for a visceral attack. Keep in mind this will get very tricky after the other one starts fighting, so try to separate them and time your viscerals to get the invincibility at the right moment.
        If your range is inadequate you can use the monocular to angle a throwing knife to be able to hit the shark giant in the back. This way, you can continue from the strategy of killing them on the ledge with a gun/magic without going around. (confirmed as of January 19th, 2019)
        Chaining together backstabs is a very effecient way of dealing with them, if played right you should be able to eliminate the first shark giant before the second reaches you this way. It is extremely difficult to get behind the patrolling Shark Giant without him detecting you. 
        For a video showing an easy way to kill the sharks with a monocular and a throwing knife strategy, check .
        
        
        
        Rakuyo (ËêΩËëâ) literally means "falling leaf".
        The sword of Rakuyo bears resemblance to the "ky≈´ gunt≈ç", which was a hybrid of the sabre/katana with a handguard, used during the Russo-Japanese War.

        Reiterpallasch
        
        
        Weapon wielded by the Knights of Cainhurst. 
        Combines an elegant knight's sword with the peculiar firearm wielded by the Cainhurst order. 
        The old nobles, long-time imbibers of blood, are no strangers to the sanguine plague, and the disposal of beasts was a discrete task left to their servants, or knights, as they were called for the sake of appearances."
        
        
        
        It's found in a chest located in the entrance hall of Cainhurst Castle, where the Bound Widows are first encountered. When you first enter the room from the main entrance, run towards your two o'clock. The chest will be found in a corner.
        
        
        
        The Reiterpallasch (from German Reiter "horseback rider" and hungarian pallos [Ààp…ílo É] "sword") is a 17th century Hungarian straight sword with a typically double edged blade and guarded hilt that was used by Hungarian noble cavalry and later adapted by most western European armies.
        As pointed out in its description, the rifle spear is made "possibly in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon" (i.e. this one).
        Wynne D. Fanchon from Armored Core: For Answer; another From Software title, pilots a NEXT named Reiterpallasch.
        Relevant lore theories exist under The Mysteries of Cainhurst Garb and Architecture.

        Rifle Spear
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. A prototype weapon serving as a simple firearm and spear, possibly created in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon. Lacks any notable functions, saving that it is the only trick weapon with an attached gun. "
        
        
        
        It can be found inside a hidden building in Old Yharnam. From the area you fight the first NPC Hunter (who wields a saw spear), drop down where the railing is missing in a corner and land on the ledges below. Go into the building and follow the stairs up; eventually you can find it stashed on a corpse tucked away in a hidden nook as you advance.
        Bought from the messengers for 4000 blood echoes after acquiring the Powder Keg Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        According to the Rifle Spear's description, it was designed as an imitation of "a lost Cainhurst weapon".
        That particular weapon may or may not be the Reiterpallasch.
        It should be noted these two weapons are the only two skill/firearm hybrids whose alternate forms utilize guns.
        The third skill/firearm hybrid weapon in this game is Simon's Bowblade, which transforms from a sword into a bow.
        The Rifle Spear is carried by a Yahar'Gul Hunter in the Cathedral Ward.
        This fight can be tricky because you first encounter a Yahar'Gul Hunter that uses a Tonitrus near the base of the stairs, and if you advance too far towards the houses, the Rifle Spear Yahar'Gul Hunter will join the fight as well.
        He also uses Ludwig's Rifle, meaning he can hit you from a considerable distance with shotgun pellets no matter what mode he uses for the Rifle Spear.

        Saw Cleaver
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used in the hunting business. 
        This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts, transforms into a long cleaver that makes use of centrifugal force. 
        The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness the more grotesquely transformed the beast."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired as a gift from the Messengers the first time you visit the Hunter's Dream.
        If you don't select it, you may buy it after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne.)
        
        
        
        The Saw Cleaver is the Trick Weapon featured on the title screen.
        It was also one of the first weapons to be revealed for this game.
        Overall the mechanisms of this weapon didn't change at all, starting all the way back when Bloodborne was still known as "Project Beast."
        According to the concept art, the Saw Cleaver uses a trigger mechanism to unlock the joint during transformation.
        The design of the Saw Cleaver seems to be inspired by multiple references:
        The transformed cleaver shows a resemblance to LB-66 MOONLIGHT from Armored Core V.
        The Japanese name is written as "nokogiri nata" („Éé„Ç≥„ÇÆ„É™Èâà) or "saw hatchet". Nokogiri is a traditional Japanese saw that cuts from the pull stroke, as opposed to the more common push stroke.
        In real life, there is a type of cleaver known as a mezzaluna ("half moon") cleaver, known for chopping/mincing up various food products.
        Most of these types of cleavers have handles on both ends.
        However, some use a single handle that stretches across the blade, which was used to chop up herbs usually; the saw cleaver follows this particular model.
        Coincidentally, the Strength/Skill/Arcane scaling at maximum level is "CDC" in their respective order.
        The CDC is an American organization designed to combat and prevent "health threats" of varying natures.
        Since the beast scourge acts like a plague (and is spread due to blood-related reasons), those who wield the Saw Cleaver can be thought of as fighting a dangerous epidemic.
        Henryk uses this weapon when he fights you and Eileen the Crow during her questline, as well as when he is summoned by you when using the Old Hunter Bell.

        Simon despised firearms, and so the Church workshop had this specially fashioned to his liking. The large curved blade serves as a bow when transformed.
        But aside from a few close friends, Simon was scoffed at for his choice of arms, for who would dare face the beasts with a measly bow?"

        The stake driver, with its queerly complex design, violently drives thick stakes into the flesh of foes. 
        The stake driver allows for high-damage critical attacks, but is difficult to use and leaves its wielder wide open, but none of this should bother a mere Powder Keg."
        
        
        
        Obtain Powder Keg Hunter Badge to unlock for purchase at the Messengers for 8,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Stake Driver is exclusively wielded by Djura when he is still hostile towards you.
        His fight is tricky because the area around him is very limited, meaning you can fall to your death if you're not careful.
        Furthermore, the limited space is perfect for his choice of weapon which has a short range.
        This is modeled after the "Pile Bunker," a type of fictional weaponry which launches piston with gunpowder or explosion.
        In the Japanese version of Bloodborne, this weapon is literally called the Pile Hammer („Éë„Ç§„É´„Éè„É≥„Éû„Éº).
        It bears a striking resemblance to the "Parrying Blade" weapons seen in several "Armored Core" games.
        Has the highest charged attack multiplier out of any other weapon.

        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used on the hunt. Retains the qualities of an axe, but offers a wider palette of attacks by transforming. Boasts a heavy blunt attack, leading to high rally potential. No matter their pasts, beasts are no more than beasts. Some choose this axe to play the part of executioner."
        
        
        
        It's possible to pick this trick weapon as a starting weapon near the beginning of Bloodborne.
        If not chosen, it can instead be purchased from the Messengers after the Hunter has found the Saw Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is wielded by Father Gascoigne.
        However, he has a moveset that is different from the Hunter's version.
        He is also capable of using his unique Hunter Pistol even while his Hunter Axe is transformed, which is impossible for the Hunter to do.
        It's also wielded by the Madara's Twin who drops Madara's Whistle when defeated.
        Another hostile hunter NPC wields this trick weapon in the Nightmare Frontier.
        It's been heavily debated by the fanbase whether the transformed mode is a halberd or poleaxe.
        Both forms utilized axe heads with a spear tip at the end (although some poleaxes used hammer heads instead).
        However, neither weapon was known to have extendable handles, which is a special trademark of the Hunter Axe.
        In either case, it's possible this trick weapon was inspired by both weapons and simply incorporated many different designs.
        While wielded in it's transformed mode if the player had a torch equipped in the off-hand beasts afraid of the fire will still recoil in fear of you as if you were brandishing the torch normally (Tested on Beast Patient)

        Threaded Cane
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used by hunters on their duties. Sufficiently deadly as a rigid bladed cane, but also serves as a whip when its blade is split into many. Concealing the weapon inside the cane and flogging the beasts with the whip is partly an act of ceremony, an attempt to demonstrate to oneself that the bloodlust of the hunt will never encroach upon the soul."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired at the beginning of the game as a gift from the Messengers.
        If not selected, it is later available for purchase from the blood fountain messengers after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne).
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is used by Iosefka, Last Scholar Yurie and the Frontier Church Hunter.
        Gehrman carries a generic cane in the Workshop instead of the Threaded Cane.
        This trick weapon is possibly inspired by the sword used by Jean-Fran√ßois de Morangias in the climactic battle of French action-horror film Brotherhood of the Wolf (which bears many other similarities to Bloodborne), or the sword used by a bandit leader in the anime/manga series Claymore. Both these weapons act as a straight, double-edged sword that can transform into a segmented, bladed whip.

        Tonitrus
        
        
        "A unique trick weapon contrived by Archibald, the infamous eccentric of the Healing Church workshop. 
        Striking this peculiar iron morning star flail like a match generates the same blue sparks that blanket a darkbeast. 
        Unfortunately, for reasons untold, the hunters of Archibald's time did not fully take to the device."
        
        
        
        Acquire the Spark Hunter Badge by defeating Darkbeast Paarl  to purchase from Messengers.
        Treasure: Yahar'gul, Unseen Village, at the top end of the road. (guarded by 2 Tainted Dogs and a Snatcher during daytime)
        
        
        
        Tonitrus is a Latin word meaning "thunder."
        The in-game description classifies this trick weapon as a morning star flail, but it's actually modeled in the form of a mace.
        The description of Archibald bears many similarities to Nikola Tesla, a famed inventor in real life who specialized in the field of electricity.
        Nikola Tesla created the Tesla Coil, a device that also bears many similarities to the Tonitrus.
        The Tonitrus also bears similarities with the aspergillum, a device used by the Roman Catholic Church to sprinkle holy water.
        According to the description of the Spark Hunter Badge, Archibald was associated with the Healing Church.
        In this sense, it may have been designed under the themes of "purificiation" and "cleansing" that is associated with many Healing Church trick weapons/tools.
        However, due to Archibald's fascination with Dark Beasts, it's more likely he designed the Tonitrus as a measure to replicate the sparks these creatures could unleash.

        Whirligig Saw
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs, and weapon of choice of the Old Hunter Valtr, the Beast Eater. 
        This weapon pummels beasts in its mace form, but its true strength lies in its attached mechanical saws. 
        These discs, lined with serrated teeth,spin rapidly, thrashing the flesh of beasts into fine shreds."
        
        
        
        From the Nightmare Church go down the stairs and follow the path. Drop down into the pools of blood of follow the path further until you reach the Cannon Executioner. Follow the left wall and turn down the path, the weapon is at the end.
        
        
        
        If you use the L2 buzzsaw attack against Orphan of Kos and hold it in place, it attempts to make an immediate counterattack for each time it gets hit by the whirring blades, only to get interrupted by the next hit. It shrieks every time it attacks, so as a result, it lets loose dozens of overlapping shriek sound effects for as long as you hold it in place.
        A whirligig is defined as a toy that is constantly spinning, such as a top or pinwheel, or as something regarded as hectic and constantly changing.
        Similar to most Powder Keg weapons sharing homage to Armored Core weapons, the Whirligig Saw is based on the Grind Blade.
        
    

        Kirkhammer
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. On the one side, an easily handled silver sword. On the other, a giant obtuse stone weapon, characterized by a blunt strike and extreme force of impact. The Church takes a heavy-handed, merciless stance toward the plague of beasts, an irony not lost upon the wielders of this most symbolic weapon."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers after acquiring the Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        A miniature of the Kirkhammer was included as the Pre-Order Bonus for Asian editions of Bloodborne. [See the Bundles page for details]
        A "kirk" is an archaic old english word meaning "church."
        This means the weapon is literately known as the Church Hammer.
        The wording also might be a nod to Nordic culture since the word "Kirk" originated from northern England and Old Norse wording.
        The etched wording on the side of the hammer part has similarities to the Old Norse alphabet.
        However, it also has similarities to the Elder Futhark, one of the oldest forms of the runic alphabet system used by Germanic tribes.
        Similar etchings can be found on gravestones all over Yharnam.
        The sword used for this weapon is very similar to the one used for Ludwig's Holy Blade.
        This suggests that the Healing Church used the method of "interchangeable parts" to efficiently mass produce weapons for their hunters.
        However, the sword used for the Kirkhammer is shorter.
        It's wielded by Alfred, should you choose to be friends with him.
        He uses this weapon as a summon.
        However, he wields the Logarius' Wheel if you find him in Cainhurst Castle under special circumstances.
        When untransformed, with the hammer part on the character's back, some cloth parts (capes etc.) of the armor can either get awkwardly stuck on it or cover it.
        Despite being labeled a 'stone weapon', the etchings, wear, and sound produced when it strikes indicate that the hammer is in fact made of metal.

        Amygdalan Arm 
        
        
        The arm of a small Amygdala Great One. 
        Strictly speaking, the Amygdalan Arm is no trick weapon of any sort, but certain madmen wield them like clubs. 
        Starts as a large, tough blunt weapon formed of bone, but when extended, the hand quivers as if it were still alive.
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare, cave at the end of the blood river to the right after getting out of the building that used to be the shortcut to the Cleric Beast in the main game. Gatling Gun Hunter dropping the Gatling Gun and a Blood-Starved Beast can be also found here. Arm is near the Blood-Starved Beast at the end of the cave.
        
        
        
        The Amygdalan Arm is a Trick Weapon in name only, considering that it is an arm obtained from Amygdala.
        The arm is remarkably small, as even the Lesser Amygdalae are huge. Perhaps it came from a newborn Amygdala.
        The arm could be the inspiration behind the Burial Blade.

        Beastly weapon wielded by Irreverent Izzy.
        Crafted by chiseling the long bones of an undead darkbeast and fastening them to the weapon. The bones are still alive, and when unleashed, grant its wielder a spurt of beastly power. 
        As flesh is flayed and blood is sprayed, the beast within awakens, and in time, the wielder of this weapon surges with both strength and feverish reverie."

        Can be bought from messengers for 34000 echoes after acquisition.
        Can be bought from messengers after co-operation with player who has them. This only occurs in Hunter's dream before fight with Gehrman or Moon Presence. It is not needed to complete any Chalice Dungeons. It is unknown if this is glitch or intentional. Was patched by 1.07 or 1.08.
        
        
        
        When this weapon is equipped, your gloves will be replaced by two bone gauntlets. This can allow for the lost art of rapid glove changing if you switch your weapons really fast.
        You can charge the beasthood meter on the first windows (Gilbert) of Central Yharnam
        In the past, there was a rare glitch that allowed a player to obtain this weapon without finding it in the Chalice Dungeons.
        It has since been patched, although it isn't quite known when it was successfully patched.

        A second blade is found inside the curve of the main one. In its initial form, the saif can be wielded like a long curved sword, but when transformed, its blade is contracted, allowing for quick, repeated stabs. 
        Although this trick weapon allows for adaptive combat, it was later replaced by saws and similar weapons that were more effective at disposing of beasts."

        This thick iron cleaver slices through the toughest of beast hides, and when transformed the blade splits into sections, allowing one to lash it in the fashion of a heavy whip. 
        This crude weapon relies on brute force and is regrettably inelegant, suggesting that the hunts of the earliest hunters made for horrific affairs, painted in sanguine black and reds."

        Reminds many of the Zanpakut≈ç , a fictional segmented sword that can function as a whip. It is an iconic weapon from the Bleach anime.

        Splits into two when activated. The weapon's warped blades are forged with siderite, a rare mineral of the heavens. Most effective swift attacks,such as after a quick-stepping."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers for 40000 echoes after obtaining the Crow Hunter Badge from Eileen the Crow's quest line.
        Killing Eileen is also a way to get the weapon early in the game.
        While progressing through Eileen's quest, it's possible for her to be killed by Henryk and thus drop the Crow Hunter Badge as a result, although the quest line will end.
        
        
        
        The Blade of Mercy was originally named as "Warped Twinblades" during the Alpha test, and it was the tool of choice for the "agile" hunter.
        Both the Burial Blade and Blade of Mercy make mentions of a mineral known as siderite in their descriptions.
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite, and it seems to be the reason why arcane power has direct scaling with both blade's damage output. Due to its extraterrestrial origins, that may explain why it cannot be buffed by an external source of any sort.
        It loosely resembles the Eleum Loyce from Dark Souls 2, a sword with two blades at the front.
        
        
    

        Kirkhammer
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. On the one side, an easily handled silver sword. On the other, a giant obtuse stone weapon, characterized by a blunt strike and extreme force of impact. The Church takes a heavy-handed, merciless stance toward the plague of beasts, an irony not lost upon the wielders of this most symbolic weapon."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers after acquiring the Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        A miniature of the Kirkhammer was included as the Pre-Order Bonus for Asian editions of Bloodborne. [See the Bundles page for details]
        A "kirk" is an archaic old english word meaning "church."
        This means the weapon is literately known as the Church Hammer.
        The wording also might be a nod to Nordic culture since the word "Kirk" originated from northern England and Old Norse wording.
        The etched wording on the side of the hammer part has similarities to the Old Norse alphabet.
        However, it also has similarities to the Elder Futhark, one of the oldest forms of the runic alphabet system used by Germanic tribes.
        Similar etchings can be found on gravestones all over Yharnam.
        The sword used for this weapon is very similar to the one used for Ludwig's Holy Blade.
        This suggests that the Healing Church used the method of "interchangeable parts" to efficiently mass produce weapons for their hunters.
        However, the sword used for the Kirkhammer is shorter.
        It's wielded by Alfred, should you choose to be friends with him.
        He uses this weapon as a summon.
        However, he wields the Logarius' Wheel if you find him in Cainhurst Castle under special circumstances.
        When untransformed, with the hammer part on the character's back, some cloth parts (capes etc.) of the armor can either get awkwardly stuck on it or cover it.
        Despite being labeled a 'stone weapon', the etchings, wear, and sound produced when it strikes indicate that the hammer is in fact made of metal.

        Bloodletter
        
        
        The demented hunter weapon brandished by Brador, the Healing Church assassin. 
        The Bloodletter assumes its true and terrifying form after it draws upon blood from the inner reaches of one's body and soul. 
        This is the only effective means of expelling tainted blood, or so Brador, isolated in his cell, continued to believe."
        
        
        
        Obtain the underground cell inner chamber key.
        Return to the underground prison (from the underground corpse pile lamp, go up the stairs and turn left) and open the door to Brador's cell. His cell is the second on the left behind a flight of downward stairs. Kill Brador to obtain the bloodletter.
        Brador will not be hostile in his cell, but will invade the player right outside his cell.

        Boom Hammer
        
        
        A trick weapon used by the old hunters, and crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. 
        A giant hammer equipped with a miniature furnace. When ignited and fired, it emits a volley of flame that explodes furiously upon impact. 
        Crush the beasts, then burn them - the brute simplicity of the Boom Hammer was favored by hunters with an acute distaste for beasts."

Be sure to shoot the explosives around the item (or act fast), as the wheelchair huntsman's corpse conceals a delayed molotov set to trigger when you try to grab the Boom Hammer, potential killing you in a huge blast.
        
        
        
        When the Boomhammer is lit, Beast Patient mobs will back away from the player as if they had a torch equipped. (May need to initiate primed attack first)

        Burial Blade
        
        
        Trick weapon wielded by Gehrman, the first hunter." 
        A masterpiece that defined the entire array of weapons crafted at the workshop. Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens. 
        Gehrman surely saw the hunt as a dirge of farewell, wishing only that his prey might rest in peace, never again to awaken to another harrowing nightmare. "
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 60,000 Blood Echoes after defeating Gehrman, the First Hunter and acquiring the Old Hunter Badge from him.
        To make Gehrman fight you, the "Refuse" option must be selected.
        If one accepts his proposal, the game will outright end there and it will be impossible to obtain this weapon in that playthrough (not including the uncanny/lost forms found in the chalice dungeons).
        Normally, the Burial Blade can only be obtained in NG+ and beyond. However, one can bypass this by using Bold Hunter's Mark, or being killed, during The Moon Presence boss battle.
        
        
        
         The Burial Blade was the first trick weapon ever created, and it inspired others to develop new trick weapons, usually on the premise of adapting to different combat scenerios.
        Not all weapons adapt to different combat scenerios (e.g. Tonitrus), but the Burial Blade still inspired an entire series of weapons that could "transform" to satisfy different purposes.
        It was created, and exclusively wielded, by Gehrman.
        A Burial Blade can be found above the workshop table in the Hunter's Dream.
        The weapon's description mentions that "Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens."
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite. Due to its extraterrestrial nature, it could be the reason why it has direct scaling with arcane and cannot be tampered by external sources.
        Both the Burial Blade and the Blade of Mercy mentions the use of it in their descriptions.
        Interestingly enough, these two weapons also resemble the talons of Mergo's Wet Nurse.
        The shape of the scythe highly resembles Rurufon's scythe from Shadow Tower Abyss, an early title created by From Software as well as being recurring weapons in Souls series.
        A strange bug on rare occurrences the cape on the hunter may come off, usually in a boss fight you could notice if you dodge back and do an R1 combo the cape disappears. [Note, I haven't seen this happen in a while, it's possible that it may have been fixed, but I'll need confirmation on this]

        Chikage
        
        
        Foreign-made weapon wielded by the royal guards who protect Annalise, Queen of the Vilebloods at Cainhurst Castle. 
        When the intricate, rippled engraving that spans the Chikage's blade is imbrued with blood, the sword sings in scarlet hues. 
        However, the rite eats away at the wielder's very essence."
        
        
        
        Join the Cainhurst Vilebloods covenant available at Cainhurst Castle, and then purchase from the Messengers for 50,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Chikage isn't actually a katana - it is a katana/european sword hybrid. Its short crossguard resembles the one of an early viking sword, or the one of a xiphos (greek sword). The closest european crossguard shape with  this sword is the one of a Karabela (a polish sabre). In other hand, the  hilt and pommel resemble the ones of a longsword (a bit longer, to get easier katana traditional jutsu swings), while the blade shape and the 2-handed fighting style is very similar to a katana. A possible explanation for the origin of this hybrid is that the katana's design was imported to Cainhurst, where some modifications were made to create a sword similar to that commonly used by their knights.
        The Chikage is an allusion to a particular 'breed' of Katanas in the Souls games. While it is similar to both the Hiltless and Chaos Blade from Demon's Souls and Dark Souls respectively, the Chikage bears a stronger resemblance to the Magic Sword "Makoto" (also from Demon's Souls). The Makoto is the only one the bunch to actually DRAIN the user's HP over time, rather than decrease it with each successful swing.
        Chikage (ÂçÉÊôØ) literally means "Thousands Views", however if you separated the word into Chi Kage (Ë°ÄÂΩ±), it means "Blood Shadow". This could be correlated to the fact that Shadows Of Yharnam wield a similar katana with a slight  crossguard, however without using the bloodtinge.
        The transforming attack has the hunter sheathe the Chikage before unleashing a strike. This is a reference to Iaijutsu, a traditional Japanese sword technique that focuses on quick-drawing. At its finest, Iaijutse allows the warrior to unsheathe and strike at incredible speeds.
        The name seems to be a tribute to Chikage Yamamura (mentioned as a "special thanks" in credits)
        The name may also be a reference to the work "1000 Plateaus" by Giles Deluze and Felix Guattari, a famous philosophical essay about fluidity and functionality, maybe dirrectly tied to the esoteric nature of the weapons function.

        Church Pick
        
        
        One of the old trick weapons of the Healing Church, a hunting weapon formed from one of the giant picks that appear in old beast tales. 
        The Church Pick initially serves as a large sword, but when transformed functions as an extended war pick. In spite of its origins, it is a highly practical weapon."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Dropped by a hunter wearing Yahar'Gul set (presumably, this is the summonable Old Hunter Defector Antal) in one of the cells that you open with the Underground Cell Key from the Research Hall. To make this battle simple, attack him through the door with a strong R2 attack, then leave the room. He will lose sight of you and his AI will return to a standstill behind the door. Rinse and repeat until dead.
        
        
        
        The Church Pick And The Hunter's Axe both have similar appearance. When transformed, both are wielded as a polearm and have the same de-transformation attack. The only difference apart from the Church Pick having a slightly more complicated mechanism is that the Hunter's Axe is a strength-based weapon.
        A few of its attacks in the transformed mode are very similar to that of the Burial Blade.

        Holy Moonlight Sword
        
        
        An arcane sword discovered long ago by Ludwig. 
        When blue moonlight dances around the sword, and it channels the abyssal cosmos, its great blade will hurl a shadowy lightwave. 
        The Holy Moonlight Sword is synonymous with Ludwig, the Holy Blade, but few have ever set eyes on the great blade, and whatever guidance it has to offer, it seems to be of a very private, elusive sort."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Found on the Underground Corpse Pile after the fight against Ludwig, The Holy Blade. Ludwig's head will be lying there and you can:
        Kill the head for the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and talk to the head. When prompted, reply "Yes" and you'll get the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and reply "No", then come back later and Simon the Harrowed will be there and give you the sword.
        NOTE: This weapon is missable. If Lawrence is killed before you obtain it, you will no longer be able to talk to the head or obtain it from Simon.
        
        
        
        It seems to be another reappearance of the Moonlight Greatsword, a recurring item found around FromSoftware's games. Notable examples of such games include the first, second and third Dark Souls games, Demon's Souls, King's Field, Ninja Blade, Enchanted Arms, Armored Core, 3D Dot Game Heroes, and Otogi.
        Lore theories exist under "Ebrietas Lore".

        Hunter Axe
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used on the hunt. Retains the qualities of an axe, but offers a wider palette of attacks by transforming. Boasts a heavy blunt attack, leading to high rally potential. No matter their pasts, beasts are no more than beasts. Some choose this axe to play the part of executioner."
        
        
        
        It's possible to pick this trick weapon as a starting weapon near the beginning of Bloodborne.
        If not chosen, it can instead be purchased from the Messengers after the Hunter has found the Saw Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is wielded by Father Gascoigne.
        However, he has a moveset that is different from the Hunter's version.
        He is also capable of using his unique Hunter Pistol even while his Hunter Axe is transformed, which is impossible for the Hunter to do.
        It's also wielded by the Madara's Twin who drops Madara's Whistle when defeated.
        Another hostile hunter NPC wields this trick weapon in the Nightmare Frontier.
        It's been heavily debated by the fanbase whether the transformed mode is a halberd or poleaxe.
        Both forms utilized axe heads with a spear tip at the end (although some poleaxes used hammer heads instead).
        However, neither weapon was known to have extendable handles, which is a special trademark of the Hunter Axe.
        In either case, it's possible this trick weapon was inspired by both weapons and simply incorporated many different designs.
        While wielded in it's transformed mode if the player had a torch equipped in the off-hand beasts afraid of the fire will still recoil in fear of you as if you were brandishing the torch normally (Tested on Beast Patient)
        
        
    

        Kirkhammer
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. On the one side, an easily handled silver sword.

        A "kirk" is an archaic old english word meaning "church."

        Kos Parasite
        
        
        When the carcass of Kos washed up on the coast, its insides were teeming with tiny parasites, unlike any found in humans. 
        This atypical weapon can only be clasped tight and swung, but a Kos Parasite is said to stimulate phantasms inhabiting a lumenwood"
        
        
        
        Dropped by Orphan of Kos
        
        
        
        The Kos Parasite is perhaps the most interestingly unique weapon in Bloodborne in various ways: It is one of two weapons that can reach it's full potential while using a rune (the other being Beast Claw), the weapon itself is not held, it is purely an arcane weapon, it is the only weapon directly dropped by defeating a boss, it has the highest durability of any weapon at 600 respectively, it is the only weapon to have an A-scaling of any weapon without any upgrades and is the only weapon to have an S-scaling by upgrading it twice.

        Logarius's Wheel
        
        
        "Weapon wielded by martyr Logarius' band of executioners. 
        Used to slaughter the Vilebloods in Cainhurst. Bathed in pools of their blood, and forever steeped in their ire. 
        Transform to release the power of the wheel and manifest their lingering rage in a show of utter brilliance."
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 13,000 Blood Echoes after acquiring the Wheel Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        Alfred utilizes the Logarius' Wheel when found in Cainhurst Castle.
        This weapon is yet another reference to Berserk, as they are often made in Miyazaki's previous Souls games.
        "Logarius and his band of executioners" bear many similarities to Mozgus, an insanely devout man who traveled the land torturing heretics along with his disciples.
        The wheel in particular was wielded by one of his six disciples, .
        In Dark Souls, Bonewheel Skeletons are another reference to Mozgus' disciples.
        In real life, although wheels weren't typically wielded as weapons, they were commonly used as torture devices, especially during the Middle Ages.
        Torture wheels were nicknamed "breaking wheels," since victims often times would have their limbs broken during the process.
        They were also known as "catherine wheels."
         It's quite possible that Logarius' Wheel also takes some inspiration in its use as a weapon from the English folklore legend of Tom Hickathrift. Tom was a fabled giant killer who made use of a cartwheel to vanquish the Wisbech Giant (also referred to as an ogre).
        Lore theories can be found under "From Berserk to Bloodborne".

        Ludwig's Holy Blade
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. It is said that the silver sword was employed by Ludwig, the first hunter of the church. When transformed, it combines with its sheath to form a greatsword. 
        It exhibits several departures from the workshop's design, suggesting that the Church anticipated much larger inhuman beasts."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased for 20,000 echoes from the Messengers after obtaining the Radiant Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon was wielded by Ludwig, a famous hunter of the Healing Church who designed the blade based on the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        According to the description, Ludwig wielded this sword in combat instead of the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        However, in his boss fight, he wields the Holy Moonlight Sword during a certain part in the fight.
        It is possible that Ludwig wielded the Holy Moonlight Sword and his fellow hunters, inspired by the huge weapon, sought to make replicas. Unable to make a magic sword, a huge metal sheath was the compromise.
        Before the DLC's release, Ludwig's Holy Blade was thought of as From Software's traditional "Moonlight Greatsword" seen throughout various games by the fanbase.
        However, this sword was eventually revealed in the DLC to be a replica of the "true" Moonlight Greatsword in Bloodborne, the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        This isn't the first time Miyazaki used the name of classical music composers in a game.
        A boss from the first "Dark Souls" game, Dragonslayer Ornstein, is named after Leo Ornstein.
        Berlioz from "Armored Core 4" is named after Hector Berlioz.
        The normal form of this weapon is very similar to the sword used for the Kirkhammer.
        However, this sword's normal form has a slightly longer reach when compared to the Kirkhammer's blade.
        The similar nature of these swords suggests that the Healing Church used the method of interchangeable parts to quickly mass produce weapons for their hunters.
        Lore theories exist under Ebrietas Lore.

        Rakuyo
        
        
        Hunter weapon wielded by Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower. 
        A trick sword originated in the same country as the Cainhurst Chikage, only this sword feeds not off blood, but instead demands great dexterity. 
        Lady Maria was fond of this aspect of the Rakuyo, as she frowned upon blood blades, despite being a distant relative of the queen. 
        One day, she abandoned her beloved Rakuyo, casting it into a dark well, when she could stomach it no longer."
        
        
        
        Fishing Hamlet. Get to the bottom of the well. Can be reached from the underground tunnels at the end of the area or via a ladder in the well right away. In that area a Shark Giant will wander around. Fighting him makes a second one appear after the first reaches sufficiently low health. The first giant will walk over near the ladder and scream at the ceiling, causing the second one to drop. The second one drops the weapon.
        Fighting the two of them can be difficult and it is a good idea to use the Shaman Bone Blade to make them fight each other and finish off the weaker one. Molotov cocktails are also very effective against them. If neither is available to you, try to kill the one with the anchor first, as it is significantly harder to dodge.
        One easy way to beat them is use of ranged weapon like Simon's Bowblade if you are a bloodtinge build, and the Holy Moonlight Sword if you are an arcane build.
        A Threaded Cane's transformed whip can easily hit the giants from the ledge once they're lured over and begin attacking, but be sure to keep your distance after each hit. Except that there is no way to lure them over the the ledge. No ranged weapon will hit the one standing at the back and the one hanging from the ceiling doesn't drop down until the first one is at 50% health. 
        Unlike other giants in the game, these ones are easy to gun parry for a visceral attack. Keep in mind this will get very tricky after the other one starts fighting, so try to separate them and time your viscerals to get the invincibility at the right moment.
        If your range is inadequate you can use the monocular to angle a throwing knife to be able to hit the shark giant in the back. This way, you can continue from the strategy of killing them on the ledge with a gun/magic without going around. (confirmed as of January 19th, 2019)
        Chaining together backstabs is a very effecient way of dealing with them, if played right you should be able to eliminate the first shark giant before the second reaches you this way. It is extremely difficult to get behind the patrolling Shark Giant without him detecting you. 
        For a video showing an easy way to kill the sharks with a monocular and a throwing knife strategy, check .
        
        
        
        Rakuyo (ËêΩËëâ) literally means "falling leaf".
        The sword of Rakuyo bears resemblance to the "ky≈´ gunt≈ç", which was a hybrid of the sabre/katana with a handguard, used during the Russo-Japanese War.

        The Reiterpallasch (from German Reiter "horseback rider" and hungarian pallos [Ààp…ílo É] "sword") is a 17th century Hungarian straight sword with a typically double edged blade and guarded hilt that was used by Hungarian noble cavalry and later adapted by most western European armies.
        As pointed out in its description, the rifle spear is made "possibly in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon" (i.e. this one).
        Wynne D. Fanchon from Armored Core: For Answer; another From Software title, pilots a NEXT named Reiterpallasch.
        Relevant lore theories exist under The Mysteries of Cainhurst Garb and Architecture.
        
        
    

        Kirkhammer
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. On the one side, an easily handled silver sword. On the other, a giant obtuse stone weapon, characterized by a blunt strike and extreme force of impact. The Church takes a heavy-handed, merciless stance toward the plague of beasts, an irony not lost upon the wielders of this most symbolic weapon."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers after acquiring the Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        A miniature of the Kirkhammer was included as the Pre-Order Bonus for Asian editions of Bloodborne. [See the Bundles page for details]
        A "kirk" is an archaic old english word meaning "church."
        This means the weapon is literately known as the Church Hammer.
        The wording also might be a nod to Nordic culture since the word "Kirk" originated from northern England and Old Norse wording.
        The etched wording on the side of the hammer part has similarities to the Old Norse alphabet.
        However, it also has similarities to the Elder Futhark, one of the oldest forms of the runic alphabet system used by Germanic tribes.
        Similar etchings can be found on gravestones all over Yharnam.
        The sword used for this weapon is very similar to the one used for Ludwig's Holy Blade.
        This suggests that the Healing Church used the method of "interchangeable parts" to efficiently mass produce weapons for their hunters.
        However, the sword used for the Kirkhammer is shorter.
        It's wielded by Alfred, should you choose to be friends with him.
        He uses this weapon as a summon.
        However, he wields the Logarius' Wheel if you find him in Cainhurst Castle under special circumstances.
        When untransformed, with the hammer part on the character's back, some cloth parts (capes etc.) of the armor can either get awkwardly stuck on it or cover it.
        Despite being labeled a 'stone weapon', the etchings, wear, and sound produced when it strikes indicate that the hammer is in fact made of metal.

        Rifle Spear
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. A prototype weapon serving as a simple firearm and spear, possibly created in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon. Lacks any notable functions, saving that it is the only trick weapon with an attached gun. "
        
        
        
        It can be found inside a hidden building in Old Yharnam. From the area you fight the first NPC Hunter (who wields a saw spear), drop down where the railing is missing in a corner and land on the ledges below. Go into the building and follow the stairs up; eventually you can find it stashed on a corpse tucked away in a hidden nook as you advance.
        Bought from the messengers for 4000 blood echoes after acquiring the Powder Keg Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        According to the Rifle Spear's description, it was designed as an imitation of "a lost Cainhurst weapon".
        That particular weapon may or may not be the Reiterpallasch.
        It should be noted these two weapons are the only two skill/firearm hybrids whose alternate forms utilize guns.
        The third skill/firearm hybrid weapon in this game is Simon's Bowblade, which transforms from a sword into a bow.
        The Rifle Spear is carried by a Yahar'Gul Hunter in the Cathedral Ward.
        This fight can be tricky because you first encounter a Yahar'Gul Hunter that uses a Tonitrus near the base of the stairs, and if you advance too far towards the houses, the Rifle Spear Yahar'Gul Hunter will join the fight as well.
        He also uses Ludwig's Rifle, meaning he can hit you from a considerable distance with shotgun pellets no matter what mode he uses for the Rifle Spear.

        Saw Cleaver
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used in the hunting business. 
        This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts, transforms into a long cleaver that makes use of centrifugal force. 
        The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness the more grotesquely transformed the beast."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired as a gift from the Messengers the first time you visit the Hunter's Dream.
        If you don't select it, you may buy it after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne.)
        
        
        
        The Saw Cleaver is the Trick Weapon featured on the title screen.
        It was also one of the first weapons to be revealed for this game.
        Overall the mechanisms of this weapon didn't change at all, starting all the way back when Bloodborne was still known as "Project Beast."
        According to the concept art, the Saw Cleaver uses a trigger mechanism to unlock the joint during transformation.
        The design of the Saw Cleaver seems to be inspired by multiple references:
        The transformed cleaver shows a resemblance to LB-66 MOONLIGHT from Armored Core V.
        The Japanese name is written as "nokogiri nata" („Éé„Ç≥„ÇÆ„É™Èâà) or "saw hatchet". Nokogiri is a traditional Japanese saw that cuts from the pull stroke, as opposed to the more common push stroke.
        In real life, there is a type of cleaver known as a mezzaluna ("half moon") cleaver, known for chopping/mincing up various food products.
        Most of these types of cleavers have handles on both ends.
        However, some use a single handle that stretches across the blade, which was used to chop up herbs usually; the saw cleaver follows this particular model.
        Coincidentally, the Strength/Skill/Arcane scaling at maximum level is "CDC" in their respective order.
        The CDC is an American organization designed to combat and prevent "health threats" of varying natures.
        Since the beast scourge acts like a plague (and is spread due to blood-related reasons), those who wield the Saw Cleaver can be thought of as fighting a dangerous epidemic.
        Henryk uses this weapon when he fights you and Eileen the Crow during her questline, as well as when he is summoned by you when using the Old Hunter Bell.

        Can be bought from the Bath Messengers, after obtaining the Saw Hunter Badge, for 1,000 Blood Echoes.

        Choice weapon of Simon, one of the first Healing Church hunters.
        Simon despised firearms, and so the Church workshop had this specially fashioned to his liking. The large curved blade serves as a bow when transformed.
        But aside from a few close friends, Simon was scoffed at for his choice of arms, for who would dare face the beasts with a measly bow?"

        Stake Driver

        The stake driver, with its queerly complex design, violently drives thick stakes into the flesh of foes. 
        The stake driver allows for high-damage critical attacks, but is difficult to use and leaves its wielder wide open, but none of this should bother a mere Powder Keg."
        
        
        
        Obtain Powder Keg Hunter Badge to unlock for purchase at the Messengers for 8,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Stake Driver is exclusively wielded by Djura when he is still hostile towards you.
        His fight is tricky because the area around him is very limited, meaning you can fall to your death if you're not careful.
        Furthermore, the limited space is perfect for his choice of weapon which has a short range.
        This is modeled after the "Pile Bunker," a type of fictional weaponry which launches piston with gunpowder or explosion.
        In the Japanese version of Bloodborne, this weapon is literally called the Pile Hammer („Éë„Ç§„É´„Éè„É≥„Éû„Éº).
        It bears a striking resemblance to the "Parrying Blade" weapons seen in several "Armored Core" games.
        Has the highest charged attack multiplier out of any other weapon.

        Threaded Cane
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used by hunters on their duties. Sufficiently deadly as a rigid bladed cane, but also serves as a whip when its blade is split into many. Concealing the weapon inside the cane and flogging the beasts with the whip is partly an act of ceremony, an attempt to demonstrate to oneself that the bloodlust of the hunt will never encroach upon the soul."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired at the beginning of the game as a gift from the Messengers.
        If not selected, it is later available for purchase from the blood fountain messengers after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne).
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is used by Iosefka, Last Scholar Yurie and the Frontier Church Hunter.
        Gehrman carries a generic cane in the Workshop instead of the Threaded Cane.
        This trick weapon is possibly inspired by the sword used by Jean-Fran√ßois de Morangias in the climactic battle of French action-horror film Brotherhood of the Wolf (which bears many other similarities to Bloodborne), or the sword used by a bandit leader in the anime/manga series Claymore. Both these weapons act as a straight, double-edged sword that can transform into a segmented, bladed whip.

        Tonitrus is a Latin word meaning "thunder."
        The in-game description classifies this trick weapon as a morning star flail, but it's actually modeled in the form of a mace.
        The description of Archibald bears many similarities to Nikola Tesla, a famed inventor in real life who specialized in the field of electricity.
        Nikola Tesla created the Tesla Coil, a device that also bears many similarities to the Tonitrus.
        The Tonitrus also bears similarities with the aspergillum, a device used by the Roman Catholic Church to sprinkle holy water.
        According to the description of the Spark Hunter Badge, Archibald was associated with the Healing Church.
        In this sense, it may have been designed under the themes of "purificiation" and "cleansing" that is associated with many Healing Church trick weapons/tools.
        However, due to Archibald's fascination with Dark Beasts, it's more likely he designed the Tonitrus as a measure to replicate the sparks these creatures could unleash.
        
        
    

        Kirkhammer
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. On the one side, an easily handled silver sword. On the other, a giant obtuse stone weapon, characterized by a blunt strike and extreme force of impact. The Church takes a heavy-handed, merciless stance toward the plague of beasts, an irony not lost upon the wielders of this most symbolic weapon."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers after acquiring the Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        A miniature of the Kirkhammer was included as the Pre-Order Bonus for Asian editions of Bloodborne. [See the Bundles page for details]
        A "kirk" is an archaic old english word meaning "church."
        This means the weapon is literately known as the Church Hammer.
        The wording also might be a nod to Nordic culture since the word "Kirk" originated from northern England and Old Norse wording.
        The etched wording on the side of the hammer part has similarities to the Old Norse alphabet.
        However, it also has similarities to the Elder Futhark, one of the oldest forms of the runic alphabet system used by Germanic tribes.
        Similar etchings can be found on gravestones all over Yharnam.
        The sword used for this weapon is very similar to the one used for Ludwig's Holy Blade.
        This suggests that the Healing Church used the method of "interchangeable parts" to efficiently mass produce weapons for their hunters.
        However, the sword used for the Kirkhammer is shorter.
        It's wielded by Alfred, should you choose to be friends with him.
        He uses this weapon as a summon.
        However, he wields the Logarius' Wheel if you find him in Cainhurst Castle under special circumstances.
        When untransformed, with the hammer part on the character's back, some cloth parts (capes etc.) of the armor can either get awkwardly stuck on it or cover it.
        Despite being labeled a 'stone weapon', the etchings, wear, and sound produced when it strikes indicate that the hammer is in fact made of metal.

        Whirligig Saw
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs, and weapon of choice of the Old Hunter Valtr, the Beast Eater. 
        This weapon pummels beasts in its mace form, but its true strength lies in its attached mechanical saws. 
        These discs, lined with serrated teeth,spin rapidly, thrashing the flesh of beasts into fine shreds."
        
        
        
        From the Nightmare Church go down the stairs and follow the path. Drop down into the pools of blood of follow the path further until you reach the Cannon Executioner. Follow the left wall and turn down the path, the weapon is at the end.
        
        
        
        If you use the L2 buzzsaw attack against Orphan of Kos and hold it in place, it attempts to make an immediate counterattack for each time it gets hit by the whirring blades, only to get interrupted by the next hit. It shrieks every time it attacks, so as a result, it lets loose dozens of overlapping shriek sound effects for as long as you hold it in place.
        A whirligig is defined as a toy that is constantly spinning, such as a top or pinwheel, or as something regarded as hectic and constantly changing.
        Similar to most Powder Keg weapons sharing homage to Armored Core weapons, the Whirligig Saw is based on the Grind Blade.
        
    

        Kos Parasite
        
        
        When the carcass of Kos washed up on the coast, its insides were teeming with tiny parasites, unlike any found in humans. 
        This atypical weapon can only be clasped tight and swung, but a Kos Parasite is said to stimulate phantasms inhabiting a lumenwood"
        
        
        
        Dropped by Orphan of Kos
        
        
        
        The Kos Parasite is perhaps the most interestingly unique weapon in Bloodborne in various ways: It is one of two weapons that can reach it's full potential while using a rune (the other being Beast Claw), the weapon itself is not held, it is purely an arcane weapon, it is the only weapon directly dropped by defeating a boss, it has the highest durability of any weapon at 600 respectively, it is the only weapon to have an A-scaling of any weapon without any upgrades and is the only weapon to have an S-scaling by upgrading it twice.

        Amygdalan Arm 
        
        
        The arm of a small Amygdala Great One. 
        Strictly speaking, the Amygdalan Arm is no trick weapon of any sort, but certain madmen wield them like clubs. 
        Starts as a large, tough blunt weapon formed of bone, but when extended, the hand quivers as if it were still alive.
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare, cave at the end of the blood river to the right after getting out of the building that used to be the shortcut to the Cleric Beast in the main game. Gatling Gun Hunter dropping the Gatling Gun and a Blood-Starved Beast can be also found here. Arm is near the Blood-Starved Beast at the end of the cave.
        
        
        
        The Amygdalan Arm is a Trick Weapon in name only, considering that it is an arm obtained from Amygdala.
        The arm is remarkably small, as even the Lesser Amygdalae are huge. Perhaps it came from a newborn Amygdala.
        The arm could be the inspiration behind the Burial Blade.

        Beast Claw
        
        
        Beastly weapon wielded by Irreverent Izzy.
        Crafted by chiseling the long bones of an undead darkbeast and fastening them to the weapon. The bones are still alive, and when unleashed, grant its wielder a spurt of beastly power. 
        As flesh is flayed and blood is sprayed, the beast within awakens, and in time, the wielder of this weapon surges with both strength and feverish reverie."
        
        
        
        Ailing Loran Chalice: Layer 2 treasure room. Room is on the right when exiting the elevator from first layer boss fight, before the second layers lantern.
        Can be bought from messengers for 34000 echoes after acquisition.
        Can be bought from messengers after co-operation with player who has them. This only occurs in Hunter's dream before fight with Gehrman or Moon Presence. It is not needed to complete any Chalice Dungeons. It is unknown if this is glitch or intentional. Was patched by 1.07 or 1.08.
        
        
        
        When this weapon is equipped, your gloves will be replaced by two bone gauntlets. This can allow for the lost art of rapid glove changing if you switch your weapons really fast.
        You can charge the beasthood meter on the first windows (Gilbert) of Central Yharnam
        In the past, there was a rare glitch that allowed a player to obtain this weapon without finding it in the Chalice Dungeons.
        It has since been patched, although it isn't quite known when it was successfully patched.

        Beasthunter Saif
        
        
        A trick weapon used by the old hunters. 
        A second blade is found inside the curve of the main one. In its initial form, the saif can be wielded like a long curved sword, but when transformed, its blade is contracted, allowing for quick, repeated stabs. 
        Although this trick weapon allows for adaptive combat, it was later replaced by saws and similar weapons that were more effective at disposing of beasts."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare. After the Blood River, when you pass through the cave with a tick, where you encounter two dogs and a large amount of crows along with an enemy Beast Cutter hunter. Climb the ladder on the left of the pit and instead of going forward, turn to the left and drop down the ledge. There will be a single piece of loot guarded by a Saif Hunter.

        Beast Cutter
        
        
        A trick weapon used by Old Hunters. 
        This thick iron cleaver slices through the toughest of beast hides, and when transformed the blade splits into sections, allowing one to lash it in the fashion of a heavy whip. 
        This crude weapon relies on brute force and is regrettably inelegant, suggesting that the hunts of the earliest hunters made for horrific affairs, painted in sanguine black and reds."
        
        
        
        When walking up the stairs to the nightmare version of the Grand Cathedral, turn left onto a small platform, then roll off and walk down some rough terrain to find the weapon on a corpse.
        
        
        
        Reminds many of the Zanpakut≈ç , a fictional segmented sword that can function as a whip. It is an iconic weapon from the Bleach anime.
        The untransformed form of the weapon is a cleaver-like serrated club, and it really looks like the samoan war club "Nifo Oti".

        Blade of mercy
        
        
        A special trick weapon passed down among hunters of hunters. One of the oldest weapons of the workshop. 
        Splits into two when activated. The weapon's warped blades are forged with siderite, a rare mineral of the heavens. Most effective swift attacks,such as after a quick-stepping."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers for 40000 echoes after obtaining the Crow Hunter Badge from Eileen the Crow's quest line.
        Killing Eileen is also a way to get the weapon early in the game.
        While progressing through Eileen's quest, it's possible for her to be killed by Henryk and thus drop the Crow Hunter Badge as a result, although the quest line will end.
        
        
        
        The Blade of Mercy was originally named as "Warped Twinblades" during the Alpha test, and it was the tool of choice for the "agile" hunter.
        Both the Burial Blade and Blade of Mercy make mentions of a mineral known as siderite in their descriptions.
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite, and it seems to be the reason why arcane power has direct scaling with both blade's damage output. Due to its extraterrestrial origins, that may explain why it cannot be buffed by an external source of any sort.
        It loosely resembles the Eleum Loyce from Dark Souls 2, a sword with two blades at the front.

        The demented hunter weapon brandished by Brador, the Healing Church assassin. 
        The Bloodletter assumes its true and terrifying form after it draws upon blood from the inner reaches of one's body and soul. 
        This is the only effective means of expelling tainted blood, or so Brador, isolated in his cell, continued to believe."
        
        
        
        Obtain the underground cell inner chamber key.
        Return to the underground prison (from the underground corpse pile lamp, go up the stairs and turn left) and open the door to Brador's cell. His cell is the second on the left behind a flight of downward stairs. Kill Brador to obtain the bloodletter.
        Brador will not be hostile in his cell, but will invade the player right outside his cell.

        Boom Hammer
        
        
        A trick weapon used by the old hunters, and crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. 
        A giant hammer equipped with a miniature furnace. When ignited and fired, it emits a volley of flame that explodes furiously upon impact. 
        Crush the beasts, then burn them - the brute simplicity of the Boom Hammer was favored by hunters with an acute distaste for beasts."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare. Inside a house that looks out of Central Yharnam, the same that is the shortcut to the cleric beast in the main game, where the 10 quicksilver bullets used to be. Be sure to shoot the explosives around the item (or act fast), as the wheelchair huntsman's corpse conceals a delayed molotov set to trigger when you try to grab the Boom Hammer, potential killing you in a huge blast.

        Burial Blade
        
        
        Trick weapon wielded by Gehrman, the first hunter." 
        A masterpiece that defined the entire array of weapons crafted at the workshop. Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens. 
        Gehrman surely saw the hunt as a dirge of farewell, wishing only that his prey might rest in peace, never again to awaken to another harrowing nightmare. "
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 60,000 Blood Echoes after defeating Gehrman, the First Hunter and acquiring the Old Hunter Badge from him.
        To make Gehrman fight you, the "Refuse" option must be selected.
        If one accepts his proposal, the game will outright end there and it will be impossible to obtain this weapon in that playthrough (not including the uncanny/lost forms found in the chalice dungeons).
        Normally, the Burial Blade can only be obtained in NG+ and beyond. However, one can bypass this by using Bold Hunter's Mark, or being killed, during The Moon Presence boss battle.
        
        
        
         The Burial Blade was the first trick weapon ever created, and it inspired others to develop new trick weapons, usually on the premise of adapting to different combat scenerios.
        Not all weapons adapt to different combat scenerios (e.g. Tonitrus), but the Burial Blade still inspired an entire series of weapons that could "transform" to satisfy different purposes.
        It was created, and exclusively wielded, by Gehrman.
        A Burial Blade can be found above the workshop table in the Hunter's Dream.
        The weapon's description mentions that "Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens."
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite. Due to its extraterrestrial nature, it could be the reason why it has direct scaling with arcane and cannot be tampered by external sources.
        Both the Burial Blade and the Blade of Mercy mentions the use of it in their descriptions.
        Interestingly enough, these two weapons also resemble the talons of Mergo's Wet Nurse.
        The shape of the scythe highly resembles Rurufon's scythe from Shadow Tower Abyss, an early title created by From Software as well as being recurring weapons in Souls series.
        A strange bug on rare occurrences the cape on the hunter may come off, usually in a boss fight you could notice if you dodge back and do an R1 combo the cape disappears. [Note, I haven't seen this happen in a while, it's possible that it may have been fixed, but I'll need confirmation on this]

        The Chikage isn't actually a katana - it is a katana/european sword hybrid. Its short crossguard resembles the one of an early viking sword, or the one of a xiphos (greek sword). The closest european crossguard shape with  this sword is the one of a Karabela (a polish sabre). In other hand, the  hilt and pommel resemble the ones of a longsword (a bit longer, to get easier katana traditional jutsu swings), while the blade shape and the 2-handed fighting style is very similar to a katana. A possible explanation for the origin of this hybrid is that the katana's design was imported to Cainhurst, where some modifications were made to create a sword similar to that commonly used by their knights.
        The Chikage is an allusion to a particular 'breed' of Katanas in the Souls games. While it is similar to both the Hiltless and Chaos Blade from Demon's Souls and Dark Souls respectively, the Chikage bears a stronger resemblance to the Magic Sword "Makoto" (also from Demon's Souls). The Makoto is the only one the bunch to actually DRAIN the user's HP over time, rather than decrease it with each successful swing.
        Chikage (ÂçÉÊôØ) literally means "Thousands Views", however if you separated the word into Chi Kage (Ë°ÄÂΩ±), it means "Blood Shadow". This could be correlated to the fact that Shadows Of Yharnam wield a similar katana with a slight  crossguard, however without using the bloodtinge.
        The transforming attack has the hunter sheathe the Chikage before unleashing a strike. This is a reference to Iaijutsu, a traditional Japanese sword technique that focuses on quick-drawing. At its finest, Iaijutse allows the warrior to unsheathe and strike at incredible speeds.
        The name seems to be a tribute to Chikage Yamamura (mentioned as a "special thanks" in credits)
        The name may also be a reference to the work "1000 Plateaus" by Giles Deluze and Felix Guattari, a famous philosophical essay about fluidity and functionality, maybe dirrectly tied to the esoteric nature of the weapons function.  
        
        
    

        Kos Parasite
        
        
        When the carcass of Kos washed up on the coast, its insides were teeming with tiny parasites, unlike any found in humans.

        Dropped by Orphan of Kos
        
        
        
        The Kos Parasite is perhaps the most interestingly unique weapon in Bloodborne in various ways: It is one of two weapons that can reach it's full potential while using a rune (the other being Beast Claw), the weapon itself is not held, it is purely an arcane weapon, it is the only weapon directly dropped by defeating a boss, it has the highest durability of any weapon at 600 respectively, it is the only weapon to have an A-scaling of any weapon without any upgrades and is the only weapon to have an S-scaling by upgrading it twice.

        Church Pick
        
        
        One of the old trick weapons of the Healing Church, a hunting weapon formed from one of the giant picks that appear in old beast tales. 
        The Church Pick initially serves as a large sword, but when transformed functions as an extended war pick. In spite of its origins, it is a highly practical weapon."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Dropped by a hunter wearing Yahar'Gul set (presumably, this is the summonable Old Hunter Defector Antal) in one of the cells that you open with the Underground Cell Key from the Research Hall. To make this battle simple, attack him through the door with a strong R2 attack, then leave the room. He will lose sight of you and his AI will return to a standstill behind the door. Rinse and repeat until dead.
        
        
        
        The Church Pick And The Hunter's Axe both have similar appearance. When transformed, both are wielded as a polearm and have the same de-transformation attack. The only difference apart from the Church Pick having a slightly more complicated mechanism is that the Hunter's Axe is a strength-based weapon.
        A few of its attacks in the transformed mode are very similar to that of the Burial Blade.

        Holy Moonlight Sword
        
        
        An arcane sword discovered long ago by Ludwig. 
        When blue moonlight dances around the sword, and it channels the abyssal cosmos, its great blade will hurl a shadowy lightwave. 
        The Holy Moonlight Sword is synonymous with Ludwig, the Holy Blade, but few have ever set eyes on the great blade, and whatever guidance it has to offer, it seems to be of a very private, elusive sort."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Found on the Underground Corpse Pile after the fight against Ludwig, The Holy Blade. Ludwig's head will be lying there and you can:
        Kill the head for the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and talk to the head. When prompted, reply "Yes" and you'll get the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and reply "No", then come back later and Simon the Harrowed will be there and give you the sword.
        NOTE: This weapon is missable. If Lawrence is killed before you obtain it, you will no longer be able to talk to the head or obtain it from Simon.
        
        
        
        It seems to be another reappearance of the Moonlight Greatsword, a recurring item found around FromSoftware's games. Notable examples of such games include the first, second and third Dark Souls games, Demon's Souls, King's Field, Ninja Blade, Enchanted Arms, Armored Core, 3D Dot Game Heroes, and Otogi.

        Hunter Axe
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used on the hunt. Retains the qualities of an axe, but offers a wider palette of attacks by transforming. Boasts a heavy blunt attack, leading to high rally potential. No matter their pasts, beasts are no more than beasts. Some choose this axe to play the part of executioner."
        
        
        
        It's possible to pick this trick weapon as a starting weapon near the beginning of Bloodborne.
        If not chosen, it can instead be purchased from the Messengers after the Hunter has found the Saw Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is wielded by Father Gascoigne.
        However, he has a moveset that is different from the Hunter's version.
        He is also capable of using his unique Hunter Pistol even while his Hunter Axe is transformed, which is impossible for the Hunter to do.
        It's also wielded by the Madara's Twin who drops Madara's Whistle when defeated.
        Another hostile hunter NPC wields this trick weapon in the Nightmare Frontier.
        It's been heavily debated by the fanbase whether the transformed mode is a halberd or poleaxe.
        Both forms utilized axe heads with a spear tip at the end (although some poleaxes used hammer heads instead).
        However, neither weapon was known to have extendable handles, which is a special trademark of the Hunter Axe.
        In either case, it's possible this trick weapon was inspired by both weapons and simply incorporated many different designs.
        While wielded in it's transformed mode if the player had a torch equipped in the off-hand beasts afraid of the fire will still recoil in fear of you as if you were brandishing the torch normally (Tested on Beast Patient)

        Kirkhammer
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. On the one side, an easily handled silver sword. On the other, a giant obtuse stone weapon, characterized by a blunt strike and extreme force of impact. The Church takes a heavy-handed, merciless stance toward the plague of beasts, an irony not lost upon the wielders of this most symbolic weapon."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers after acquiring the Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        A miniature of the Kirkhammer was included as the Pre-Order Bonus for Asian editions of Bloodborne. [See the Bundles page for details]
        A "kirk" is an archaic old english word meaning "church."
        This means the weapon is literately known as the Church Hammer.
        The wording also might be a nod to Nordic culture since the word "Kirk" originated from northern England and Old Norse wording.
        The etched wording on the side of the hammer part has similarities to the Old Norse alphabet.
        However, it also has similarities to the Elder Futhark, one of the oldest forms of the runic alphabet system used by Germanic tribes.
        Similar etchings can be found on gravestones all over Yharnam.
        The sword used for this weapon is very similar to the one used for Ludwig's Holy Blade.
        This suggests that the Healing Church used the method of "interchangeable parts" to efficiently mass produce weapons for their hunters.
        However, the sword used for the Kirkhammer is shorter.
        It's wielded by Alfred, should you choose to be friends with him.
        He uses this weapon as a summon.
        However, he wields the Logarius' Wheel if you find him in Cainhurst Castle under special circumstances.
        When untransformed, with the hammer part on the character's back, some cloth parts (capes etc.) of the armor can either get awkwardly stuck on it or cover it.
        Despite being labeled a 'stone weapon', the etchings, wear, and sound produced when it strikes indicate that the hammer is in fact made of metal.

        Logarius's Wheel
        
        
        "Weapon wielded by martyr Logarius' band of executioners. 
        Used to slaughter the Vilebloods in Cainhurst. Bathed in pools of their blood, and forever steeped in their ire. 
        Transform to release the power of the wheel and manifest their lingering rage in a show of utter brilliance."
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 13,000 Blood Echoes after acquiring the Wheel Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        Alfred utilizes the Logarius' Wheel when found in Cainhurst Castle.
        This weapon is yet another reference to Berserk, as they are often made in Miyazaki's previous Souls games.
        "Logarius and his band of executioners" bear many similarities to Mozgus, an insanely devout man who traveled the land torturing heretics along with his disciples.
        The wheel in particular was wielded by one of his six disciples, .
        In Dark Souls, Bonewheel Skeletons are another reference to Mozgus' disciples.
        In real life, although wheels weren't typically wielded as weapons, they were commonly used as torture devices, especially during the Middle Ages.
        Torture wheels were nicknamed "breaking wheels," since victims often times would have their limbs broken during the process.
        They were also known as "catherine wheels."
         It's quite possible that Logarius' Wheel also takes some inspiration in its use as a weapon from the English folklore legend of Tom Hickathrift. Tom was a fabled giant killer who made use of a cartwheel to vanquish the Wisbech Giant (also referred to as an ogre).
        Lore theories can be found under "From Berserk to Bloodborne".

        Ludwig's Holy Blade
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. It is said that the silver sword was employed by Ludwig, the first hunter of the church. When transformed, it combines with its sheath to form a greatsword. 
        It exhibits several departures from the workshop's design, suggesting that the Church anticipated much larger inhuman beasts."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased for 20,000 echoes from the Messengers after obtaining the Radiant Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon was wielded by Ludwig, a famous hunter of the Healing Church who designed the blade based on the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        According to the description, Ludwig wielded this sword in combat instead of the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        However, in his boss fight, he wields the Holy Moonlight Sword during a certain part in the fight.
        It is possible that Ludwig wielded the Holy Moonlight Sword and his fellow hunters, inspired by the huge weapon, sought to make replicas. Unable to make a magic sword, a huge metal sheath was the compromise.
        Before the DLC's release, Ludwig's Holy Blade was thought of as From Software's traditional "Moonlight Greatsword" seen throughout various games by the fanbase.
        However, this sword was eventually revealed in the DLC to be a replica of the "true" Moonlight Greatsword in Bloodborne, the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        This isn't the first time Miyazaki used the name of classical music composers in a game.
        A boss from the first "Dark Souls" game, Dragonslayer Ornstein, is named after Leo Ornstein.
        Berlioz from "Armored Core 4" is named after Hector Berlioz.
        The normal form of this weapon is very similar to the sword used for the Kirkhammer.
        However, this sword's normal form has a slightly longer reach when compared to the Kirkhammer's blade.
        The similar nature of these swords suggests that the Healing Church used the method of interchangeable parts to quickly mass produce weapons for their hunters.

        Rakuyo
        
        
        Hunter weapon wielded by Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower. 
        A trick sword originated in the same country as the Cainhurst Chikage, only this sword feeds not off blood, but instead demands great dexterity. 
        Lady Maria was fond of this aspect of the Rakuyo, as she frowned upon blood blades, despite being a distant relative of the queen. 
        One day, she abandoned her beloved Rakuyo, casting it into a dark well, when she could stomach it no longer."
        
        
        
        Fishing Hamlet. Get to the bottom of the well. Can be reached from the underground tunnels at the end of the area or via a ladder in the well right away. In that area a Shark Giant will wander around. Fighting him makes a second one appear after the first reaches sufficiently low health. The first giant will walk over near the ladder and scream at the ceiling, causing the second one to drop. The second one drops the weapon.
        Fighting the two of them can be difficult and it is a good idea to use the Shaman Bone Blade to make them fight each other and finish off the weaker one. Molotov cocktails are also very effective against them. If neither is available to you, try to kill the one with the anchor first, as it is significantly harder to dodge.
        One easy way to beat them is use of ranged weapon like Simon's Bowblade if you are a bloodtinge build, and the Holy Moonlight Sword if you are an arcane build.
        A Threaded Cane's transformed whip can easily hit the giants from the ledge once they're lured over and begin attacking, but be sure to keep your distance after each hit. Except that there is no way to lure them over the the ledge. No ranged weapon will hit the one standing at the back and the one hanging from the ceiling doesn't drop down until the first one is at 50% health. 
        Unlike other giants in the game, these ones are easy to gun parry for a visceral attack. Keep in mind this will get very tricky after the other one starts fighting, so try to separate them and time your viscerals to get the invincibility at the right moment.
        If your range is inadequate you can use the monocular to angle a throwing knife to be able to hit the shark giant in the back. This way, you can continue from the strategy of killing them on the ledge with a gun/magic without going around. (confirmed as of January 19th, 2019)
        Chaining together backstabs is a very effecient way of dealing with them, if played right you should be able to eliminate the first shark giant before the second reaches you this way. It is extremely difficult to get behind the patrolling Shark Giant without him detecting you. 
        For a video showing an easy way to kill the sharks with a monocular and a throwing knife strategy, check .
        
        
        
        Rakuyo (ËêΩËëâ) literally means "falling leaf".
        The sword of Rakuyo bears resemblance to the "ky≈´ gunt≈ç", which was a hybrid of the sabre/katana with a handguard, used during the Russo-Japanese War.

        The Kos Parasite is perhaps the most interestingly unique weapon in Bloodborne in various ways: It is one of two weapons that can reach it's full potential while using a rune (the other being Beast Claw), the weapon itself is not held, it is purely an arcane weapon, it is the only weapon directly dropped by defeating a boss, it has the highest durability of any weapon at 600 respectively, it is the only weapon to have an A-scaling of any weapon without any upgrades and is the only weapon to have an S-scaling by upgrading it twice.

        Reiterpallasch
        
        
        Weapon wielded by the Knights of Cainhurst. 
        Combines an elegant knight's sword with the peculiar firearm wielded by the Cainhurst order. 
        The old nobles, long-time imbibers of blood, are no strangers to the sanguine plague, and the disposal of beasts was a discrete task left to their servants, or knights, as they were called for the sake of appearances."
        
        
        
        It's found in a chest located in the entrance hall of Cainhurst Castle, where the Bound Widows are first encountered. When you first enter the room from the main entrance, run towards your two o'clock. The chest will be found in a corner.
        
        
        
        The Reiterpallasch (from German Reiter "horseback rider" and hungarian pallos [Ààp…ílo É] "sword") is a 17th century Hungarian straight sword with a typically double edged blade and guarded hilt that was used by Hungarian noble cavalry and later adapted by most western European armies.
        As pointed out in its description, the rifle spear is made "possibly in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon" (i.e. this one).
        Wynne D. Fanchon from Armored Core: For Answer; another From Software title, pilots a NEXT named Reiterpallasch.
        Relevant lore theories exist under The Mysteries of Cainhurst Garb and Architecture.

        Rifle Spear
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. A prototype weapon serving as a simple firearm and spear, possibly created in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon. Lacks any notable functions, saving that it is the only trick weapon with an attached gun. "
        
        
        
        It can be found inside a hidden building in Old Yharnam. From the area you fight the first NPC Hunter (who wields a saw spear), drop down where the railing is missing in a corner and land on the ledges below. Go into the building and follow the stairs up; eventually you can find it stashed on a corpse tucked away in a hidden nook as you advance.
        Bought from the messengers for 4000 blood echoes after acquiring the Powder Keg Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        According to the Rifle Spear's description, it was designed as an imitation of "a lost Cainhurst weapon".
        That particular weapon may or may not be the Reiterpallasch.
        It should be noted these two weapons are the only two skill/firearm hybrids whose alternate forms utilize guns.
        The third skill/firearm hybrid weapon in this game is Simon's Bowblade, which transforms from a sword into a bow.
        The Rifle Spear is carried by a Yahar'Gul Hunter in the Cathedral Ward.
        This fight can be tricky because you first encounter a Yahar'Gul Hunter that uses a Tonitrus near the base of the stairs, and if you advance too far towards the houses, the Rifle Spear Yahar'Gul Hunter will join the fight as well.
        He also uses Ludwig's Rifle, meaning he can hit you from a considerable distance with shotgun pellets no matter what mode he uses for the Rifle Spear.

        Saw Cleaver
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used in the hunting business. 
        This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts, transforms into a long cleaver that makes use of centrifugal force. 
        The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness the more grotesquely transformed the beast."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired as a gift from the Messengers the first time you visit the Hunter's Dream.
        If you don't select it, you may buy it after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne.)
        
        
        
        The Saw Cleaver is the Trick Weapon featured on the title screen.
        It was also one of the first weapons to be revealed for this game.
        Overall the mechanisms of this weapon didn't change at all, starting all the way back when Bloodborne was still known as "Project Beast."
        According to the concept art, the Saw Cleaver uses a trigger mechanism to unlock the joint during transformation.
        The design of the Saw Cleaver seems to be inspired by multiple references:
        The transformed cleaver shows a resemblance to LB-66 MOONLIGHT from Armored Core V.
        The Japanese name is written as "nokogiri nata" („Éé„Ç≥„ÇÆ„É™Èâà) or "saw hatchet". Nokogiri is a traditional Japanese saw that cuts from the pull stroke, as opposed to the more common push stroke.
        In real life, there is a type of cleaver known as a mezzaluna ("half moon") cleaver, known for chopping/mincing up various food products.
        Most of these types of cleavers have handles on both ends.
        However, some use a single handle that stretches across the blade, which was used to chop up herbs usually; the saw cleaver follows this particular model.
        Coincidentally, the Strength/Skill/Arcane scaling at maximum level is "CDC" in their respective order.
        The CDC is an American organization designed to combat and prevent "health threats" of varying natures.
        Since the beast scourge acts like a plague (and is spread due to blood-related reasons), those who wield the Saw Cleaver can be thought of as fighting a dangerous epidemic.
        Henryk uses this weapon when he fights you and Eileen the Crow during her questline, as well as when he is summoned by you when using the Old Hunter Bell.

        Simon's Bowblade
        
        
        Choice weapon of Simon, one of the first Healing Church hunters.
        Simon despised firearms, and so the Church workshop had this specially fashioned to his liking. The large curved blade serves as a bow when transformed.
        But aside from a few close friends, Simon was scoffed at for his choice of arms, for who would dare face the beasts with a measly bow?"

        Stake Driver
        
        
        A trick weapon fashioned by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. Favored by the retired hunter Djura. 
        The stake driver, with its queerly complex design, violently drives thick stakes into the flesh of foes. 
        The stake driver allows for high-damage critical attacks, but is difficult to use and leaves its wielder wide open, but none of this should bother a mere Powder Keg."
        
        
        
        Obtain Powder Keg Hunter Badge to unlock for purchase at the Messengers for 8,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Stake Driver is exclusively wielded by Djura when he is still hostile towards you.
        His fight is tricky because the area around him is very limited, meaning you can fall to your death if you're not careful.
        Furthermore, the limited space is perfect for his choice of weapon which has a short range.
        This is modeled after the "Pile Bunker," a type of fictional weaponry which launches piston with gunpowder or explosion.
        In the Japanese version of Bloodborne, this weapon is literally called the Pile Hammer („Éë„Ç§„É´„Éè„É≥„Éû„Éº).
        It bears a striking resemblance to the "Parrying Blade" weapons seen in several "Armored Core" games.
        Has the highest charged attack multiplier out of any other weapon.

        Threaded Cane
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used by hunters on their duties. Sufficiently deadly as a rigid bladed cane, but also serves as a whip when its blade is split into many. Concealing the weapon inside the cane and flogging the beasts with the whip is partly an act of ceremony, an attempt to demonstrate to oneself that the bloodlust of the hunt will never encroach upon the soul."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired at the beginning of the game as a gift from the Messengers.
        If not selected, it is later available for purchase from the blood fountain messengers after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne).
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is used by Iosefka, Last Scholar Yurie and the Frontier Church Hunter.
        Gehrman carries a generic cane in the Workshop instead of the Threaded Cane.
        This trick weapon is possibly inspired by the sword used by Jean-Fran√ßois de Morangias in the climactic battle of French action-horror film Brotherhood of the Wolf (which bears many other similarities to Bloodborne), or the sword used by a bandit leader in the anime/manga series Claymore. Both these weapons act as a straight, double-edged sword that can transform into a segmented, bladed whip.

        Tonitrus
        
        
        "A unique trick weapon contrived by Archibald, the infamous eccentric of the Healing Church workshop. 
        Striking this peculiar iron morning star flail like a match generates the same blue sparks that blanket a darkbeast. 
        Unfortunately, for reasons untold, the hunters of Archibald's time did not fully take to the device."
        
        
        
        Acquire the Spark Hunter Badge by defeating Darkbeast Paarl  to purchase from Messengers.
        Treasure: Yahar'gul, Unseen Village, at the top end of the road. (guarded by 2 Tainted Dogs and a Snatcher during daytime)
        
        
        
        Tonitrus is a Latin word meaning "thunder."
        The in-game description classifies this trick weapon as a morning star flail, but it's actually modeled in the form of a mace.
        The description of Archibald bears many similarities to Nikola Tesla, a famed inventor in real life who specialized in the field of electricity.
        Nikola Tesla created the Tesla Coil, a device that also bears many similarities to the Tonitrus.
        The Tonitrus also bears similarities with the aspergillum, a device used by the Roman Catholic Church to sprinkle holy water.
        According to the description of the Spark Hunter Badge, Archibald was associated with the Healing Church.
        In this sense, it may have been designed under the themes of "purificiation" and "cleansing" that is associated with many Healing Church trick weapons/tools.
        However, due to Archibald's fascination with Dark Beasts, it's more likely he designed the Tonitrus as a measure to replicate the sparks these creatures could unleash.

        Whirligig Saw
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs, and weapon of choice of the Old Hunter Valtr, the Beast Eater. 
        This weapon pummels beasts in its mace form, but its true strength lies in its attached mechanical saws. 
        These discs, lined with serrated teeth,spin rapidly, thrashing the flesh of beasts into fine shreds."
        
        
        
        From the Nightmare Church go down the stairs and follow the path. Drop down into the pools of blood of follow the path further until you reach the Cannon Executioner. Follow the left wall and turn down the path, the weapon is at the end.
        
        
        
        If you use the L2 buzzsaw attack against Orphan of Kos and hold it in place, it attempts to make an immediate counterattack for each time it gets hit by the whirring blades, only to get interrupted by the next hit. It shrieks every time it attacks, so as a result, it lets loose dozens of overlapping shriek sound effects for as long as you hold it in place.
        A whirligig is defined as a toy that is constantly spinning, such as a top or pinwheel, or as something regarded as hectic and constantly changing.
        Similar to most Powder Keg weapons sharing homage to Armored Core weapons, the Whirligig Saw is based on the Grind Blade.
        
    

        Logarius's Wheel
        
        
        "Weapon wielded by martyr Logarius' band of executioners. 
        Used to slaughter the Vilebloods in Cainhurst. Bathed in pools of their blood, and forever steeped in their ire. 
        Transform to release the power of the wheel and manifest their lingering rage in a show of utter brilliance."
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 13,000 Blood Echoes after acquiring the Wheel Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        Alfred utilizes the Logarius' Wheel when found in Cainhurst Castle.
        This weapon is yet another reference to Berserk, as they are often made in Miyazaki's previous Souls games.
        "Logarius and his band of executioners" bear many similarities to Mozgus, an insanely devout man who traveled the land torturing heretics along with his disciples.
        The wheel in particular was wielded by one of his six disciples, .
        In Dark Souls, Bonewheel Skeletons are another reference to Mozgus' disciples.
        In real life, although wheels weren't typically wielded as weapons, they were commonly used as torture devices, especially during the Middle Ages.
        Torture wheels were nicknamed "breaking wheels," since victims often times would have their limbs broken during the process.
        They were also known as "catherine wheels."
         It's quite possible that Logarius' Wheel also takes some inspiration in its use as a weapon from the English folklore legend of Tom Hickathrift. Tom was a fabled giant killer who made use of a cartwheel to vanquish the Wisbech Giant (also referred to as an ogre).
        Lore theories can be found under "From Berserk to Bloodborne".

        Amygdalan Arm 
        
        
        The arm of a small Amygdala Great One. 
        Strictly speaking, the Amygdalan Arm is no trick weapon of any sort, but certain madmen wield them like clubs. 
        Starts as a large, tough blunt weapon formed of bone, but when extended, the hand quivers as if it were still alive.
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare, cave at the end of the blood river to the right after getting out of the building that used to be the shortcut to the Cleric Beast in the main game. Gatling Gun Hunter dropping the Gatling Gun and a Blood-Starved Beast can be also found here. Arm is near the Blood-Starved Beast at the end of the cave.
        
        
        
        The Amygdalan Arm is a Trick Weapon in name only, considering that it is an arm obtained from Amygdala.
        The arm is remarkably small, as even the Lesser Amygdalae are huge. Perhaps it came from a newborn Amygdala.
        The arm could be the inspiration behind the Burial Blade.

        "Logarius and his band of executioners" bear many similarities to Mozgus, an insanely devout man who traveled the land torturing heretics along with his disciples.

        In real life, although wheels weren't typically wielded as weapons, they were commonly used as torture devices, especially during the Middle Ages.
        Torture wheels were nicknamed "breaking wheels," since victims often times would have their limbs broken during the process.
        They were also known as "catherine wheels."
         It's quite possible that Logarius' Wheel also takes some inspiration in its use as a weapon from the English folklore legend of Tom Hickathrift. Tom was a fabled giant killer who made use of a cartwheel to vanquish the Wisbech Giant (also referred to as an ogre).

        Beast Claw
        
        
        Beastly weapon wielded by Irreverent Izzy.
        Crafted by chiseling the long bones of an undead darkbeast and fastening them to the weapon. The bones are still alive, and when unleashed, grant its wielder a spurt of beastly power. 
        As flesh is flayed and blood is sprayed, the beast within awakens, and in time, the wielder of this weapon surges with both strength and feverish reverie."
        
        
        
        Ailing Loran Chalice: Layer 2 treasure room. Room is on the right when exiting the elevator from first layer boss fight, before the second layers lantern.
        Can be bought from messengers for 34000 echoes after acquisition.
        Can be bought from messengers after co-operation with player who has them. This only occurs in Hunter's dream before fight with Gehrman or Moon Presence. It is not needed to complete any Chalice Dungeons. It is unknown if this is glitch or intentional. Was patched by 1.07 or 1.08.
        
        
        
        When this weapon is equipped, your gloves will be replaced by two bone gauntlets. This can allow for the lost art of rapid glove changing if you switch your weapons really fast.
        You can charge the beasthood meter on the first windows (Gilbert) of Central Yharnam
        In the past, there was a rare glitch that allowed a player to obtain this weapon without finding it in the Chalice Dungeons.
        It has since been patched, although it isn't quite known when it was successfully patched.

        Beasthunter Saif
        
        
        A trick weapon used by the old hunters. 
        A second blade is found inside the curve of the main one. In its initial form, the saif can be wielded like a long curved sword, but when transformed, its blade is contracted, allowing for quick, repeated stabs. 
        Although this trick weapon allows for adaptive combat, it was later replaced by saws and similar weapons that were more effective at disposing of beasts."

There will be a single piece of loot guarded by a Saif Hunter.

        Beast Cutter
        
        
        A trick weapon used by Old Hunters. 
        This thick iron cleaver slices through the toughest of beast hides, and when transformed the blade splits into sections, allowing one to lash it in the fashion of a heavy whip. 
        This crude weapon relies on brute force and is regrettably inelegant, suggesting that the hunts of the earliest hunters made for horrific affairs, painted in sanguine black and reds."
        
        
        
        When walking up the stairs to the nightmare version of the Grand Cathedral, turn left onto a small platform, then roll off and walk down some rough terrain to find the weapon on a corpse.
        
        
        
        Reminds many of the Zanpakut≈ç , a fictional segmented sword that can function as a whip. It is an iconic weapon from the Bleach anime.
        The untransformed form of the weapon is a cleaver-like serrated club, and it really looks like the samoan war club "Nifo Oti".

        Blade of mercy
        
        
        A special trick weapon passed down among hunters of hunters. One of the oldest weapons of the workshop. 
        Splits into two when activated. The weapon's warped blades are forged with siderite, a rare mineral of the heavens. Most effective swift attacks,such as after a quick-stepping."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers for 40000 echoes after obtaining the Crow Hunter Badge from Eileen the Crow's quest line.
        Killing Eileen is also a way to get the weapon early in the game.
        While progressing through Eileen's quest, it's possible for her to be killed by Henryk and thus drop the Crow Hunter Badge as a result, although the quest line will end.
        
        
        
        The Blade of Mercy was originally named as "Warped Twinblades" during the Alpha test, and it was the tool of choice for the "agile" hunter.
        Both the Burial Blade and Blade of Mercy make mentions of a mineral known as siderite in their descriptions.
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite, and it seems to be the reason why arcane power has direct scaling with both blade's damage output. Due to its extraterrestrial origins, that may explain why it cannot be buffed by an external source of any sort.
        It loosely resembles the Eleum Loyce from Dark Souls 2, a sword with two blades at the front.

        The demented hunter weapon brandished by Brador, the Healing Church assassin. 
        The Bloodletter assumes its true and terrifying form after it draws upon blood from the inner reaches of one's body and soul. 
        This is the only effective means of expelling tainted blood, or so Brador, isolated in his cell, continued to believe."
        
        
        
        Obtain the underground cell inner chamber key.
        Return to the underground prison (from the underground corpse pile lamp, go up the stairs and turn left) and open the door to Brador's cell. His cell is the second on the left behind a flight of downward stairs. Kill Brador to obtain the bloodletter.
        Brador will not be hostile in his cell, but will invade the player right outside his cell.

        Boom Hammer
        
        
        A trick weapon used by the old hunters, and crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. 
        A giant hammer equipped with a miniature furnace. When ignited and fired, it emits a volley of flame that explodes furiously upon impact. 
        Crush the beasts, then burn them - the brute simplicity of the Boom Hammer was favored by hunters with an acute distaste for beasts."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare. Inside a house that looks out of Central Yharnam, the same that is the shortcut to the cleric beast in the main game, where the 10 quicksilver bullets used to be. Be sure to shoot the explosives around the item (or act fast), as the wheelchair huntsman's corpse conceals a delayed molotov set to trigger when you try to grab the Boom Hammer, potential killing you in a huge blast.
        
        
        
        When the Boomhammer is lit, Beast Patient mobs will back away from the player as if they had a torch equipped. (May need to initiate primed attack first)

        Burial Blade
        
        
        Trick weapon wielded by Gehrman, the first hunter." 
        A masterpiece that defined the entire array of weapons crafted at the workshop. Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens. 
        Gehrman surely saw the hunt as a dirge of farewell, wishing only that his prey might rest in peace, never again to awaken to another harrowing nightmare. "
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 60,000 Blood Echoes after defeating Gehrman, the First Hunter and acquiring the Old Hunter Badge from him.
        To make Gehrman fight you, the "Refuse" option must be selected.
        If one accepts his proposal, the game will outright end there and it will be impossible to obtain this weapon in that playthrough (not including the uncanny/lost forms found in the chalice dungeons).
        Normally, the Burial Blade can only be obtained in NG+ and beyond. However, one can bypass this by using Bold Hunter's Mark, or being killed, during The Moon Presence boss battle.
        
        
        
         The Burial Blade was the first trick weapon ever created, and it inspired others to develop new trick weapons, usually on the premise of adapting to different combat scenerios.
        Not all weapons adapt to different combat scenerios (e.g. Tonitrus), but the Burial Blade still inspired an entire series of weapons that could "transform" to satisfy different purposes.
        It was created, and exclusively wielded, by Gehrman.
        A Burial Blade can be found above the workshop table in the Hunter's Dream.
        The weapon's description mentions that "Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens."
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite. Due to its extraterrestrial nature, it could be the reason why it has direct scaling with arcane and cannot be tampered by external sources.
        Both the Burial Blade and the Blade of Mercy mentions the use of it in their descriptions.
        Interestingly enough, these two weapons also resemble the talons of Mergo's Wet Nurse.
        The shape of the scythe highly resembles Rurufon's scythe from Shadow Tower Abyss, an early title created by From Software as well as being recurring weapons in Souls series.
        A strange bug on rare occurrences the cape on the hunter may come off, usually in a boss fight you could notice if you dodge back and do an R1 combo the cape disappears. [Note, I haven't seen this happen in a while, it's possible that it may have been fixed, but I'll need confirmation on this]

        Chikage
        
        
        Foreign-made weapon wielded by the royal guards who protect Annalise, Queen of the Vilebloods at Cainhurst Castle. 
        When the intricate, rippled engraving that spans the Chikage's blade is imbrued with blood, the sword sings in scarlet hues. 
        However, the rite eats away at the wielder's very essence."
        
        
        
        Join the Cainhurst Vilebloods covenant available at Cainhurst Castle, and then purchase from the Messengers for 50,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Chikage isn't actually a katana - it is a katana/european sword hybrid. Its short crossguard resembles the one of an early viking sword, or the one of a xiphos (greek sword). The closest european crossguard shape with  this sword is the one of a Karabela (a polish sabre). In other hand, the  hilt and pommel resemble the ones of a longsword (a bit longer, to get easier katana traditional jutsu swings), while the blade shape and the 2-handed fighting style is very similar to a katana. A possible explanation for the origin of this hybrid is that the katana's design was imported to Cainhurst, where some modifications were made to create a sword similar to that commonly used by their knights.
        The Chikage is an allusion to a particular 'breed' of Katanas in the Souls games. While it is similar to both the Hiltless and Chaos Blade from Demon's Souls and Dark Souls respectively, the Chikage bears a stronger resemblance to the Magic Sword "Makoto" (also from Demon's Souls). The Makoto is the only one the bunch to actually DRAIN the user's HP over time, rather than decrease it with each successful swing.
        Chikage (ÂçÉÊôØ) literally means "Thousands Views", however if you separated the word into Chi Kage (Ë°ÄÂΩ±), it means "Blood Shadow". This could be correlated to the fact that Shadows Of Yharnam wield a similar katana with a slight  crossguard, however without using the bloodtinge.
        The transforming attack has the hunter sheathe the Chikage before unleashing a strike. This is a reference to Iaijutsu, a traditional Japanese sword technique that focuses on quick-drawing. At its finest, Iaijutse allows the warrior to unsheathe and strike at incredible speeds.
        The name seems to be a tribute to Chikage Yamamura (mentioned as a "special thanks" in credits)
        The name may also be a reference to the work "1000 Plateaus" by Giles Deluze and Felix Guattari, a famous philosophical essay about fluidity and functionality, maybe dirrectly tied to the esoteric nature of the weapons function.  
        
        
    

        Logarius's Wheel
        
        
        "Weapon wielded by martyr Logarius' band of executioners.

        Alfred utilizes the Logarius' Wheel when found in Cainhurst Castle.
        This weapon is yet another reference to Berserk, as they are often made in Miyazaki's previous Souls games.
        "Logarius and his band of executioners" bear many similarities to Mozgus, an insanely devout man who traveled the land torturing heretics along with his disciples.

        In real life, although wheels weren't typically wielded as weapons, they were commonly used as torture devices, especially during the Middle Ages.

        Church Pick
        
        
        One of the old trick weapons of the Healing Church, a hunting weapon formed from one of the giant picks that appear in old beast tales. 
        The Church Pick initially serves as a large sword, but when transformed functions as an extended war pick. In spite of its origins, it is a highly practical weapon."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Dropped by a hunter wearing Yahar'Gul set (presumably, this is the summonable Old Hunter Defector Antal) in one of the cells that you open with the Underground Cell Key from the Research Hall. To make this battle simple, attack him through the door with a strong R2 attack, then leave the room. He will lose sight of you and his AI will return to a standstill behind the door. Rinse and repeat until dead.
        
        
        
        The Church Pick And The Hunter's Axe both have similar appearance. When transformed, both are wielded as a polearm and have the same de-transformation attack. The only difference apart from the Church Pick having a slightly more complicated mechanism is that the Hunter's Axe is a strength-based weapon.
        A few of its attacks in the transformed mode are very similar to that of the Burial Blade.
        The Church Pick os the weapon of choice of the summonable Old Hunter NPC Defector Antal

        Holy Moonlight Sword
        
        
        An arcane sword discovered long ago by Ludwig. 
        When blue moonlight dances around the sword, and it channels the abyssal cosmos, its great blade will hurl a shadowy lightwave. 
        The Holy Moonlight Sword is synonymous with Ludwig, the Holy Blade, but few have ever set eyes on the great blade, and whatever guidance it has to offer, it seems to be of a very private, elusive sort."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Found on the Underground Corpse Pile after the fight against Ludwig, The Holy Blade. Ludwig's head will be lying there and you can:
        Kill the head for the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and talk to the head. When prompted, reply "Yes" and you'll get the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and reply "No", then come back later and Simon the Harrowed will be there and give you the sword.
        NOTE: This weapon is missable. If Lawrence is killed before you obtain it, you will no longer be able to talk to the head or obtain it from Simon.
        
        
        
        It seems to be another reappearance of the Moonlight Greatsword, a recurring item found around FromSoftware's games. Notable examples of such games include the first, second and third Dark Souls games, Demon's Souls, King's Field, Ninja Blade, Enchanted Arms, Armored Core, 3D Dot Game Heroes, and Otogi.

        Hunter Axe
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used on the hunt. Retains the qualities of an axe, but offers a wider palette of attacks by transforming. Boasts a heavy blunt attack, leading to high rally potential. No matter their pasts, beasts are no more than beasts. Some choose this axe to play the part of executioner."
        
        
        
        It's possible to pick this trick weapon as a starting weapon near the beginning of Bloodborne.
        If not chosen, it can instead be purchased from the Messengers after the Hunter has found the Saw Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is wielded by Father Gascoigne.
        However, he has a moveset that is different from the Hunter's version.
        He is also capable of using his unique Hunter Pistol even while his Hunter Axe is transformed, which is impossible for the Hunter to do.
        It's also wielded by the Madara's Twin who drops Madara's Whistle when defeated.
        Another hostile hunter NPC wields this trick weapon in the Nightmare Frontier.
        It's been heavily debated by the fanbase whether the transformed mode is a halberd or poleaxe.
        Both forms utilized axe heads with a spear tip at the end (although some poleaxes used hammer heads instead).
        However, neither weapon was known to have extendable handles, which is a special trademark of the Hunter Axe.
        In either case, it's possible this trick weapon was inspired by both weapons and simply incorporated many different designs.
        While wielded in it's transformed mode if the player had a torch equipped in the off-hand beasts afraid of the fire will still recoil in fear of you as if you were brandishing the torch normally (Tested on Beast Patient)

        Kirkhammer
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. On the one side, an easily handled silver sword. On the other, a giant obtuse stone weapon, characterized by a blunt strike and extreme force of impact. The Church takes a heavy-handed, merciless stance toward the plague of beasts, an irony not lost upon the wielders of this most symbolic weapon."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers after acquiring the Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        A miniature of the Kirkhammer was included as the Pre-Order Bonus for Asian editions of Bloodborne. [See the Bundles page for details]
        A "kirk" is an archaic old english word meaning "church."
        This means the weapon is literately known as the Church Hammer.
        The wording also might be a nod to Nordic culture since the word "Kirk" originated from northern England and Old Norse wording.
        The etched wording on the side of the hammer part has similarities to the Old Norse alphabet.
        However, it also has similarities to the Elder Futhark, one of the oldest forms of the runic alphabet system used by Germanic tribes.
        Similar etchings can be found on gravestones all over Yharnam.
        The sword used for this weapon is very similar to the one used for Ludwig's Holy Blade.
        This suggests that the Healing Church used the method of "interchangeable parts" to efficiently mass produce weapons for their hunters.
        However, the sword used for the Kirkhammer is shorter.
        It's wielded by Alfred, should you choose to be friends with him.
        He uses this weapon as a summon.
        However, he wields the Logarius' Wheel if you find him in Cainhurst Castle under special circumstances.
        When untransformed, with the hammer part on the character's back, some cloth parts (capes etc.) of the armor can either get awkwardly stuck on it or cover it.
        Despite being labeled a 'stone weapon', the etchings, wear, and sound produced when it strikes indicate that the hammer is in fact made of metal.

        Kos Parasite
        
        
        When the carcass of Kos washed up on the coast, its insides were teeming with tiny parasites, unlike any found in humans. 
        This atypical weapon can only be clasped tight and swung, but a Kos Parasite is said to stimulate phantasms inhabiting a lumenwood"
        
        
        
        Dropped by Orphan of Kos
        
        
        
        The Kos Parasite is perhaps the most interestingly unique weapon in Bloodborne in various ways: It is one of two weapons that can reach it's full potential while using a rune (the other being Beast Claw), the weapon itself is not held, it is purely an arcane weapon, it is the only weapon directly dropped by defeating a boss, it has the highest durability of any weapon at 600 respectively, it is the only weapon to have an A-scaling of any weapon without any upgrades and is the only weapon to have an S-scaling by upgrading it twice.

        Ludwig's Holy Blade
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. It is said that the silver sword was employed by Ludwig, the first hunter of the church. When transformed, it combines with its sheath to form a greatsword. 
        It exhibits several departures from the workshop's design, suggesting that the Church anticipated much larger inhuman beasts."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased for 20,000 echoes from the Messengers after obtaining the Radiant Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon was wielded by Ludwig, a famous hunter of the Healing Church who designed the blade based on the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        According to the description, Ludwig wielded this sword in combat instead of the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        However, in his boss fight, he wields the Holy Moonlight Sword during a certain part in the fight.
        It is possible that Ludwig wielded the Holy Moonlight Sword and his fellow hunters, inspired by the huge weapon, sought to make replicas. Unable to make a magic sword, a huge metal sheath was the compromise.
        Before the DLC's release, Ludwig's Holy Blade was thought of as From Software's traditional "Moonlight Greatsword" seen throughout various games by the fanbase.
        However, this sword was eventually revealed in the DLC to be a replica of the "true" Moonlight Greatsword in Bloodborne, the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        This isn't the first time Miyazaki used the name of classical music composers in a game.
        A boss from the first "Dark Souls" game, Dragonslayer Ornstein, is named after Leo Ornstein.
        Berlioz from "Armored Core 4" is named after Hector Berlioz.
        The normal form of this weapon is very similar to the sword used for the Kirkhammer.
        However, this sword's normal form has a slightly longer reach when compared to the Kirkhammer's blade.
        The similar nature of these swords suggests that the Healing Church used the method of interchangeable parts to quickly mass produce weapons for their hunters.

        Rakuyo
        
        
        Hunter weapon wielded by Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower. 
        A trick sword originated in the same country as the Cainhurst Chikage, only this sword feeds not off blood, but instead demands great dexterity. 
        Lady Maria was fond of this aspect of the Rakuyo, as she frowned upon blood blades, despite being a distant relative of the queen. 
        One day, she abandoned her beloved Rakuyo, casting it into a dark well, when she could stomach it no longer."
        
        
        
        Fishing Hamlet. Get to the bottom of the well. Can be reached from the underground tunnels at the end of the area or via a ladder in the well right away. In that area a Shark Giant will wander around. Fighting him makes a second one appear after the first reaches sufficiently low health. The first giant will walk over near the ladder and scream at the ceiling, causing the second one to drop. The second one drops the weapon.
        Fighting the two of them can be difficult and it is a good idea to use the Shaman Bone Blade to make them fight each other and finish off the weaker one. Molotov cocktails are also very effective against them. If neither is available to you, try to kill the one with the anchor first, as it is significantly harder to dodge.
        One easy way to beat them is use of ranged weapon like Simon's Bowblade if you are a bloodtinge build, and the Holy Moonlight Sword if you are an arcane build.
        A Threaded Cane's transformed whip can easily hit the giants from the ledge once they're lured over and begin attacking, but be sure to keep your distance after each hit. Except that there is no way to lure them over the the ledge. No ranged weapon will hit the one standing at the back and the one hanging from the ceiling doesn't drop down until the first one is at 50% health. 
        Unlike other giants in the game, these ones are easy to gun parry for a visceral attack. Keep in mind this will get very tricky after the other one starts fighting, so try to separate them and time your viscerals to get the invincibility at the right moment.
        If your range is inadequate you can use the monocular to angle a throwing knife to be able to hit the shark giant in the back. This way, you can continue from the strategy of killing them on the ledge with a gun/magic without going around. (confirmed as of January 19th, 2019)
        Chaining together backstabs is a very effecient way of dealing with them, if played right you should be able to eliminate the first shark giant before the second reaches you this way. It is extremely difficult to get behind the patrolling Shark Giant without him detecting you. 
        For a video showing an easy way to kill the sharks with a monocular and a throwing knife strategy, check .
        
        
        
        Rakuyo (ËêΩËëâ) literally means "falling leaf".
        The sword of Rakuyo bears resemblance to the "ky≈´ gunt≈ç", which was a hybrid of the sabre/katana with a handguard, used during the Russo-Japanese War.

        Reiterpallasch
        
        
        Weapon wielded by the Knights of Cainhurst. 
        Combines an elegant knight's sword with the peculiar firearm wielded by the Cainhurst order. 
        The old nobles, long-time imbibers of blood, are no strangers to the sanguine plague, and the disposal of beasts was a discrete task left to their servants, or knights, as they were called for the sake of appearances."
        
        
        
        It's found in a chest located in the entrance hall of Cainhurst Castle, where the Bound Widows are first encountered. When you first enter the room from the main entrance, run towards your two o'clock. The chest will be found in a corner.
        
        
        
        The Reiterpallasch (from German Reiter "horseback rider" and hungarian pallos [Ààp…ílo É] "sword") is a 17th century Hungarian straight sword with a typically double edged blade and guarded hilt that was used by Hungarian noble cavalry and later adapted by most western European armies.
        As pointed out in its description, the rifle spear is made "possibly in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon" (i.e. this one).
        Wynne D. Fanchon from Armored Core: For Answer; another From Software title, pilots a NEXT named Reiterpallasch.

        Rifle Spear
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. A prototype weapon serving as a simple firearm and spear, possibly created in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon. Lacks any notable functions, saving that it is the only trick weapon with an attached gun. "
        
        
        
        It can be found inside a hidden building in Old Yharnam. From the area you fight the first NPC Hunter (who wields a saw spear), drop down where the railing is missing in a corner and land on the ledges below. Go into the building and follow the stairs up; eventually you can find it stashed on a corpse tucked away in a hidden nook as you advance.
        Bought from the messengers for 4000 blood echoes after acquiring the Powder Keg Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        According to the Rifle Spear's description, it was designed as an imitation of "a lost Cainhurst weapon".
        That particular weapon may or may not be the Reiterpallasch.
        It should be noted these two weapons are the only two skill/firearm hybrids whose alternate forms utilize guns.
        The third skill/firearm hybrid weapon in this game is Simon's Bowblade, which transforms from a sword into a bow.
        The Rifle Spear is carried by a Yahar'Gul Hunter in the Cathedral Ward.
        This fight can be tricky because you first encounter a Yahar'Gul Hunter that uses a Tonitrus near the base of the stairs, and if you advance too far towards the houses, the Rifle Spear Yahar'Gul Hunter will join the fight as well.
        He also uses Ludwig's Rifle, meaning he can hit you from a considerable distance with shotgun pellets no matter what mode he uses for the Rifle Spear.

        Saw Cleaver
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used in the hunting business. 
        This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts, transforms into a long cleaver that makes use of centrifugal force. 
        The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness the more grotesquely transformed the beast."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired as a gift from the Messengers the first time you visit the Hunter's Dream.
        If you don't select it, you may buy it after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne.)
        
        
        
        The Saw Cleaver is the Trick Weapon featured on the title screen.
        It was also one of the first weapons to be revealed for this game.
        Overall the mechanisms of this weapon didn't change at all, starting all the way back when Bloodborne was still known as "Project Beast."
        According to the concept art, the Saw Cleaver uses a trigger mechanism to unlock the joint during transformation.
        The design of the Saw Cleaver seems to be inspired by multiple references:
        The transformed cleaver shows a resemblance to LB-66 MOONLIGHT from Armored Core V.
        The Japanese name is written as "nokogiri nata" („Éé„Ç≥„ÇÆ„É™Èâà) or "saw hatchet". Nokogiri is a traditional Japanese saw that cuts from the pull stroke, as opposed to the more common push stroke.
        In real life, there is a type of cleaver known as a mezzaluna ("half moon") cleaver, known for chopping/mincing up various food products.
        Most of these types of cleavers have handles on both ends.
        However, some use a single handle that stretches across the blade, which was used to chop up herbs usually; the saw cleaver follows this particular model.
        Coincidentally, the Strength/Skill/Arcane scaling at maximum level is "CDC" in their respective order.
        The CDC is an American organization designed to combat and prevent "health threats" of varying natures.
        Since the beast scourge acts like a plague (and is spread due to blood-related reasons), those who wield the Saw Cleaver can be thought of as fighting a dangerous epidemic.
        Henryk uses this weapon when he fights you and Eileen the Crow during her questline, as well as when he is summoned by you when using the Old Hunter Bell.

        Simon despised firearms, and so the Church workshop had this specially fashioned to his liking. The large curved blade serves as a bow when transformed.
        But aside from a few close friends, Simon was scoffed at for his choice of arms, for who would dare face the beasts with a measly bow?"

        The stake driver, with its queerly complex design, violently drives thick stakes into the flesh of foes. 
        The stake driver allows for high-damage critical attacks, but is difficult to use and leaves its wielder wide open, but none of this should bother a mere Powder Keg."
        
        
        
        Obtain Powder Keg Hunter Badge to unlock for purchase at the Messengers for 8,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Stake Driver is exclusively wielded by Djura when he is still hostile towards you.
        His fight is tricky because the area around him is very limited, meaning you can fall to your death if you're not careful.
        Furthermore, the limited space is perfect for his choice of weapon which has a short range.
        This is modeled after the "Pile Bunker," a type of fictional weaponry which launches piston with gunpowder or explosion.
        In the Japanese version of Bloodborne, this weapon is literally called the Pile Hammer („Éë„Ç§„É´„Éè„É≥„Éû„Éº).
        It bears a striking resemblance to the "Parrying Blade" weapons seen in several "Armored Core" games.
        Has the highest charged attack multiplier out of any other weapon.

        Threaded Cane
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used by hunters on their duties. Sufficiently deadly as a rigid bladed cane, but also serves as a whip when its blade is split into many. Concealing the weapon inside the cane and flogging the beasts with the whip is partly an act of ceremony, an attempt to demonstrate to oneself that the bloodlust of the hunt will never encroach upon the soul."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired at the beginning of the game as a gift from the Messengers.
        If not selected, it is later available for purchase from the blood fountain messengers after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne).
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is used by Iosefka, Last Scholar Yurie and the Frontier Church Hunter.
        Gehrman carries a generic cane in the Workshop instead of the Threaded Cane.
        This trick weapon is possibly inspired by the sword used by Jean-Fran√ßois de Morangias in the climactic battle of French action-horror film Brotherhood of the Wolf (which bears many other similarities to Bloodborne), or the sword used by a bandit leader in the anime/manga series Claymore. Both these weapons act as a straight, double-edged sword that can transform into a segmented, bladed whip.
        
        
    

        Logarius's Wheel
        
        
        "Weapon wielded by martyr Logarius' band of executioners. 
        Used to slaughter the Vilebloods in Cainhurst. Bathed in pools of their blood, and forever steeped in their ire. 
        Transform to release the power of the wheel and manifest their lingering rage in a show of utter brilliance."
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 13,000 Blood Echoes after acquiring the Wheel Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        Alfred utilizes the Logarius' Wheel when found in Cainhurst Castle.
        This weapon is yet another reference to Berserk, as they are often made in Miyazaki's previous Souls games.
        "Logarius and his band of executioners" bear many similarities to Mozgus, an insanely devout man who traveled the land torturing heretics along with his disciples.
        The wheel in particular was wielded by one of his six disciples, .
        In Dark Souls, Bonewheel Skeletons are another reference to Mozgus' disciples.
        In real life, although wheels weren't typically wielded as weapons, they were commonly used as torture devices, especially during the Middle Ages.
        Torture wheels were nicknamed "breaking wheels," since victims often times would have their limbs broken during the process.
        They were also known as "catherine wheels."
         It's quite possible that Logarius' Wheel also takes some inspiration in its use as a weapon from the English folklore legend of Tom Hickathrift. Tom was a fabled giant killer who made use of a cartwheel to vanquish the Wisbech Giant (also referred to as an ogre).

        Tonitrus
        
        
        "A unique trick weapon contrived by Archibald, the infamous eccentric of the Healing Church workshop. 
        Striking this peculiar iron morning star flail like a match generates the same blue sparks that blanket a darkbeast. 
        Unfortunately, for reasons untold, the hunters of Archibald's time did not fully take to the device."
        
        
        
        Acquire the Spark Hunter Badge by defeating Darkbeast Paarl  to purchase from Messengers.
        Treasure: Yahar'gul, Unseen Village, at the top end of the road. (guarded by 2 Tainted Dogs and a Snatcher during daytime)
        
        
        
        Tonitrus is a Latin word meaning "thunder."
        The in-game description classifies this trick weapon as a morning star flail, but it's actually modeled in the form of a mace.
        The description of Archibald bears many similarities to Nikola Tesla, a famed inventor in real life who specialized in the field of electricity.
        Nikola Tesla created the Tesla Coil, a device that also bears many similarities to the Tonitrus.
        The Tonitrus also bears similarities with the aspergillum, a device used by the Roman Catholic Church to sprinkle holy water.
        According to the description of the Spark Hunter Badge, Archibald was associated with the Healing Church.
        In this sense, it may have been designed under the themes of "purificiation" and "cleansing" that is associated with many Healing Church trick weapons/tools.
        However, due to Archibald's fascination with Dark Beasts, it's more likely he designed the Tonitrus as a measure to replicate the sparks these creatures could unleash.

        Whirligig Saw
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs, and weapon of choice of the Old Hunter Valtr, the Beast Eater. 
        This weapon pummels beasts in its mace form, but its true strength lies in its attached mechanical saws. 
        These discs, lined with serrated teeth,spin rapidly, thrashing the flesh of beasts into fine shreds."
        
        
        
        From the Nightmare Church go down the stairs and follow the path. Drop down into the pools of blood of follow the path further until you reach the Cannon Executioner. Follow the left wall and turn down the path, the weapon is at the end.
        
        
        
        If you use the L2 buzzsaw attack against Orphan of Kos and hold it in place, it attempts to make an immediate counterattack for each time it gets hit by the whirring blades, only to get interrupted by the next hit. It shrieks every time it attacks, so as a result, it lets loose dozens of overlapping shriek sound effects for as long as you hold it in place.
        A whirligig is defined as a toy that is constantly spinning, such as a top or pinwheel, or as something regarded as hectic and constantly changing.
        Similar to most Powder Keg weapons sharing homage to Armored Core weapons, the Whirligig Saw is based on the Grind Blade.
        
    

        Ludwig's Holy Blade
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. It is said that the silver sword was employed by Ludwig, the first hunter of the church. When transformed, it combines with its sheath to form a greatsword. 
        It exhibits several departures from the workshop's design, suggesting that the Church anticipated much larger inhuman beasts."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased for 20,000 echoes from the Messengers after obtaining the Radiant Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon was wielded by Ludwig, a famous hunter of the Healing Church who designed the blade based on the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        According to the description, Ludwig wielded this sword in combat instead of the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        However, in his boss fight, he wields the Holy Moonlight Sword during a certain part in the fight.
        It is possible that Ludwig wielded the Holy Moonlight Sword and his fellow hunters, inspired by the huge weapon, sought to make replicas. Unable to make a magic sword, a huge metal sheath was the compromise.
        Before the DLC's release, Ludwig's Holy Blade was thought of as From Software's traditional "Moonlight Greatsword" seen throughout various games by the fanbase.
        However, this sword was eventually revealed in the DLC to be a replica of the "true" Moonlight Greatsword in Bloodborne, the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        This isn't the first time Miyazaki used the name of classical music composers in a game.
        A boss from the first "Dark Souls" game, Dragonslayer Ornstein, is named after Leo Ornstein.
        Berlioz from "Armored Core 4" is named after Hector Berlioz.
        The normal form of this weapon is very similar to the sword used for the Kirkhammer.
        However, this sword's normal form has a slightly longer reach when compared to the Kirkhammer's blade.
        The similar nature of these swords suggests that the Healing Church used the method of interchangeable parts to quickly mass produce weapons for their hunters.
        Lore theories exist under Ebrietas Lore.

        Amygdalan Arm 
        
        
        The arm of a small Amygdala Great One. 
        Strictly speaking, the Amygdalan Arm is no trick weapon of any sort, but certain madmen wield them like clubs. 
        Starts as a large, tough blunt weapon formed of bone, but when extended, the hand quivers as if it were still alive.
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare, cave at the end of the blood river to the right after getting out of the building that used to be the shortcut to the Cleric Beast in the main game. Gatling Gun Hunter dropping the Gatling Gun and a Blood-Starved Beast can be also found here. Arm is near the Blood-Starved Beast at the end of the cave.
        
        
        
        The Amygdalan Arm is a Trick Weapon in name only, considering that it is an arm obtained from Amygdala.
        The arm is remarkably small, as even the Lesser Amygdalae are huge. Perhaps it came from a newborn Amygdala.
        The arm could be the inspiration behind the Burial Blade.

        Crafted by chiseling the long bones of an undead darkbeast and fastening them to the weapon. The bones are still alive, and when unleashed, grant its wielder a spurt of beastly power. 
        As flesh is flayed and blood is sprayed, the beast within awakens, and in time, the wielder of this weapon surges with both strength and feverish reverie."

        Can be bought from messengers for 34000 echoes after acquisition.
        Can be bought from messengers after co-operation with player who has them. This only occurs in Hunter's dream before fight with Gehrman or Moon Presence. It is not needed to complete any Chalice Dungeons. It is unknown if this is glitch or intentional. Was patched by 1.07 or 1.08.
        
        
        
        When this weapon is equipped, your gloves will be replaced by two bone gauntlets. This can allow for the lost art of rapid glove changing if you switch your weapons really fast.
        You can charge the beasthood meter on the first windows (Gilbert) of Central Yharnam
        In the past, there was a rare glitch that allowed a player to obtain this weapon without finding it in the Chalice Dungeons.
        It has since been patched, although it isn't quite known when it was successfully patched.

        A second blade is found inside the curve of the main one. In its initial form, the saif can be wielded like a long curved sword, but when transformed, its blade is contracted, allowing for quick, repeated stabs. 
        Although this trick weapon allows for adaptive combat, it was later replaced by saws and similar weapons that were more effective at disposing of beasts."

        A trick weapon used by Old Hunters. 
        This thick iron cleaver slices through the toughest of beast hides, and when transformed the blade splits into sections, allowing one to lash it in the fashion of a heavy whip. 
        This crude weapon relies on brute force and is regrettably inelegant, suggesting that the hunts of the earliest hunters made for horrific affairs, painted in sanguine black and reds."

        Reminds many of the Zanpakut≈ç , a fictional segmented sword that can function as a whip. It is an iconic weapon from the Bleach anime.

        A special trick weapon passed down among hunters of hunters. One of the oldest weapons of the workshop. 
        Splits into two when activated. The weapon's warped blades are forged with siderite, a rare mineral of the heavens. Most effective swift attacks,such as after a quick-stepping."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers for 40000 echoes after obtaining the Crow Hunter Badge from Eileen the Crow's quest line.
        Killing Eileen is also a way to get the weapon early in the game.
        While progressing through Eileen's quest, it's possible for her to be killed by Henryk and thus drop the Crow Hunter Badge as a result, although the quest line will end.
        
        
        
        The Blade of Mercy was originally named as "Warped Twinblades" during the Alpha test, and it was the tool of choice for the "agile" hunter.
        Both the Burial Blade and Blade of Mercy make mentions of a mineral known as siderite in their descriptions.
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite, and it seems to be the reason why arcane power has direct scaling with both blade's damage output. Due to its extraterrestrial origins, that may explain why it cannot be buffed by an external source of any sort.
        It loosely resembles the Eleum Loyce from Dark Souls 2, a sword with two blades at the front.

        This trick weapon was wielded by Ludwig, a famous hunter of the Healing Church who designed the blade based on the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        According to the description, Ludwig wielded this sword in combat instead of the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        However, in his boss fight, he wields the Holy Moonlight Sword during a certain part in the fight.
        It is possible that Ludwig wielded the Holy Moonlight Sword and his fellow hunters, inspired by the huge weapon, sought to make replicas. Unable to make a magic sword, a huge metal sheath was the compromise.
        Before the DLC's release, Ludwig's Holy Blade was thought of as From Software's traditional "Moonlight Greatsword" seen throughout various games by the fanbase.
        However, this sword was eventually revealed in the DLC to be a replica of the "true" Moonlight Greatsword in Bloodborne, the Holy Moonlight Sword.

        The normal form of this weapon is very similar to the sword used for the Kirkhammer.
        However, this sword's normal form has a slightly longer reach when compared to the Kirkhammer's blade.
        The similar nature of these swords suggests that the Healing Church used the method of interchangeable parts to quickly mass produce weapons for their hunters.

        Bloodletter
        
        
        The demented hunter weapon brandished by Brador, the Healing Church assassin. 
        The Bloodletter assumes its true and terrifying form after it draws upon blood from the inner reaches of one's body and soul. 
        This is the only effective means of expelling tainted blood, or so Brador, isolated in his cell, continued to believe."
        
        
        
        Obtain the underground cell inner chamber key.
        Return to the underground prison (from the underground corpse pile lamp, go up the stairs and turn left) and open the door to Brador's cell. His cell is the second on the left behind a flight of downward stairs. Kill Brador to obtain the bloodletter.
        Brador will not be hostile in his cell, but will invade the player right outside his cell.

        Boom Hammer
        
        
        A trick weapon used by the old hunters, and crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. 
        A giant hammer equipped with a miniature furnace. When ignited and fired, it emits a volley of flame that explodes furiously upon impact. 
        Crush the beasts, then burn them - the brute simplicity of the Boom Hammer was favored by hunters with an acute distaste for beasts."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare. Inside a house that looks out of Central Yharnam, the same that is the shortcut to the cleric beast in the main game, where the 10 quicksilver bullets used to be. Be sure to shoot the explosives around the item (or act fast), as the wheelchair huntsman's corpse conceals a delayed molotov set to trigger when you try to grab the Boom Hammer, potential killing you in a huge blast.
        
        
        
        When the Boomhammer is lit, Beast Patient mobs will back away from the player as if they had a torch equipped. (May need to initiate primed attack first)

        Burial Blade
        
        
        Trick weapon wielded by Gehrman, the first hunter." 
        A masterpiece that defined the entire array of weapons crafted at the workshop. Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens. 
        Gehrman surely saw the hunt as a dirge of farewell, wishing only that his prey might rest in peace, never again to awaken to another harrowing nightmare. "
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 60,000 Blood Echoes after defeating Gehrman, the First Hunter and acquiring the Old Hunter Badge from him.
        To make Gehrman fight you, the "Refuse" option must be selected.
        If one accepts his proposal, the game will outright end there and it will be impossible to obtain this weapon in that playthrough (not including the uncanny/lost forms found in the chalice dungeons).
        Normally, the Burial Blade can only be obtained in NG+ and beyond. However, one can bypass this by using Bold Hunter's Mark, or being killed, during The Moon Presence boss battle.
        
        
        
         The Burial Blade was the first trick weapon ever created, and it inspired others to develop new trick weapons, usually on the premise of adapting to different combat scenerios.
        Not all weapons adapt to different combat scenerios (e.g. Tonitrus), but the Burial Blade still inspired an entire series of weapons that could "transform" to satisfy different purposes.
        It was created, and exclusively wielded, by Gehrman.
        A Burial Blade can be found above the workshop table in the Hunter's Dream.
        The weapon's description mentions that "Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens."
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite. Due to its extraterrestrial nature, it could be the reason why it has direct scaling with arcane and cannot be tampered by external sources.
        Both the Burial Blade and the Blade of Mercy mentions the use of it in their descriptions.
        Interestingly enough, these two weapons also resemble the talons of Mergo's Wet Nurse.
        The shape of the scythe highly resembles Rurufon's scythe from Shadow Tower Abyss, an early title created by From Software as well as being recurring weapons in Souls series.
        A strange bug on rare occurrences the cape on the hunter may come off, usually in a boss fight you could notice if you dodge back and do an R1 combo the cape disappears. [Note, I haven't seen this happen in a while, it's possible that it may have been fixed, but I'll need confirmation on this]

        Chikage
        
        
        Foreign-made weapon wielded by the royal guards who protect Annalise, Queen of the Vilebloods at Cainhurst Castle. 
        When the intricate, rippled engraving that spans the Chikage's blade is imbrued with blood, the sword sings in scarlet hues. 
        However, the rite eats away at the wielder's very essence."
        
        
        
        Join the Cainhurst Vilebloods covenant available at Cainhurst Castle, and then purchase from the Messengers for 50,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Chikage isn't actually a katana - it is a katana/european sword hybrid. Its short crossguard resembles the one of an early viking sword, or the one of a xiphos (greek sword). The closest european crossguard shape with  this sword is the one of a Karabela (a polish sabre). In other hand, the  hilt and pommel resemble the ones of a longsword (a bit longer, to get easier katana traditional jutsu swings), while the blade shape and the 2-handed fighting style is very similar to a katana. A possible explanation for the origin of this hybrid is that the katana's design was imported to Cainhurst, where some modifications were made to create a sword similar to that commonly used by their knights.
        The Chikage is an allusion to a particular 'breed' of Katanas in the Souls games. While it is similar to both the Hiltless and Chaos Blade from Demon's Souls and Dark Souls respectively, the Chikage bears a stronger resemblance to the Magic Sword "Makoto" (also from Demon's Souls). The Makoto is the only one the bunch to actually DRAIN the user's HP over time, rather than decrease it with each successful swing.
        Chikage (ÂçÉÊôØ) literally means "Thousands Views", however if you separated the word into Chi Kage (Ë°ÄÂΩ±), it means "Blood Shadow". This could be correlated to the fact that Shadows Of Yharnam wield a similar katana with a slight  crossguard, however without using the bloodtinge.
        The transforming attack has the hunter sheathe the Chikage before unleashing a strike. This is a reference to Iaijutsu, a traditional Japanese sword technique that focuses on quick-drawing. At its finest, Iaijutse allows the warrior to unsheathe and strike at incredible speeds.
        The name seems to be a tribute to Chikage Yamamura (mentioned as a "special thanks" in credits)
        The name may also be a reference to the work "1000 Plateaus" by Giles Deluze and Felix Guattari, a famous philosophical essay about fluidity and functionality, maybe dirrectly tied to the esoteric nature of the weapons function.

        Church Pick
        
        
        One of the old trick weapons of the Healing Church, a hunting weapon formed from one of the giant picks that appear in old beast tales. 
        The Church Pick initially serves as a large sword, but when transformed functions as an extended war pick. In spite of its origins, it is a highly practical weapon."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Dropped by a hunter wearing Yahar'Gul set (presumably, this is the summonable Old Hunter Defector Antal) in one of the cells that you open with the Underground Cell Key from the Research Hall. To make this battle simple, attack him through the door with a strong R2 attack, then leave the room. He will lose sight of you and his AI will return to a standstill behind the door. Rinse and repeat until dead.
        
        
        
        The Church Pick And The Hunter's Axe both have similar appearance. When transformed, both are wielded as a polearm and have the same de-transformation attack. The only difference apart from the Church Pick having a slightly more complicated mechanism is that the Hunter's Axe is a strength-based weapon.
        A few of its attacks in the transformed mode are very similar to that of the Burial Blade.

        Holy Moonlight Sword
        
        
        An arcane sword discovered long ago by Ludwig. 
        When blue moonlight dances around the sword, and it channels the abyssal cosmos, its great blade will hurl a shadowy lightwave. 
        The Holy Moonlight Sword is synonymous with Ludwig, the Holy Blade, but few have ever set eyes on the great blade, and whatever guidance it has to offer, it seems to be of a very private, elusive sort."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Found on the Underground Corpse Pile after the fight against Ludwig, The Holy Blade. Ludwig's head will be lying there and you can:
        Kill the head for the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and talk to the head. When prompted, reply "Yes" and you'll get the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and reply "No", then come back later and Simon the Harrowed will be there and give you the sword.
        NOTE: This weapon is missable. If Lawrence is killed before you obtain it, you will no longer be able to talk to the head or obtain it from Simon.
        
        
        
        It seems to be another reappearance of the Moonlight Greatsword, a recurring item found around FromSoftware's games. Notable examples of such games include the first, second and third Dark Souls games, Demon's Souls, King's Field, Ninja Blade, Enchanted Arms, Armored Core, 3D Dot Game Heroes, and Otogi.

        Hunter Axe
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used on the hunt. Retains the qualities of an axe, but offers a wider palette of attacks by transforming. Boasts a heavy blunt attack, leading to high rally potential. No matter their pasts, beasts are no more than beasts. Some choose this axe to play the part of executioner."
        
        
        
        It's possible to pick this trick weapon as a starting weapon near the beginning of Bloodborne.
        If not chosen, it can instead be purchased from the Messengers after the Hunter has found the Saw Hunter Badge.

        However, he has a moveset that is different from the Hunter's version.
        He is also capable of using his unique Hunter Pistol even while his Hunter Axe is transformed, which is impossible for the Hunter to do.
        It's also wielded by the Madara's Twin who drops Madara's Whistle when defeated.
        Another hostile hunter NPC wields this trick weapon in the Nightmare Frontier.
        It's been heavily debated by the fanbase whether the transformed mode is a halberd or poleaxe.
        Both forms utilized axe heads with a spear tip at the end (although some poleaxes used hammer heads instead).
        However, neither weapon was known to have extendable handles, which is a special trademark of the Hunter Axe.
        In either case, it's possible this trick weapon was inspired by both weapons and simply incorporated many different designs.
        While wielded in it's transformed mode if the player had a torch equipped in the off-hand beasts afraid of the fire will still recoil in fear of you as if you were brandishing the torch normally (Tested on Beast Patient)
        
        
    

        Ludwig's Holy Blade
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. It is said that the silver sword was employed by Ludwig, the first hunter of the church. When transformed, it combines with its sheath to form a greatsword. 
        It exhibits several departures from the workshop's design, suggesting that the Church anticipated much larger inhuman beasts."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased for 20,000 echoes from the Messengers after obtaining the Radiant Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon was wielded by Ludwig, a famous hunter of the Healing Church who designed the blade based on the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        According to the description, Ludwig wielded this sword in combat instead of the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        However, in his boss fight, he wields the Holy Moonlight Sword during a certain part in the fight.
        It is possible that Ludwig wielded the Holy Moonlight Sword and his fellow hunters, inspired by the huge weapon, sought to make replicas. Unable to make a magic sword, a huge metal sheath was the compromise.
        Before the DLC's release, Ludwig's Holy Blade was thought of as From Software's traditional "Moonlight Greatsword" seen throughout various games by the fanbase.
        However, this sword was eventually revealed in the DLC to be a replica of the "true" Moonlight Greatsword in Bloodborne, the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        This isn't the first time Miyazaki used the name of classical music composers in a game.
        A boss from the first "Dark Souls" game, Dragonslayer Ornstein, is named after Leo Ornstein.
        Berlioz from "Armored Core 4" is named after Hector Berlioz.
        The normal form of this weapon is very similar to the sword used for the Kirkhammer.
        However, this sword's normal form has a slightly longer reach when compared to the Kirkhammer's blade.
        The similar nature of these swords suggests that the Healing Church used the method of interchangeable parts to quickly mass produce weapons for their hunters.

        Kirkhammer
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. On the one side, an easily handled silver sword. On the other, a giant obtuse stone weapon, characterized by a blunt strike and extreme force of impact. The Church takes a heavy-handed, merciless stance toward the plague of beasts, an irony not lost upon the wielders of this most symbolic weapon."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers after acquiring the Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        A miniature of the Kirkhammer was included as the Pre-Order Bonus for Asian editions of Bloodborne. [See the Bundles page for details]
        A "kirk" is an archaic old english word meaning "church."
        This means the weapon is literately known as the Church Hammer.
        The wording also might be a nod to Nordic culture since the word "Kirk" originated from northern England and Old Norse wording.
        The etched wording on the side of the hammer part has similarities to the Old Norse alphabet.
        However, it also has similarities to the Elder Futhark, one of the oldest forms of the runic alphabet system used by Germanic tribes.
        Similar etchings can be found on gravestones all over Yharnam.
        The sword used for this weapon is very similar to the one used for Ludwig's Holy Blade.
        This suggests that the Healing Church used the method of "interchangeable parts" to efficiently mass produce weapons for their hunters.
        However, the sword used for the Kirkhammer is shorter.
        It's wielded by Alfred, should you choose to be friends with him.
        He uses this weapon as a summon.
        However, he wields the Logarius' Wheel if you find him in Cainhurst Castle under special circumstances.
        When untransformed, with the hammer part on the character's back, some cloth parts (capes etc.) of the armor can either get awkwardly stuck on it or cover it.
        Despite being labeled a 'stone weapon', the etchings, wear, and sound produced when it strikes indicate that the hammer is in fact made of metal.

        Kos Parasite
        
        
        When the carcass of Kos washed up on the coast, its insides were teeming with tiny parasites, unlike any found in humans. 
        This atypical weapon can only be clasped tight and swung, but a Kos Parasite is said to stimulate phantasms inhabiting a lumenwood"
        
        
        
        Dropped by Orphan of Kos
        
        
        
        The Kos Parasite is perhaps the most interestingly unique weapon in Bloodborne in various ways: It is one of two weapons that can reach it's full potential while using a rune (the other being Beast Claw), the weapon itself is not held, it is purely an arcane weapon, it is the only weapon directly dropped by defeating a boss, it has the highest durability of any weapon at 600 respectively, it is the only weapon to have an A-scaling of any weapon without any upgrades and is the only weapon to have an S-scaling by upgrading it twice.

        Logarius's Wheel
        
        
        "Weapon wielded by martyr Logarius' band of executioners. 
        Used to slaughter the Vilebloods in Cainhurst. Bathed in pools of their blood, and forever steeped in their ire. 
        Transform to release the power of the wheel and manifest their lingering rage in a show of utter brilliance."
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 13,000 Blood Echoes after acquiring the Wheel Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        Alfred utilizes the Logarius' Wheel when found in Cainhurst Castle.
        This weapon is yet another reference to Berserk, as they are often made in Miyazaki's previous Souls games.
        "Logarius and his band of executioners" bear many similarities to Mozgus, an insanely devout man who traveled the land torturing heretics along with his disciples.
        The wheel in particular was wielded by one of his six disciples, .
        In Dark Souls, Bonewheel Skeletons are another reference to Mozgus' disciples.
        In real life, although wheels weren't typically wielded as weapons, they were commonly used as torture devices, especially during the Middle Ages.
        Torture wheels were nicknamed "breaking wheels," since victims often times would have their limbs broken during the process.
        They were also known as "catherine wheels."
         It's quite possible that Logarius' Wheel also takes some inspiration in its use as a weapon from the English folklore legend of Tom Hickathrift. Tom was a fabled giant killer who made use of a cartwheel to vanquish the Wisbech Giant (also referred to as an ogre).
        Lore theories can be found under "From Berserk to Bloodborne".

        Rakuyo
        
        
        Hunter weapon wielded by Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower. 
        A trick sword originated in the same country as the Cainhurst Chikage, only this sword feeds not off blood, but instead demands great dexterity. 
        Lady Maria was fond of this aspect of the Rakuyo, as she frowned upon blood blades, despite being a distant relative of the queen. 
        One day, she abandoned her beloved Rakuyo, casting it into a dark well, when she could stomach it no longer."
        
        
        
        Fishing Hamlet. Get to the bottom of the well. Can be reached from the underground tunnels at the end of the area or via a ladder in the well right away. In that area a Shark Giant will wander around. Fighting him makes a second one appear after the first reaches sufficiently low health. The first giant will walk over near the ladder and scream at the ceiling, causing the second one to drop. The second one drops the weapon.
        Fighting the two of them can be difficult and it is a good idea to use the Shaman Bone Blade to make them fight each other and finish off the weaker one. Molotov cocktails are also very effective against them. If neither is available to you, try to kill the one with the anchor first, as it is significantly harder to dodge.
        One easy way to beat them is use of ranged weapon like Simon's Bowblade if you are a bloodtinge build, and the Holy Moonlight Sword if you are an arcane build.
        A Threaded Cane's transformed whip can easily hit the giants from the ledge once they're lured over and begin attacking, but be sure to keep your distance after each hit. Except that there is no way to lure them over the the ledge. No ranged weapon will hit the one standing at the back and the one hanging from the ceiling doesn't drop down until the first one is at 50% health. 
        Unlike other giants in the game, these ones are easy to gun parry for a visceral attack. Keep in mind this will get very tricky after the other one starts fighting, so try to separate them and time your viscerals to get the invincibility at the right moment.
        If your range is inadequate you can use the monocular to angle a throwing knife to be able to hit the shark giant in the back. This way, you can continue from the strategy of killing them on the ledge with a gun/magic without going around. (confirmed as of January 19th, 2019)
        Chaining together backstabs is a very effecient way of dealing with them, if played right you should be able to eliminate the first shark giant before the second reaches you this way. It is extremely difficult to get behind the patrolling Shark Giant without him detecting you. 
        For a video showing an easy way to kill the sharks with a monocular and a throwing knife strategy, check .
        
        
        
        Rakuyo (ËêΩËëâ) literally means "falling leaf".
        The sword of Rakuyo bears resemblance to the "ky≈´ gunt≈ç", which was a hybrid of the sabre/katana with a handguard, used during the Russo-Japanese War.

        Weapon wielded by the Knights of Cainhurst. 
        Combines an elegant knight's sword with the peculiar firearm wielded by the Cainhurst order. 
        The old nobles, long-time imbibers of blood, are no strangers to the sanguine plague, and the disposal of beasts was a discrete task left to their servants, or knights, as they were called for the sake of appearances."

        The Reiterpallasch (from German Reiter "horseback rider" and hungarian pallos [Ààp…ílo É] "sword") is a 17th century Hungarian straight sword with a typically double edged blade and guarded hilt that was used by Hungarian noble cavalry and later adapted by most western European armies.
        As pointed out in its description, the rifle spear is made "possibly in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon" (i.e. this one).

        Berlioz from "Armored Core 4" is named after Hector Berlioz.
        The normal form of this weapon is very similar to the sword used for the Kirkhammer.
        However, this sword's normal form has a slightly longer reach when compared to the Kirkhammer's blade.
        The similar nature of these swords suggests that the Healing Church used the method of interchangeable parts to quickly mass produce weapons for their hunters.

        Rifle Spear
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. A prototype weapon serving as a simple firearm and spear, possibly created in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon. Lacks any notable functions, saving that it is the only trick weapon with an attached gun. "
        
        
        
        It can be found inside a hidden building in Old Yharnam. From the area you fight the first NPC Hunter (who wields a saw spear), drop down where the railing is missing in a corner and land on the ledges below. Go into the building and follow the stairs up; eventually you can find it stashed on a corpse tucked away in a hidden nook as you advance.
        Bought from the messengers for 4000 blood echoes after acquiring the Powder Keg Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        According to the Rifle Spear's description, it was designed as an imitation of "a lost Cainhurst weapon".
        That particular weapon may or may not be the Reiterpallasch.
        It should be noted these two weapons are the only two skill/firearm hybrids whose alternate forms utilize guns.
        The third skill/firearm hybrid weapon in this game is Simon's Bowblade, which transforms from a sword into a bow.
        The Rifle Spear is carried by a Yahar'Gul Hunter in the Cathedral Ward.
        This fight can be tricky because you first encounter a Yahar'Gul Hunter that uses a Tonitrus near the base of the stairs, and if you advance too far towards the houses, the Rifle Spear Yahar'Gul Hunter will join the fight as well.
        He also uses Ludwig's Rifle, meaning he can hit you from a considerable distance with shotgun pellets no matter what mode he uses for the Rifle Spear.
        
        
    

        Ludwig's Holy Blade
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. It is said that the silver sword was employed by Ludwig, the first hunter of the church. When transformed, it combines with its sheath to form a greatsword. 
        It exhibits several departures from the workshop's design, suggesting that the Church anticipated much larger inhuman beasts."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased for 20,000 echoes from the Messengers after obtaining the Radiant Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon was wielded by Ludwig, a famous hunter of the Healing Church who designed the blade based on the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        According to the description, Ludwig wielded this sword in combat instead of the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        However, in his boss fight, he wields the Holy Moonlight Sword during a certain part in the fight.
        It is possible that Ludwig wielded the Holy Moonlight Sword and his fellow hunters, inspired by the huge weapon, sought to make replicas. Unable to make a magic sword, a huge metal sheath was the compromise.
        Before the DLC's release, Ludwig's Holy Blade was thought of as From Software's traditional "Moonlight Greatsword" seen throughout various games by the fanbase.
        However, this sword was eventually revealed in the DLC to be a replica of the "true" Moonlight Greatsword in Bloodborne, the Holy Moonlight Sword.

        Saw Cleaver
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used in the hunting business. 
        This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts, transforms into a long cleaver that makes use of centrifugal force. 
        The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness the more grotesquely transformed the beast."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired as a gift from the Messengers the first time you visit the Hunter's Dream.
        If you don't select it, you may buy it after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne.)
        
        
        
        The Saw Cleaver is the Trick Weapon featured on the title screen.
        It was also one of the first weapons to be revealed for this game.
        Overall the mechanisms of this weapon didn't change at all, starting all the way back when Bloodborne was still known as "Project Beast."
        According to the concept art, the Saw Cleaver uses a trigger mechanism to unlock the joint during transformation.
        The design of the Saw Cleaver seems to be inspired by multiple references:
        The transformed cleaver shows a resemblance to LB-66 MOONLIGHT from Armored Core V.
        The Japanese name is written as "nokogiri nata" („Éé„Ç≥„ÇÆ„É™Èâà) or "saw hatchet". Nokogiri is a traditional Japanese saw that cuts from the pull stroke, as opposed to the more common push stroke.
        In real life, there is a type of cleaver known as a mezzaluna ("half moon") cleaver, known for chopping/mincing up various food products.
        Most of these types of cleavers have handles on both ends.
        However, some use a single handle that stretches across the blade, which was used to chop up herbs usually; the saw cleaver follows this particular model.
        Coincidentally, the Strength/Skill/Arcane scaling at maximum level is "CDC" in their respective order.
        The CDC is an American organization designed to combat and prevent "health threats" of varying natures.
        Since the beast scourge acts like a plague (and is spread due to blood-related reasons), those who wield the Saw Cleaver can be thought of as fighting a dangerous epidemic.
        Henryk uses this weapon when he fights you and Eileen the Crow during her questline, as well as when he is summoned by you when using the Old Hunter Bell.

        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used by those who dedicate themselves to the hunt. This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts, transforms into a medium-range spear. The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness the more grotesquely transformed the beast."
        
        
        
        Can be bought from the Bath Messengers, after obtaining the Saw Hunter Badge, for 1,000 Blood Echoes.

        Simon's Bowblade
        
        
        Choice weapon of Simon, one of the first Healing Church hunters.
        Simon despised firearms, and so the Church workshop had this specially fashioned to his liking. The large curved blade serves as a bow when transformed.
        But aside from a few close friends, Simon was scoffed at for his choice of arms, for who would dare face the beasts with a measly bow?"
        
        
        
        Fishing Hamlet: Found on the body of Simon the Harrowed next to the Lighthouse Hut lantern after answering the first option at the Hunter's Nightmare shortcut and going through his quest-line. Interact with him as he lies on the ground to obtain the weapon.
        You may also kill Simon the Harrowed at The Hunter's Nightmare or Research Hall to obtain the weapon.
        
        
        
        Simon's Bowblade is the only weapon to have a S-scaling for two attributes (Skill and Bloodtinge respectively) when fully upgraded

        Stake Driver
        
        
        A trick weapon fashioned by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. Favored by the retired hunter Djura. 
        The stake driver, with its queerly complex design, violently drives thick stakes into the flesh of foes. 
        The stake driver allows for high-damage critical attacks, but is difficult to use and leaves its wielder wide open, but none of this should bother a mere Powder Keg."
        
        
        
        Obtain Powder Keg Hunter Badge to unlock for purchase at the Messengers for 8,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Stake Driver is exclusively wielded by Djura when he is still hostile towards you.
        His fight is tricky because the area around him is very limited, meaning you can fall to your death if you're not careful.
        Furthermore, the limited space is perfect for his choice of weapon which has a short range.
        This is modeled after the "Pile Bunker," a type of fictional weaponry which launches piston with gunpowder or explosion.
        In the Japanese version of Bloodborne, this weapon is literally called the Pile Hammer („Éë„Ç§„É´„Éè„É≥„Éû„Éº).
        It bears a striking resemblance to the "Parrying Blade" weapons seen in several "Armored Core" games.
        Has the highest charged attack multiplier out of any other weapon.

        Threaded Cane
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used by hunters on their duties. Sufficiently deadly as a rigid bladed cane, but also serves as a whip when its blade is split into many. Concealing the weapon inside the cane and flogging the beasts with the whip is partly an act of ceremony, an attempt to demonstrate to oneself that the bloodlust of the hunt will never encroach upon the soul."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired at the beginning of the game as a gift from the Messengers.
        If not selected, it is later available for purchase from the blood fountain messengers after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne).
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is used by Iosefka, Last Scholar Yurie and the Frontier Church Hunter.
        Gehrman carries a generic cane in the Workshop instead of the Threaded Cane.
        This trick weapon is possibly inspired by the sword used by Jean-Fran√ßois de Morangias in the climactic battle of French action-horror film Brotherhood of the Wolf (which bears many other similarities to Bloodborne), or the sword used by a bandit leader in the anime/manga series Claymore. Both these weapons act as a straight, double-edged sword that can transform into a segmented, bladed whip.

        Tonitrus
        
        
        "A unique trick weapon contrived by Archibald, the infamous eccentric of the Healing Church workshop. 
        Striking this peculiar iron morning star flail like a match generates the same blue sparks that blanket a darkbeast. 
        Unfortunately, for reasons untold, the hunters of Archibald's time did not fully take to the device."
        
        
        
        Acquire the Spark Hunter Badge by defeating Darkbeast Paarl  to purchase from Messengers.
        Treasure: Yahar'gul, Unseen Village, at the top end of the road. (guarded by 2 Tainted Dogs and a Snatcher during daytime)
        
        
        
        Tonitrus is a Latin word meaning "thunder."
        The in-game description classifies this trick weapon as a morning star flail, but it's actually modeled in the form of a mace.
        The description of Archibald bears many similarities to Nikola Tesla, a famed inventor in real life who specialized in the field of electricity.
        Nikola Tesla created the Tesla Coil, a device that also bears many similarities to the Tonitrus.
        The Tonitrus also bears similarities with the aspergillum, a device used by the Roman Catholic Church to sprinkle holy water.
        According to the description of the Spark Hunter Badge, Archibald was associated with the Healing Church.
        In this sense, it may have been designed under the themes of "purificiation" and "cleansing" that is associated with many Healing Church trick weapons/tools.
        However, due to Archibald's fascination with Dark Beasts, it's more likely he designed the Tonitrus as a measure to replicate the sparks these creatures could unleash.

        The similar nature of these swords suggests that the Healing Church used the method of interchangeable parts to quickly mass produce weapons for their hunters.
        Lore theories exist under Ebrietas Lore.

        Whirligig Saw
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs, and weapon of choice of the Old Hunter Valtr, the Beast Eater. 
        This weapon pummels beasts in its mace form, but its true strength lies in its attached mechanical saws. 
        These discs, lined with serrated teeth,spin rapidly, thrashing the flesh of beasts into fine shreds."
        
        
        
        From the Nightmare Church go down the stairs and follow the path. Drop down into the pools of blood of follow the path further until you reach the Cannon Executioner. Follow the left wall and turn down the path, the weapon is at the end.
        
        
        
        If you use the L2 buzzsaw attack against Orphan of Kos and hold it in place, it attempts to make an immediate counterattack for each time it gets hit by the whirring blades, only to get interrupted by the next hit. It shrieks every time it attacks, so as a result, it lets loose dozens of overlapping shriek sound effects for as long as you hold it in place.
        A whirligig is defined as a toy that is constantly spinning, such as a top or pinwheel, or as something regarded as hectic and constantly changing.
        Similar to most Powder Keg weapons sharing homage to Armored Core weapons, the Whirligig Saw is based on the Grind Blade.
        
    

        Rakuyo
        
        
        Hunter weapon wielded by Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower. 
        A trick sword originated in the same country as the Cainhurst Chikage, only this sword feeds not off blood, but instead demands great dexterity. 
        Lady Maria was fond of this aspect of the Rakuyo, as she frowned upon blood blades, despite being a distant relative of the queen. 
        One day, she abandoned her beloved Rakuyo, casting it into a dark well, when she could stomach it no longer."
        
        
        
        Fishing Hamlet. Get to the bottom of the well. Can be reached from the underground tunnels at the end of the area or via a ladder in the well right away. In that area a Shark Giant will wander around. Fighting him makes a second one appear after the first reaches sufficiently low health. The first giant will walk over near the ladder and scream at the ceiling, causing the second one to drop. The second one drops the weapon.
        Fighting the two of them can be difficult and it is a good idea to use the Shaman Bone Blade to make them fight each other and finish off the weaker one. Molotov cocktails are also very effective against them. If neither is available to you, try to kill the one with the anchor first, as it is significantly harder to dodge.
        One easy way to beat them is use of ranged weapon like Simon's Bowblade if you are a bloodtinge build, and the Holy Moonlight Sword if you are an arcane build.
        A Threaded Cane's transformed whip can easily hit the giants from the ledge once they're lured over and begin attacking, but be sure to keep your distance after each hit. Except that there is no way to lure them over the the ledge. No ranged weapon will hit the one standing at the back and the one hanging from the ceiling doesn't drop down until the first one is at 50% health. 
        Unlike other giants in the game, these ones are easy to gun parry for a visceral attack. Keep in mind this will get very tricky after the other one starts fighting, so try to separate them and time your viscerals to get the invincibility at the right moment.
        If your range is inadequate you can use the monocular to angle a throwing knife to be able to hit the shark giant in the back. This way, you can continue from the strategy of killing them on the ledge with a gun/magic without going around. (confirmed as of January 19th, 2019)
        Chaining together backstabs is a very effecient way of dealing with them, if played right you should be able to eliminate the first shark giant before the second reaches you this way. It is extremely difficult to get behind the patrolling Shark Giant without him detecting you.

        Amygdalan Arm 
        
        
        The arm of a small Amygdala Great One. 
        Strictly speaking, the Amygdalan Arm is no trick weapon of any sort, but certain madmen wield them like clubs. 
        Starts as a large, tough blunt weapon formed of bone, but when extended, the hand quivers as if it were still alive.
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare, cave at the end of the blood river to the right after getting out of the building that used to be the shortcut to the Cleric Beast in the main game. Gatling Gun Hunter dropping the Gatling Gun and a Blood-Starved Beast can be also found here. Arm is near the Blood-Starved Beast at the end of the cave.
        
        
        
        The Amygdalan Arm is a Trick Weapon in name only, considering that it is an arm obtained from Amygdala.
        The arm is remarkably small, as even the Lesser Amygdalae are huge. Perhaps it came from a newborn Amygdala.
        The arm could be the inspiration behind the Burial Blade.

        Beast Claw
        
        
        Beastly weapon wielded by Irreverent Izzy.
        Crafted by chiseling the long bones of an undead darkbeast and fastening them to the weapon. The bones are still alive, and when unleashed, grant its wielder a spurt of beastly power. 
        As flesh is flayed and blood is sprayed, the beast within awakens, and in time, the wielder of this weapon surges with both strength and feverish reverie."
        
        
        
        Ailing Loran Chalice: Layer 2 treasure room. Room is on the right when exiting the elevator from first layer boss fight, before the second layers lantern.
        Can be bought from messengers for 34000 echoes after acquisition.
        Can be bought from messengers after co-operation with player who has them. This only occurs in Hunter's dream before fight with Gehrman or Moon Presence. It is not needed to complete any Chalice Dungeons. It is unknown if this is glitch or intentional. Was patched by 1.07 or 1.08.
        
        
        
        When this weapon is equipped, your gloves will be replaced by two bone gauntlets. This can allow for the lost art of rapid glove changing if you switch your weapons really fast.
        You can charge the beasthood meter on the first windows (Gilbert) of Central Yharnam
        In the past, there was a rare glitch that allowed a player to obtain this weapon without finding it in the Chalice Dungeons.
        It has since been patched, although it isn't quite known when it was successfully patched.

        A trick weapon used by the old hunters. 
        A second blade is found inside the curve of the main one. In its initial form, the saif can be wielded like a long curved sword, but when transformed, its blade is contracted, allowing for quick, repeated stabs. 
        Although this trick weapon allows for adaptive combat, it was later replaced by saws and similar weapons that were more effective at disposing of beasts."

        A trick weapon used by Old Hunters. 
        This thick iron cleaver slices through the toughest of beast hides, and when transformed the blade splits into sections, allowing one to lash it in the fashion of a heavy whip. 
        This crude weapon relies on brute force and is regrettably inelegant, suggesting that the hunts of the earliest hunters made for horrific affairs, painted in sanguine black and reds."
        
        
        
        When walking up the stairs to the nightmare version of the Grand Cathedral, turn left onto a small platform, then roll off and walk down some rough terrain to find the weapon on a corpse.
        
        
        
        Reminds many of the Zanpakut≈ç , a fictional segmented sword that can function as a whip. It is an iconic weapon from the Bleach anime.
        The untransformed form of the weapon is a cleaver-like serrated club, and it really looks like the samoan war club "Nifo Oti".

        Blade of mercy
        
        
        A special trick weapon passed down among hunters of hunters. One of the oldest weapons of the workshop. 
        Splits into two when activated. The weapon's warped blades are forged with siderite, a rare mineral of the heavens. Most effective swift attacks,such as after a quick-stepping."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers for 40000 echoes after obtaining the Crow Hunter Badge from Eileen the Crow's quest line.
        Killing Eileen is also a way to get the weapon early in the game.
        While progressing through Eileen's quest, it's possible for her to be killed by Henryk and thus drop the Crow Hunter Badge as a result, although the quest line will end.
        
        
        
        The Blade of Mercy was originally named as "Warped Twinblades" during the Alpha test, and it was the tool of choice for the "agile" hunter.
        Both the Burial Blade and Blade of Mercy make mentions of a mineral known as siderite in their descriptions.
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite, and it seems to be the reason why arcane power has direct scaling with both blade's damage output. Due to its extraterrestrial origins, that may explain why it cannot be buffed by an external source of any sort.
        It loosely resembles the Eleum Loyce from Dark Souls 2, a sword with two blades at the front.

        Return to the underground prison (from the underground corpse pile lamp, go up the stairs and turn left) and open the door to Brador's cell. His cell is the second on the left behind a flight of downward stairs. Kill Brador to obtain the bloodletter.
        Brador will not be hostile in his cell, but will invade the player right outside his cell.

        Rakuyo
        
        
        Hunter weapon wielded by Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower. 
        A trick sword originated in the same country as the Cainhurst Chikage, only this sword feeds not off blood, but instead demands great dexterity. 
        Lady Maria was fond of this aspect of the Rakuyo, as she frowned upon blood blades, despite being a distant relative of the queen. 
        One day, she abandoned her beloved Rakuyo, casting it into a dark well, when she could stomach it no longer."
        
        
        
        Fishing Hamlet. Get to the bottom of the well. Can be reached from the underground tunnels at the end of the area or via a ladder in the well right away. In that area a Shark Giant will wander around. Fighting him makes a second one appear after the first reaches sufficiently low health. The first giant will walk over near the ladder and scream at the ceiling, causing the second one to drop. The second one drops the weapon.
        Fighting the two of them can be difficult and it is a good idea to use the Shaman Bone Blade to make them fight each other and finish off the weaker one. Molotov cocktails are also very effective against them. If neither is available to you, try to kill the one with the anchor first, as it is significantly harder to dodge.
        One easy way to beat them is use of ranged weapon like Simon's Bowblade if you are a bloodtinge build, and the Holy Moonlight Sword if you are an arcane build.
        A Threaded Cane's transformed whip can easily hit the giants from the ledge once they're lured over and begin attacking, but be sure to keep your distance after each hit. Except that there is no way to lure them over the the ledge. No ranged weapon will hit the one standing at the back and the one hanging from the ceiling doesn't drop down until the first one is at 50% health. 
        Unlike other giants in the game, these ones are easy to gun parry for a visceral attack. Keep in mind this will get very tricky after the other one starts fighting, so try to separate them and time your viscerals to get the invincibility at the right moment.
        If your range is inadequate you can use the monocular to angle a throwing knife to be able to hit the shark giant in the back. This way, you can continue from the strategy of killing them on the ledge with a gun/magic without going around. (confirmed as of January 19th, 2019)
        Chaining together backstabs is a very effecient way of dealing with them, if played right you should be able to eliminate the first shark giant before the second reaches you this way. It is extremely difficult to get behind the patrolling Shark Giant without him detecting you.

        Boom Hammer
        
        
        A trick weapon used by the old hunters, and crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. 
        A giant hammer equipped with a miniature furnace. When ignited and fired, it emits a volley of flame that explodes furiously upon impact. 
        Crush the beasts, then burn them - the brute simplicity of the Boom Hammer was favored by hunters with an acute distaste for beasts."

Be sure to shoot the explosives around the item (or act fast), as the wheelchair huntsman's corpse conceals a delayed molotov set to trigger when you try to grab the Boom Hammer, potential killing you in a huge blast.
        
        
        
        When the Boomhammer is lit, Beast Patient mobs will back away from the player as if they had a torch equipped. (May need to initiate primed attack first)

        Burial Blade
        
        
        Trick weapon wielded by Gehrman, the first hunter." 
        A masterpiece that defined the entire array of weapons crafted at the workshop. Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens. 
        Gehrman surely saw the hunt as a dirge of farewell, wishing only that his prey might rest in peace, never again to awaken to another harrowing nightmare. "
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 60,000 Blood Echoes after defeating Gehrman, the First Hunter and acquiring the Old Hunter Badge from him.
        To make Gehrman fight you, the "Refuse" option must be selected.
        If one accepts his proposal, the game will outright end there and it will be impossible to obtain this weapon in that playthrough (not including the uncanny/lost forms found in the chalice dungeons).
        Normally, the Burial Blade can only be obtained in NG+ and beyond. However, one can bypass this by using Bold Hunter's Mark, or being killed, during The Moon Presence boss battle.
        
        
        
         The Burial Blade was the first trick weapon ever created, and it inspired others to develop new trick weapons, usually on the premise of adapting to different combat scenerios.
        Not all weapons adapt to different combat scenerios (e.g. Tonitrus), but the Burial Blade still inspired an entire series of weapons that could "transform" to satisfy different purposes.
        It was created, and exclusively wielded, by Gehrman.
        A Burial Blade can be found above the workshop table in the Hunter's Dream.
        The weapon's description mentions that "Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens."
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite. Due to its extraterrestrial nature, it could be the reason why it has direct scaling with arcane and cannot be tampered by external sources.
        Both the Burial Blade and the Blade of Mercy mentions the use of it in their descriptions.
        Interestingly enough, these two weapons also resemble the talons of Mergo's Wet Nurse.
        The shape of the scythe highly resembles Rurufon's scythe from Shadow Tower Abyss, an early title created by From Software as well as being recurring weapons in Souls series.
        A strange bug on rare occurrences the cape on the hunter may come off, usually in a boss fight you could notice if you dodge back and do an R1 combo the cape disappears. [Note, I haven't seen this happen in a while, it's possible that it may have been fixed, but I'll need confirmation on this]

        Chikage
        
        
        Foreign-made weapon wielded by the royal guards who protect Annalise, Queen of the Vilebloods at Cainhurst Castle. 
        When the intricate, rippled engraving that spans the Chikage's blade is imbrued with blood, the sword sings in scarlet hues. 
        However, the rite eats away at the wielder's very essence."
        
        
        
        Join the Cainhurst Vilebloods covenant available at Cainhurst Castle, and then purchase from the Messengers for 50,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Chikage isn't actually a katana - it is a katana/european sword hybrid. Its short crossguard resembles the one of an early viking sword, or the one of a xiphos (greek sword). The closest european crossguard shape with  this sword is the one of a Karabela (a polish sabre). In other hand, the  hilt and pommel resemble the ones of a longsword (a bit longer, to get easier katana traditional jutsu swings), while the blade shape and the 2-handed fighting style is very similar to a katana. A possible explanation for the origin of this hybrid is that the katana's design was imported to Cainhurst, where some modifications were made to create a sword similar to that commonly used by their knights.
        The Chikage is an allusion to a particular 'breed' of Katanas in the Souls games. While it is similar to both the Hiltless and Chaos Blade from Demon's Souls and Dark Souls respectively, the Chikage bears a stronger resemblance to the Magic Sword "Makoto" (also from Demon's Souls). The Makoto is the only one the bunch to actually DRAIN the user's HP over time, rather than decrease it with each successful swing.
        Chikage (ÂçÉÊôØ) literally means "Thousands Views", however if you separated the word into Chi Kage (Ë°ÄÂΩ±), it means "Blood Shadow". This could be correlated to the fact that Shadows Of Yharnam wield a similar katana with a slight  crossguard, however without using the bloodtinge.
        The transforming attack has the hunter sheathe the Chikage before unleashing a strike. This is a reference to Iaijutsu, a traditional Japanese sword technique that focuses on quick-drawing. At its finest, Iaijutse allows the warrior to unsheathe and strike at incredible speeds.
        The name seems to be a tribute to Chikage Yamamura (mentioned as a "special thanks" in credits)
        The name may also be a reference to the work "1000 Plateaus" by Giles Deluze and Felix Guattari, a famous philosophical essay about fluidity and functionality, maybe dirrectly tied to the esoteric nature of the weapons function.

        Church Pick
        
        
        One of the old trick weapons of the Healing Church, a hunting weapon formed from one of the giant picks that appear in old beast tales. 
        The Church Pick initially serves as a large sword, but when transformed functions as an extended war pick. In spite of its origins, it is a highly practical weapon."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Dropped by a hunter wearing Yahar'Gul set (presumably, this is the summonable Old Hunter Defector Antal) in one of the cells that you open with the Underground Cell Key from the Research Hall. To make this battle simple, attack him through the door with a strong R2 attack, then leave the room. He will lose sight of you and his AI will return to a standstill behind the door. Rinse and repeat until dead.
        
        
        
        The Church Pick And The Hunter's Axe both have similar appearance. When transformed, both are wielded as a polearm and have the same de-transformation attack. The only difference apart from the Church Pick having a slightly more complicated mechanism is that the Hunter's Axe is a strength-based weapon.
        A few of its attacks in the transformed mode are very similar to that of the Burial Blade.

        Holy Moonlight Sword
        
        
        An arcane sword discovered long ago by Ludwig. 
        When blue moonlight dances around the sword, and it channels the abyssal cosmos, its great blade will hurl a shadowy lightwave. 
        The Holy Moonlight Sword is synonymous with Ludwig, the Holy Blade, but few have ever set eyes on the great blade, and whatever guidance it has to offer, it seems to be of a very private, elusive sort."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Found on the Underground Corpse Pile after the fight against Ludwig, The Holy Blade. Ludwig's head will be lying there and you can:
        Kill the head for the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and talk to the head. When prompted, reply "Yes" and you'll get the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and reply "No", then come back later and Simon the Harrowed will be there and give you the sword.
        NOTE: This weapon is missable. If Lawrence is killed before you obtain it, you will no longer be able to talk to the head or obtain it from Simon.
        
        
        
        It seems to be another reappearance of the Moonlight Greatsword, a recurring item found around FromSoftware's games. Notable examples of such games include the first, second and third Dark Souls games, Demon's Souls, King's Field, Ninja Blade, Enchanted Arms, Armored Core, 3D Dot Game Heroes, and Otogi.

        Hunter Axe
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used on the hunt. Retains the qualities of an axe, but offers a wider palette of attacks by transforming. Boasts a heavy blunt attack, leading to high rally potential. No matter their pasts, beasts are no more than beasts. Some choose this axe to play the part of executioner."
        
        
        
        It's possible to pick this trick weapon as a starting weapon near the beginning of Bloodborne.
        If not chosen, it can instead be purchased from the Messengers after the Hunter has found the Saw Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is wielded by Father Gascoigne.
        However, he has a moveset that is different from the Hunter's version.
        He is also capable of using his unique Hunter Pistol even while his Hunter Axe is transformed, which is impossible for the Hunter to do.
        It's also wielded by the Madara's Twin who drops Madara's Whistle when defeated.
        Another hostile hunter NPC wields this trick weapon in the Nightmare Frontier.
        It's been heavily debated by the fanbase whether the transformed mode is a halberd or poleaxe.
        Both forms utilized axe heads with a spear tip at the end (although some poleaxes used hammer heads instead).
        However, neither weapon was known to have extendable handles, which is a special trademark of the Hunter Axe.
        In either case, it's possible this trick weapon was inspired by both weapons and simply incorporated many different designs.
        While wielded in it's transformed mode if the player had a torch equipped in the off-hand beasts afraid of the fire will still recoil in fear of you as if you were brandishing the torch normally (Tested on Beast Patient)
        
        
    

        Rakuyo
        
        
        Hunter weapon wielded by Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower. 
        A trick sword originated in the same country as the Cainhurst Chikage, only this sword feeds not off blood, but instead demands great dexterity. 
        Lady Maria was fond of this aspect of the Rakuyo, as she frowned upon blood blades, despite being a distant relative of the queen. 
        One day, she abandoned her beloved Rakuyo, casting it into a dark well, when she could stomach it no longer."
        
        
        
        Fishing Hamlet. Get to the bottom of the well. Can be reached from the underground tunnels at the end of the area or via a ladder in the well right away. In that area a Shark Giant will wander around. Fighting him makes a second one appear after the first reaches sufficiently low health. The first giant will walk over near the ladder and scream at the ceiling, causing the second one to drop. The second one drops the weapon.
        Fighting the two of them can be difficult and it is a good idea to use the Shaman Bone Blade to make them fight each other and finish off the weaker one. Molotov cocktails are also very effective against them. If neither is available to you, try to kill the one with the anchor first, as it is significantly harder to dodge.
        One easy way to beat them is use of ranged weapon like Simon's Bowblade if you are a bloodtinge build, and the Holy Moonlight Sword if you are an arcane build.
        A Threaded Cane's transformed whip can easily hit the giants from the ledge once they're lured over and begin attacking, but be sure to keep your distance after each hit. Except that there is no way to lure them over the the ledge.

        Kirkhammer
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. On the one side, an easily handled silver sword. On the other, a giant obtuse stone weapon, characterized by a blunt strike and extreme force of impact. The Church takes a heavy-handed, merciless stance toward the plague of beasts, an irony not lost upon the wielders of this most symbolic weapon."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers after acquiring the Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        A miniature of the Kirkhammer was included as the Pre-Order Bonus for Asian editions of Bloodborne. [See the Bundles page for details]
        A "kirk" is an archaic old english word meaning "church."
        This means the weapon is literately known as the Church Hammer.
        The wording also might be a nod to Nordic culture since the word "Kirk" originated from northern England and Old Norse wording.
        The etched wording on the side of the hammer part has similarities to the Old Norse alphabet.
        However, it also has similarities to the Elder Futhark, one of the oldest forms of the runic alphabet system used by Germanic tribes.
        Similar etchings can be found on gravestones all over Yharnam.
        The sword used for this weapon is very similar to the one used for Ludwig's Holy Blade.
        This suggests that the Healing Church used the method of "interchangeable parts" to efficiently mass produce weapons for their hunters.
        However, the sword used for the Kirkhammer is shorter.
        It's wielded by Alfred, should you choose to be friends with him.
        He uses this weapon as a summon.
        However, he wields the Logarius' Wheel if you find him in Cainhurst Castle under special circumstances.
        When untransformed, with the hammer part on the character's back, some cloth parts (capes etc.) of the armor can either get awkwardly stuck on it or cover it.
        Despite being labeled a 'stone weapon', the etchings, wear, and sound produced when it strikes indicate that the hammer is in fact made of metal.

        Kos Parasite
        
        
        When the carcass of Kos washed up on the coast, its insides were teeming with tiny parasites, unlike any found in humans. 
        This atypical weapon can only be clasped tight and swung, but a Kos Parasite is said to stimulate phantasms inhabiting a lumenwood"
        
        
        
        Dropped by Orphan of Kos
        
        
        
        The Kos Parasite is perhaps the most interestingly unique weapon in Bloodborne in various ways: It is one of two weapons that can reach it's full potential while using a rune (the other being Beast Claw), the weapon itself is not held, it is purely an arcane weapon, it is the only weapon directly dropped by defeating a boss, it has the highest durability of any weapon at 600 respectively, it is the only weapon to have an A-scaling of any weapon without any upgrades and is the only weapon to have an S-scaling by upgrading it twice.

        Logarius's Wheel
        
        
        "Weapon wielded by martyr Logarius' band of executioners. 
        Used to slaughter the Vilebloods in Cainhurst. Bathed in pools of their blood, and forever steeped in their ire. 
        Transform to release the power of the wheel and manifest their lingering rage in a show of utter brilliance."
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 13,000 Blood Echoes after acquiring the Wheel Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        Alfred utilizes the Logarius' Wheel when found in Cainhurst Castle.
        This weapon is yet another reference to Berserk, as they are often made in Miyazaki's previous Souls games.
        "Logarius and his band of executioners" bear many similarities to Mozgus, an insanely devout man who traveled the land torturing heretics along with his disciples.
        The wheel in particular was wielded by one of his six disciples, .
        In Dark Souls, Bonewheel Skeletons are another reference to Mozgus' disciples.
        In real life, although wheels weren't typically wielded as weapons, they were commonly used as torture devices, especially during the Middle Ages.
        Torture wheels were nicknamed "breaking wheels," since victims often times would have their limbs broken during the process.
        They were also known as "catherine wheels."
         It's quite possible that Logarius' Wheel also takes some inspiration in its use as a weapon from the English folklore legend of Tom Hickathrift. Tom was a fabled giant killer who made use of a cartwheel to vanquish the Wisbech Giant (also referred to as an ogre).
        Lore theories can be found under "From Berserk to Bloodborne".

        Ludwig's Holy Blade
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. It is said that the silver sword was employed by Ludwig, the first hunter of the church. When transformed, it combines with its sheath to form a greatsword. 
        It exhibits several departures from the workshop's design, suggesting that the Church anticipated much larger inhuman beasts."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased for 20,000 echoes from the Messengers after obtaining the Radiant Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon was wielded by Ludwig, a famous hunter of the Healing Church who designed the blade based on the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        According to the description, Ludwig wielded this sword in combat instead of the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        However, in his boss fight, he wields the Holy Moonlight Sword during a certain part in the fight.
        It is possible that Ludwig wielded the Holy Moonlight Sword and his fellow hunters, inspired by the huge weapon, sought to make replicas. Unable to make a magic sword, a huge metal sheath was the compromise.
        Before the DLC's release, Ludwig's Holy Blade was thought of as From Software's traditional "Moonlight Greatsword" seen throughout various games by the fanbase.
        However, this sword was eventually revealed in the DLC to be a replica of the "true" Moonlight Greatsword in Bloodborne, the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        This isn't the first time Miyazaki used the name of classical music composers in a game.
        A boss from the first "Dark Souls" game, Dragonslayer Ornstein, is named after Leo Ornstein.
        Berlioz from "Armored Core 4" is named after Hector Berlioz.
        The normal form of this weapon is very similar to the sword used for the Kirkhammer.
        However, this sword's normal form has a slightly longer reach when compared to the Kirkhammer's blade.
        The similar nature of these swords suggests that the Healing Church used the method of interchangeable parts to quickly mass produce weapons for their hunters.
        Lore theories exist under Ebrietas Lore.

        Unlike other giants in the game, these ones are easy to gun parry for a visceral attack. Keep in mind this will get very tricky after the other one starts fighting, so try to separate them and time your viscerals to get the invincibility at the right moment.
        If your range is inadequate you can use the monocular to angle a throwing knife to be able to hit the shark giant in the back. This way, you can continue from the strategy of killing them on the ledge with a gun/magic without going around. (confirmed as of January 19th, 2019)
        Chaining together backstabs is a very effecient way of dealing with them, if played right you should be able to eliminate the first shark giant before the second reaches you this way. It is extremely difficult to get behind the patrolling Shark Giant without him detecting you.

        A trick sword originated in the same country as the Cainhurst Chikage, only this sword feeds not off blood, but instead demands great dexterity. 
        Lady Maria was fond of this aspect of the Rakuyo, as she frowned upon blood blades, despite being a distant relative of the queen.

The first giant will walk over near the ladder and scream at the ceiling, causing the second one to drop. The second one drops the weapon.
        Fighting the two of them can be difficult and it is a good idea to use the Shaman Bone Blade to make them fight each other and finish off the weaker one. Molotov cocktails are also very effective against them. If neither is available to you, try to kill the one with the anchor first, as it is significantly harder to dodge.

        Reiterpallasch
        
        
        Weapon wielded by the Knights of Cainhurst. 
        Combines an elegant knight's sword with the peculiar firearm wielded by the Cainhurst order. 
        The old nobles, long-time imbibers of blood, are no strangers to the sanguine plague, and the disposal of beasts was a discrete task left to their servants, or knights, as they were called for the sake of appearances."
        
        
        
        It's found in a chest located in the entrance hall of Cainhurst Castle, where the Bound Widows are first encountered. When you first enter the room from the main entrance, run towards your two o'clock. The chest will be found in a corner.
        
        
        
        The Reiterpallasch (from German Reiter "horseback rider" and hungarian pallos [Ààp…ílo É] "sword") is a 17th century Hungarian straight sword with a typically double edged blade and guarded hilt that was used by Hungarian noble cavalry and later adapted by most western European armies.
        As pointed out in its description, the rifle spear is made "possibly in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon" (i.e. this one).
        Wynne D. Fanchon from Armored Core: For Answer; another From Software title, pilots a NEXT named Reiterpallasch.
        Relevant lore theories exist under The Mysteries of Cainhurst Garb and Architecture.

        Rifle Spear
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. A prototype weapon serving as a simple firearm and spear, possibly created in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon. Lacks any notable functions, saving that it is the only trick weapon with an attached gun. "
        
        
        
        It can be found inside a hidden building in Old Yharnam. From the area you fight the first NPC Hunter (who wields a saw spear), drop down where the railing is missing in a corner and land on the ledges below. Go into the building and follow the stairs up; eventually you can find it stashed on a corpse tucked away in a hidden nook as you advance.
        Bought from the messengers for 4000 blood echoes after acquiring the Powder Keg Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        According to the Rifle Spear's description, it was designed as an imitation of "a lost Cainhurst weapon".
        That particular weapon may or may not be the Reiterpallasch.
        It should be noted these two weapons are the only two skill/firearm hybrids whose alternate forms utilize guns.
        The third skill/firearm hybrid weapon in this game is Simon's Bowblade, which transforms from a sword into a bow.
        The Rifle Spear is carried by a Yahar'Gul Hunter in the Cathedral Ward.
        This fight can be tricky because you first encounter a Yahar'Gul Hunter that uses a Tonitrus near the base of the stairs, and if you advance too far towards the houses, the Rifle Spear Yahar'Gul Hunter will join the fight as well.
        He also uses Ludwig's Rifle, meaning he can hit you from a considerable distance with shotgun pellets no matter what mode he uses for the Rifle Spear.

        Saw Cleaver
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used in the hunting business. 
        This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts, transforms into a long cleaver that makes use of centrifugal force. 
        The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness the more grotesquely transformed the beast."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired as a gift from the Messengers the first time you visit the Hunter's Dream.
        If you don't select it, you may buy it after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne.)
        
        
        
        The Saw Cleaver is the Trick Weapon featured on the title screen.
        It was also one of the first weapons to be revealed for this game.
        Overall the mechanisms of this weapon didn't change at all, starting all the way back when Bloodborne was still known as "Project Beast."
        According to the concept art, the Saw Cleaver uses a trigger mechanism to unlock the joint during transformation.
        The design of the Saw Cleaver seems to be inspired by multiple references:
        The transformed cleaver shows a resemblance to LB-66 MOONLIGHT from Armored Core V.
        The Japanese name is written as "nokogiri nata" („Éé„Ç≥„ÇÆ„É™Èâà) or "saw hatchet". Nokogiri is a traditional Japanese saw that cuts from the pull stroke, as opposed to the more common push stroke.
        In real life, there is a type of cleaver known as a mezzaluna ("half moon") cleaver, known for chopping/mincing up various food products.
        Most of these types of cleavers have handles on both ends.
        However, some use a single handle that stretches across the blade, which was used to chop up herbs usually; the saw cleaver follows this particular model.
        Coincidentally, the Strength/Skill/Arcane scaling at maximum level is "CDC" in their respective order.
        The CDC is an American organization designed to combat and prevent "health threats" of varying natures.
        Since the beast scourge acts like a plague (and is spread due to blood-related reasons), those who wield the Saw Cleaver can be thought of as fighting a dangerous epidemic.
        Henryk uses this weapon when he fights you and Eileen the Crow during her questline, as well as when he is summoned by you when using the Old Hunter Bell.

        Stake Driver
        
        
        A trick weapon fashioned by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. Favored by the retired hunter Djura. 
        The stake driver, with its queerly complex design, violently drives thick stakes into the flesh of foes. 
        The stake driver allows for high-damage critical attacks, but is difficult to use and leaves its wielder wide open, but none of this should bother a mere Powder Keg."
        
        
        
        Obtain Powder Keg Hunter Badge to unlock for purchase at the Messengers for 8,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Stake Driver is exclusively wielded by Djura when he is still hostile towards you.
        His fight is tricky because the area around him is very limited, meaning you can fall to your death if you're not careful.
        Furthermore, the limited space is perfect for his choice of weapon which has a short range.
        This is modeled after the "Pile Bunker," a type of fictional weaponry which launches piston with gunpowder or explosion.
        In the Japanese version of Bloodborne, this weapon is literally called the Pile Hammer („Éë„Ç§„É´„Éè„É≥„Éû„Éº).
        It bears a striking resemblance to the "Parrying Blade" weapons seen in several "Armored Core" games.
        Has the highest charged attack multiplier out of any other weapon.
        
        
    

        Rakuyo
        
        
        Hunter weapon wielded by Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower. 
        A trick sword originated in the same country as the Cainhurst Chikage, only this sword feeds not off blood, but instead demands great dexterity. 
        Lady Maria was fond of this aspect of the Rakuyo, as she frowned upon blood blades, despite being a distant relative of the queen. 
        One day, she abandoned her beloved Rakuyo, casting it into a dark well, when she could stomach it no longer."
        
        
        
        Fishing Hamlet. Get to the bottom of the well. Can be reached from the underground tunnels at the end of the area or via a ladder in the well right away. In that area a Shark Giant will wander around. Fighting him makes a second one appear after the first reaches sufficiently low health. The first giant will walk over near the ladder and scream at the ceiling, causing the second one to drop. The second one drops the weapon.
        Fighting the two of them can be difficult and it is a good idea to use the Shaman Bone Blade to make them fight each other and finish off the weaker one. Molotov cocktails are also very effective against them. If neither is available to you, try to kill the one with the anchor first, as it is significantly harder to dodge.
        One easy way to beat them is use of ranged weapon like Simon's Bowblade if you are a bloodtinge build, and the Holy Moonlight Sword if you are an arcane build.
        A Threaded Cane's transformed whip can easily hit the giants from the ledge once they're lured over and begin attacking, but be sure to keep your distance after each hit. Except that there is no way to lure them over the the ledge. No ranged weapon will hit the one standing at the back and the one hanging from the ceiling doesn't drop down until the first one is at 50% health. 
        Unlike other giants in the game, these ones are easy to gun parry for a visceral attack. Keep in mind this will get very tricky after the other one starts fighting, so try to separate them and time your viscerals to get the invincibility at the right moment.
        If your range is inadequate you can use the monocular to angle a throwing knife to be able to hit the shark giant in the back. This way, you can continue from the strategy of killing them on the ledge with a gun/magic without going around. (confirmed as of January 19th, 2019)
        Chaining together backstabs is a very effecient way of dealing with them, if played right you should be able to eliminate the first shark giant before the second reaches you this way. It is extremely difficult to get behind the patrolling Shark Giant without him detecting you.

        Threaded Cane
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used by hunters on their duties. Sufficiently deadly as a rigid bladed cane, but also serves as a whip when its blade is split into many. Concealing the weapon inside the cane and flogging the beasts with the whip is partly an act of ceremony, an attempt to demonstrate to oneself that the bloodlust of the hunt will never encroach upon the soul."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired at the beginning of the game as a gift from the Messengers.
        If not selected, it is later available for purchase from the blood fountain messengers after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne).
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is used by Iosefka, Last Scholar Yurie and the Frontier Church Hunter.
        Gehrman carries a generic cane in the Workshop instead of the Threaded Cane.
        This trick weapon is possibly inspired by the sword used by Jean-Fran√ßois de Morangias in the climactic battle of French action-horror film Brotherhood of the Wolf (which bears many other similarities to Bloodborne), or the sword used by a bandit leader in the anime/manga series Claymore. Both these weapons act as a straight, double-edged sword that can transform into a segmented, bladed whip.

        Tonitrus
        
        
        "A unique trick weapon contrived by Archibald, the infamous eccentric of the Healing Church workshop. 
        Striking this peculiar iron morning star flail like a match generates the same blue sparks that blanket a darkbeast. 
        Unfortunately, for reasons untold, the hunters of Archibald's time did not fully take to the device."
        
        
        
        Acquire the Spark Hunter Badge by defeating Darkbeast Paarl  to purchase from Messengers.
        Treasure: Yahar'gul, Unseen Village, at the top end of the road. (guarded by 2 Tainted Dogs and a Snatcher during daytime)
        
        
        
        Tonitrus is a Latin word meaning "thunder."
        The in-game description classifies this trick weapon as a morning star flail, but it's actually modeled in the form of a mace.
        The description of Archibald bears many similarities to Nikola Tesla, a famed inventor in real life who specialized in the field of electricity.
        Nikola Tesla created the Tesla Coil, a device that also bears many similarities to the Tonitrus.
        The Tonitrus also bears similarities with the aspergillum, a device used by the Roman Catholic Church to sprinkle holy water.
        According to the description of the Spark Hunter Badge, Archibald was associated with the Healing Church.
        In this sense, it may have been designed under the themes of "purificiation" and "cleansing" that is associated with many Healing Church trick weapons/tools.
        However, due to Archibald's fascination with Dark Beasts, it's more likely he designed the Tonitrus as a measure to replicate the sparks these creatures could unleash.

        Whirligig Saw
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs, and weapon of choice of the Old Hunter Valtr, the Beast Eater. 
        This weapon pummels beasts in its mace form, but its true strength lies in its attached mechanical saws. 
        These discs, lined with serrated teeth,spin rapidly, thrashing the flesh of beasts into fine shreds."
        
        
        
        From the Nightmare Church go down the stairs and follow the path. Drop down into the pools of blood of follow the path further until you reach the Cannon Executioner. Follow the left wall and turn down the path, the weapon is at the end.
        
        
        
        If you use the L2 buzzsaw attack against Orphan of Kos and hold it in place, it attempts to make an immediate counterattack for each time it gets hit by the whirring blades, only to get interrupted by the next hit. It shrieks every time it attacks, so as a result, it lets loose dozens of overlapping shriek sound effects for as long as you hold it in place.
        A whirligig is defined as a toy that is constantly spinning, such as a top or pinwheel, or as something regarded as hectic and constantly changing.
        Similar to most Powder Keg weapons sharing homage to Armored Core weapons, the Whirligig Saw is based on the Grind Blade.
        
    

        Reiterpallasch
        
        
        Weapon wielded by the Knights of Cainhurst. 
        Combines an elegant knight's sword with the peculiar firearm wielded by the Cainhurst order. 
        The old nobles, long-time imbibers of blood, are no strangers to the sanguine plague, and the disposal of beasts was a discrete task left to their servants, or knights, as they were called for the sake of appearances."
        
        
        
        It's found in a chest located in the entrance hall of Cainhurst Castle, where the Bound Widows are first encountered. When you first enter the room from the main entrance, run towards your two o'clock. The chest will be found in a corner.
        
        
        
        The Reiterpallasch (from German Reiter "horseback rider" and hungarian pallos [Ààp…ílo É] "sword") is a 17th century Hungarian straight sword with a typically double edged blade and guarded hilt that was used by Hungarian noble cavalry and later adapted by most western European armies.
        As pointed out in its description, the rifle spear is made "possibly in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon" (i.e. this one).
        Wynne D. Fanchon from Armored Core: For Answer; another From Software title, pilots a NEXT named Reiterpallasch.

        Amygdalan Arm 
        
        
        The arm of a small Amygdala Great One. 
        Strictly speaking, the Amygdalan Arm is no trick weapon of any sort, but certain madmen wield them like clubs. 
        Starts as a large, tough blunt weapon formed of bone, but when extended, the hand quivers as if it were still alive.
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare, cave at the end of the blood river to the right after getting out of the building that used to be the shortcut to the Cleric Beast in the main game. Gatling Gun Hunter dropping the Gatling Gun and a Blood-Starved Beast can be also found here. Arm is near the Blood-Starved Beast at the end of the cave.
        
        
        
        The Amygdalan Arm is a Trick Weapon in name only, considering that it is an arm obtained from Amygdala.
        The arm is remarkably small, as even the Lesser Amygdalae are huge. Perhaps it came from a newborn Amygdala.
        The arm could be the inspiration behind the Burial Blade.

        Beastly weapon wielded by Irreverent Izzy.
        Crafted by chiseling the long bones of an undead darkbeast and fastening them to the weapon. The bones are still alive, and when unleashed, grant its wielder a spurt of beastly power. 
        As flesh is flayed and blood is sprayed, the beast within awakens, and in time, the wielder of this weapon surges with both strength and feverish reverie."

        Can be bought from messengers for 34000 echoes after acquisition.
        Can be bought from messengers after co-operation with player who has them. This only occurs in Hunter's dream before fight with Gehrman or Moon Presence. It is not needed to complete any Chalice Dungeons. It is unknown if this is glitch or intentional. Was patched by 1.07 or 1.08.
        
        
        
        When this weapon is equipped, your gloves will be replaced by two bone gauntlets. This can allow for the lost art of rapid glove changing if you switch your weapons really fast.
        You can charge the beasthood meter on the first windows (Gilbert) of Central Yharnam
        In the past, there was a rare glitch that allowed a player to obtain this weapon without finding it in the Chalice Dungeons.
        It has since been patched, although it isn't quite known when it was successfully patched.

        A second blade is found inside the curve of the main one. In its initial form, the saif can be wielded like a long curved sword, but when transformed, its blade is contracted, allowing for quick, repeated stabs. 
        Although this trick weapon allows for adaptive combat, it was later replaced by saws and similar weapons that were more effective at disposing of beasts."

        A trick weapon used by Old Hunters. 
        This thick iron cleaver slices through the toughest of beast hides, and when transformed the blade splits into sections, allowing one to lash it in the fashion of a heavy whip. 
        This crude weapon relies on brute force and is regrettably inelegant, suggesting that the hunts of the earliest hunters made for horrific affairs, painted in sanguine black and reds."
        
        
        
        When walking up the stairs to the nightmare version of the Grand Cathedral, turn left onto a small platform, then roll off and walk down some rough terrain to find the weapon on a corpse.
        
        
        
        Reminds many of the Zanpakut≈ç , a fictional segmented sword that can function as a whip. It is an iconic weapon from the Bleach anime.
        The untransformed form of the weapon is a cleaver-like serrated club, and it really looks like the samoan war club "Nifo Oti".

        Blade of mercy
        
        
        A special trick weapon passed down among hunters of hunters. One of the oldest weapons of the workshop. 
        Splits into two when activated. The weapon's warped blades are forged with siderite, a rare mineral of the heavens. Most effective swift attacks,such as after a quick-stepping."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers for 40000 echoes after obtaining the Crow Hunter Badge from Eileen the Crow's quest line.
        Killing Eileen is also a way to get the weapon early in the game.
        While progressing through Eileen's quest, it's possible for her to be killed by Henryk and thus drop the Crow Hunter Badge as a result, although the quest line will end.
        
        
        
        The Blade of Mercy was originally named as "Warped Twinblades" during the Alpha test, and it was the tool of choice for the "agile" hunter.
        Both the Burial Blade and Blade of Mercy make mentions of a mineral known as siderite in their descriptions.
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite, and it seems to be the reason why arcane power has direct scaling with both blade's damage output. Due to its extraterrestrial origins, that may explain why it cannot be buffed by an external source of any sort.
        It loosely resembles the Eleum Loyce from Dark Souls 2, a sword with two blades at the front.

        Bloodletter
        
        
        The demented hunter weapon brandished by Brador, the Healing Church assassin. 
        The Bloodletter assumes its true and terrifying form after it draws upon blood from the inner reaches of one's body and soul. 
        This is the only effective means of expelling tainted blood, or so Brador, isolated in his cell, continued to believe."
        
        
        
        Obtain the underground cell inner chamber key.
        Return to the underground prison (from the underground corpse pile lamp, go up the stairs and turn left) and open the door to Brador's cell. His cell is the second on the left behind a flight of downward stairs. Kill Brador to obtain the bloodletter.
        Brador will not be hostile in his cell, but will invade the player right outside his cell.

        Boom Hammer
        
        
        A trick weapon used by the old hunters, and crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. 
        A giant hammer equipped with a miniature furnace. When ignited and fired, it emits a volley of flame that explodes furiously upon impact. 
        Crush the beasts, then burn them - the brute simplicity of the Boom Hammer was favored by hunters with an acute distaste for beasts."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare. Inside a house that looks out of Central Yharnam, the same that is the shortcut to the cleric beast in the main game, where the 10 quicksilver bullets used to be. Be sure to shoot the explosives around the item (or act fast), as the wheelchair huntsman's corpse conceals a delayed molotov set to trigger when you try to grab the Boom Hammer, potential killing you in a huge blast.
        
        
        
        When the Boomhammer is lit, Beast Patient mobs will back away from the player as if they had a torch equipped. (May need to initiate primed attack first)

        Burial Blade
        
        
        Trick weapon wielded by Gehrman, the first hunter." 
        A masterpiece that defined the entire array of weapons crafted at the workshop. Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens. 
        Gehrman surely saw the hunt as a dirge of farewell, wishing only that his prey might rest in peace, never again to awaken to another harrowing nightmare. "
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 60,000 Blood Echoes after defeating Gehrman, the First Hunter and acquiring the Old Hunter Badge from him.
        To make Gehrman fight you, the "Refuse" option must be selected.
        If one accepts his proposal, the game will outright end there and it will be impossible to obtain this weapon in that playthrough (not including the uncanny/lost forms found in the chalice dungeons).
        Normally, the Burial Blade can only be obtained in NG+ and beyond. However, one can bypass this by using Bold Hunter's Mark, or being killed, during The Moon Presence boss battle.
        
        
        
         The Burial Blade was the first trick weapon ever created, and it inspired others to develop new trick weapons, usually on the premise of adapting to different combat scenerios.
        Not all weapons adapt to different combat scenerios (e.g. Tonitrus), but the Burial Blade still inspired an entire series of weapons that could "transform" to satisfy different purposes.
        It was created, and exclusively wielded, by Gehrman.
        A Burial Blade can be found above the workshop table in the Hunter's Dream.
        The weapon's description mentions that "Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens."
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite. Due to its extraterrestrial nature, it could be the reason why it has direct scaling with arcane and cannot be tampered by external sources.
        Both the Burial Blade and the Blade of Mercy mentions the use of it in their descriptions.
        Interestingly enough, these two weapons also resemble the talons of Mergo's Wet Nurse.
        The shape of the scythe highly resembles Rurufon's scythe from Shadow Tower Abyss, an early title created by From Software as well as being recurring weapons in Souls series.
        A strange bug on rare occurrences the cape on the hunter may come off, usually in a boss fight you could notice if you dodge back and do an R1 combo the cape disappears. [Note, I haven't seen this happen in a while, it's possible that it may have been fixed, but I'll need confirmation on this]

        Chikage
        
        
        Foreign-made weapon wielded by the royal guards who protect Annalise, Queen of the Vilebloods at Cainhurst Castle. 
        When the intricate, rippled engraving that spans the Chikage's blade is imbrued with blood, the sword sings in scarlet hues. 
        However, the rite eats away at the wielder's very essence."
        
        
        
        Join the Cainhurst Vilebloods covenant available at Cainhurst Castle, and then purchase from the Messengers for 50,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Chikage isn't actually a katana - it is a katana/european sword hybrid. Its short crossguard resembles the one of an early viking sword, or the one of a xiphos (greek sword). The closest european crossguard shape with  this sword is the one of a Karabela (a polish sabre). In other hand, the  hilt and pommel resemble the ones of a longsword (a bit longer, to get easier katana traditional jutsu swings), while the blade shape and the 2-handed fighting style is very similar to a katana. A possible explanation for the origin of this hybrid is that the katana's design was imported to Cainhurst, where some modifications were made to create a sword similar to that commonly used by their knights.
        The Chikage is an allusion to a particular 'breed' of Katanas in the Souls games. While it is similar to both the Hiltless and Chaos Blade from Demon's Souls and Dark Souls respectively, the Chikage bears a stronger resemblance to the Magic Sword "Makoto" (also from Demon's Souls). The Makoto is the only one the bunch to actually DRAIN the user's HP over time, rather than decrease it with each successful swing.
        Chikage (ÂçÉÊôØ) literally means "Thousands Views", however if you separated the word into Chi Kage (Ë°ÄÂΩ±), it means "Blood Shadow". This could be correlated to the fact that Shadows Of Yharnam wield a similar katana with a slight  crossguard, however without using the bloodtinge.
        The transforming attack has the hunter sheathe the Chikage before unleashing a strike. This is a reference to Iaijutsu, a traditional Japanese sword technique that focuses on quick-drawing. At its finest, Iaijutse allows the warrior to unsheathe and strike at incredible speeds.
        The name seems to be a tribute to Chikage Yamamura (mentioned as a "special thanks" in credits)
        The name may also be a reference to the work "1000 Plateaus" by Giles Deluze and Felix Guattari, a famous philosophical essay about fluidity and functionality, maybe dirrectly tied to the esoteric nature of the weapons function.

        Church Pick
        
        
        One of the old trick weapons of the Healing Church, a hunting weapon formed from one of the giant picks that appear in old beast tales. 
        The Church Pick initially serves as a large sword, but when transformed functions as an extended war pick. In spite of its origins, it is a highly practical weapon."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Dropped by a hunter wearing Yahar'Gul set (presumably, this is the summonable Old Hunter Defector Antal) in one of the cells that you open with the Underground Cell Key from the Research Hall. To make this battle simple, attack him through the door with a strong R2 attack, then leave the room. He will lose sight of you and his AI will return to a standstill behind the door. Rinse and repeat until dead.
        
        
        
        The Church Pick And The Hunter's Axe both have similar appearance. When transformed, both are wielded as a polearm and have the same de-transformation attack. The only difference apart from the Church Pick having a slightly more complicated mechanism is that the Hunter's Axe is a strength-based weapon.
        A few of its attacks in the transformed mode are very similar to that of the Burial Blade.

        Holy Moonlight Sword
        
        
        An arcane sword discovered long ago by Ludwig. 
        When blue moonlight dances around the sword, and it channels the abyssal cosmos, its great blade will hurl a shadowy lightwave. 
        The Holy Moonlight Sword is synonymous with Ludwig, the Holy Blade, but few have ever set eyes on the great blade, and whatever guidance it has to offer, it seems to be of a very private, elusive sort."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Found on the Underground Corpse Pile after the fight against Ludwig, The Holy Blade. Ludwig's head will be lying there and you can:
        Kill the head for the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and talk to the head. When prompted, reply "Yes" and you'll get the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and reply "No", then come back later and Simon the Harrowed will be there and give you the sword.
        NOTE: This weapon is missable. If Lawrence is killed before you obtain it, you will no longer be able to talk to the head or obtain it from Simon.
        
        
        
        It seems to be another reappearance of the Moonlight Greatsword, a recurring item found around FromSoftware's games. Notable examples of such games include the first, second and third Dark Souls games, Demon's Souls, King's Field, Ninja Blade, Enchanted Arms, Armored Core, 3D Dot Game Heroes, and Otogi.

        Hunter Axe
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used on the hunt. Retains the qualities of an axe, but offers a wider palette of attacks by transforming. Boasts a heavy blunt attack, leading to high rally potential. No matter their pasts, beasts are no more than beasts. Some choose this axe to play the part of executioner."
        
        
        
        It's possible to pick this trick weapon as a starting weapon near the beginning of Bloodborne.
        If not chosen, it can instead be purchased from the Messengers after the Hunter has found the Saw Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is wielded by Father Gascoigne.
        However, he has a moveset that is different from the Hunter's version.
        He is also capable of using his unique Hunter Pistol even while his Hunter Axe is transformed, which is impossible for the Hunter to do.
        It's also wielded by the Madara's Twin who drops Madara's Whistle when defeated.
        Another hostile hunter NPC wields this trick weapon in the Nightmare Frontier.
        It's been heavily debated by the fanbase whether the transformed mode is a halberd or poleaxe.
        Both forms utilized axe heads with a spear tip at the end (although some poleaxes used hammer heads instead).
        However, neither weapon was known to have extendable handles, which is a special trademark of the Hunter Axe.
        In either case, it's possible this trick weapon was inspired by both weapons and simply incorporated many different designs.
        While wielded in it's transformed mode if the player had a torch equipped in the off-hand beasts afraid of the fire will still recoil in fear of you as if you were brandishing the torch normally (Tested on Beast Patient)

        Kirkhammer
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. On the one side, an easily handled silver sword. On the other, a giant obtuse stone weapon, characterized by a blunt strike and extreme force of impact. The Church takes a heavy-handed, merciless stance toward the plague of beasts, an irony not lost upon the wielders of this most symbolic weapon."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers after acquiring the Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        A miniature of the Kirkhammer was included as the Pre-Order Bonus for Asian editions of Bloodborne. [See the Bundles page for details]
        A "kirk" is an archaic old english word meaning "church."
        This means the weapon is literately known as the Church Hammer.
        The wording also might be a nod to Nordic culture since the word "Kirk" originated from northern England and Old Norse wording.
        The etched wording on the side of the hammer part has similarities to the Old Norse alphabet.
        However, it also has similarities to the Elder Futhark, one of the oldest forms of the runic alphabet system used by Germanic tribes.
        Similar etchings can be found on gravestones all over Yharnam.
        The sword used for this weapon is very similar to the one used for Ludwig's Holy Blade.
        This suggests that the Healing Church used the method of "interchangeable parts" to efficiently mass produce weapons for their hunters.
        However, the sword used for the Kirkhammer is shorter.
        It's wielded by Alfred, should you choose to be friends with him.
        He uses this weapon as a summon.
        However, he wields the Logarius' Wheel if you find him in Cainhurst Castle under special circumstances.
        When untransformed, with the hammer part on the character's back, some cloth parts (capes etc.) of the armor can either get awkwardly stuck on it or cover it.
        Despite being labeled a 'stone weapon', the etchings, wear, and sound produced when it strikes indicate that the hammer is in fact made of metal.

        The old nobles, long-time imbibers of blood, are no strangers to the sanguine plague, and the disposal of beasts was a discrete task left to their servants, or knights, as they were called for the sake of appearances."

        Kos Parasite
        
        
        When the carcass of Kos washed up on the coast, its insides were teeming with tiny parasites, unlike any found in humans. 
        This atypical weapon can only be clasped tight and swung, but a Kos Parasite is said to stimulate phantasms inhabiting a lumenwood"
        
        
        
        Dropped by Orphan of Kos
        
        
        
        The Kos Parasite is perhaps the most interestingly unique weapon in Bloodborne in various ways: It is one of two weapons that can reach it's full potential while using a rune (the other being Beast Claw), the weapon itself is not held, it is purely an arcane weapon, it is the only weapon directly dropped by defeating a boss, it has the highest durability of any weapon at 600 respectively, it is the only weapon to have an A-scaling of any weapon without any upgrades and is the only weapon to have an S-scaling by upgrading it twice.

        Logarius's Wheel
        
        
        "Weapon wielded by martyr Logarius' band of executioners. 
        Used to slaughter the Vilebloods in Cainhurst. Bathed in pools of their blood, and forever steeped in their ire. 
        Transform to release the power of the wheel and manifest their lingering rage in a show of utter brilliance."
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 13,000 Blood Echoes after acquiring the Wheel Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        Alfred utilizes the Logarius' Wheel when found in Cainhurst Castle.
        This weapon is yet another reference to Berserk, as they are often made in Miyazaki's previous Souls games.
        "Logarius and his band of executioners" bear many similarities to Mozgus, an insanely devout man who traveled the land torturing heretics along with his disciples.
        The wheel in particular was wielded by one of his six disciples, .
        In Dark Souls, Bonewheel Skeletons are another reference to Mozgus' disciples.
        In real life, although wheels weren't typically wielded as weapons, they were commonly used as torture devices, especially during the Middle Ages.
        Torture wheels were nicknamed "breaking wheels," since victims often times would have their limbs broken during the process.
        They were also known as "catherine wheels."
         It's quite possible that Logarius' Wheel also takes some inspiration in its use as a weapon from the English folklore legend of Tom Hickathrift. Tom was a fabled giant killer who made use of a cartwheel to vanquish the Wisbech Giant (also referred to as an ogre).

        Ludwig's Holy Blade
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. It is said that the silver sword was employed by Ludwig, the first hunter of the church. When transformed, it combines with its sheath to form a greatsword. 
        It exhibits several departures from the workshop's design, suggesting that the Church anticipated much larger inhuman beasts."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased for 20,000 echoes from the Messengers after obtaining the Radiant Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon was wielded by Ludwig, a famous hunter of the Healing Church who designed the blade based on the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        According to the description, Ludwig wielded this sword in combat instead of the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        However, in his boss fight, he wields the Holy Moonlight Sword during a certain part in the fight.
        It is possible that Ludwig wielded the Holy Moonlight Sword and his fellow hunters, inspired by the huge weapon, sought to make replicas. Unable to make a magic sword, a huge metal sheath was the compromise.
        Before the DLC's release, Ludwig's Holy Blade was thought of as From Software's traditional "Moonlight Greatsword" seen throughout various games by the fanbase.
        However, this sword was eventually revealed in the DLC to be a replica of the "true" Moonlight Greatsword in Bloodborne, the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        This isn't the first time Miyazaki used the name of classical music composers in a game.
        A boss from the first "Dark Souls" game, Dragonslayer Ornstein, is named after Leo Ornstein.
        Berlioz from "Armored Core 4" is named after Hector Berlioz.
        The normal form of this weapon is very similar to the sword used for the Kirkhammer.
        However, this sword's normal form has a slightly longer reach when compared to the Kirkhammer's blade.
        The similar nature of these swords suggests that the Healing Church used the method of interchangeable parts to quickly mass produce weapons for their hunters.

        Rakuyo
        
        
        Hunter weapon wielded by Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower. 
        A trick sword originated in the same country as the Cainhurst Chikage, only this sword feeds not off blood, but instead demands great dexterity. 
        Lady Maria was fond of this aspect of the Rakuyo, as she frowned upon blood blades, despite being a distant relative of the queen. 
        One day, she abandoned her beloved Rakuyo, casting it into a dark well, when she could stomach it no longer."
        
        
        
        Fishing Hamlet. Get to the bottom of the well. Can be reached from the underground tunnels at the end of the area or via a ladder in the well right away. In that area a Shark Giant will wander around. Fighting him makes a second one appear after the first reaches sufficiently low health. The first giant will walk over near the ladder and scream at the ceiling, causing the second one to drop. The second one drops the weapon.
        Fighting the two of them can be difficult and it is a good idea to use the Shaman Bone Blade to make them fight each other and finish off the weaker one. Molotov cocktails are also very effective against them. If neither is available to you, try to kill the one with the anchor first, as it is significantly harder to dodge.
        One easy way to beat them is use of ranged weapon like Simon's Bowblade if you are a bloodtinge build, and the Holy Moonlight Sword if you are an arcane build.
        A Threaded Cane's transformed whip can easily hit the giants from the ledge once they're lured over and begin attacking, but be sure to keep your distance after each hit. Except that there is no way to lure them over the the ledge. No ranged weapon will hit the one standing at the back and the one hanging from the ceiling doesn't drop down until the first one is at 50% health. 
        Unlike other giants in the game, these ones are easy to gun parry for a visceral attack. Keep in mind this will get very tricky after the other one starts fighting, so try to separate them and time your viscerals to get the invincibility at the right moment.
        If your range is inadequate you can use the monocular to angle a throwing knife to be able to hit the shark giant in the back. This way, you can continue from the strategy of killing them on the ledge with a gun/magic without going around. (confirmed as of January 19th, 2019)
        Chaining together backstabs is a very effecient way of dealing with them, if played right you should be able to eliminate the first shark giant before the second reaches you this way. It is extremely difficult to get behind the patrolling Shark Giant without him detecting you. 
        For a video showing an easy way to kill the sharks with a monocular and a throwing knife strategy, check .
        
        
        
        Rakuyo (ËêΩËëâ) literally means "falling leaf".
        The sword of Rakuyo bears resemblance to the "ky≈´ gunt≈ç", which was a hybrid of the sabre/katana with a handguard, used during the Russo-Japanese War.

        Rifle Spear
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. A prototype weapon serving as a simple firearm and spear, possibly created in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon. Lacks any notable functions, saving that it is the only trick weapon with an attached gun. "
        
        
        
        It can be found inside a hidden building in Old Yharnam. From the area you fight the first NPC Hunter (who wields a saw spear), drop down where the railing is missing in a corner and land on the ledges below. Go into the building and follow the stairs up; eventually you can find it stashed on a corpse tucked away in a hidden nook as you advance.
        Bought from the messengers for 4000 blood echoes after acquiring the Powder Keg Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        According to the Rifle Spear's description, it was designed as an imitation of "a lost Cainhurst weapon".
        That particular weapon may or may not be the Reiterpallasch.
        It should be noted these two weapons are the only two skill/firearm hybrids whose alternate forms utilize guns.
        The third skill/firearm hybrid weapon in this game is Simon's Bowblade, which transforms from a sword into a bow.
        The Rifle Spear is carried by a Yahar'Gul Hunter in the Cathedral Ward.
        This fight can be tricky because you first encounter a Yahar'Gul Hunter that uses a Tonitrus near the base of the stairs, and if you advance too far towards the houses, the Rifle Spear Yahar'Gul Hunter will join the fight as well.
        He also uses Ludwig's Rifle, meaning he can hit you from a considerable distance with shotgun pellets no matter what mode he uses for the Rifle Spear.

        Saw Cleaver
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used in the hunting business. 
        This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts, transforms into a long cleaver that makes use of centrifugal force. 
        The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness the more grotesquely transformed the beast."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired as a gift from the Messengers the first time you visit the Hunter's Dream.
        If you don't select it, you may buy it after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne.)
        
        
        
        The Saw Cleaver is the Trick Weapon featured on the title screen.
        It was also one of the first weapons to be revealed for this game.
        Overall the mechanisms of this weapon didn't change at all, starting all the way back when Bloodborne was still known as "Project Beast."
        According to the concept art, the Saw Cleaver uses a trigger mechanism to unlock the joint during transformation.
        The design of the Saw Cleaver seems to be inspired by multiple references:
        The transformed cleaver shows a resemblance to LB-66 MOONLIGHT from Armored Core V.
        The Japanese name is written as "nokogiri nata" („Éé„Ç≥„ÇÆ„É™Èâà) or "saw hatchet". Nokogiri is a traditional Japanese saw that cuts from the pull stroke, as opposed to the more common push stroke.
        In real life, there is a type of cleaver known as a mezzaluna ("half moon") cleaver, known for chopping/mincing up various food products.
        Most of these types of cleavers have handles on both ends.
        However, some use a single handle that stretches across the blade, which was used to chop up herbs usually; the saw cleaver follows this particular model.
        Coincidentally, the Strength/Skill/Arcane scaling at maximum level is "CDC" in their respective order.
        The CDC is an American organization designed to combat and prevent "health threats" of varying natures.
        Since the beast scourge acts like a plague (and is spread due to blood-related reasons), those who wield the Saw Cleaver can be thought of as fighting a dangerous epidemic.
        Henryk uses this weapon when he fights you and Eileen the Crow during her questline, as well as when he is summoned by you when using the Old Hunter Bell.
        
        
    

        Reiterpallasch
        
        
        Weapon wielded by the Knights of Cainhurst. 
        Combines an elegant knight's sword with the peculiar firearm wielded by the Cainhurst order. 
        The old nobles, long-time imbibers of blood, are no strangers to the sanguine plague, and the disposal of beasts was a discrete task left to their servants, or knights, as they were called for the sake of appearances."
        
        
        
        It's found in a chest located in the entrance hall of Cainhurst Castle, where the Bound Widows are first encountered. When you first enter the room from the main entrance, run towards your two o'clock. The chest will be found in a corner.
        
        
        
        The Reiterpallasch (from German Reiter "horseback rider" and hungarian pallos [Ààp…ílo É] "sword") is a 17th century Hungarian straight sword with a typically double edged blade and guarded hilt that was used by Hungarian noble cavalry and later adapted by most western European armies.
        As pointed out in its description, the rifle spear is made "possibly in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon" (i.e. this one).

        Saw Spear
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used by those who dedicate themselves to the hunt. This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts, transforms into a medium-range spear. The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness the more grotesquely transformed the beast."
        
        
        
        Can be bought from the Bath Messengers, after obtaining the Saw Hunter Badge, for 1,000 Blood Echoes.
        Treasure in Central Yharnam Sewer, on the ledge above the dead end with boats. You also need to cut down the corpse hanging from the rafters high above.
        
        
        
        Carried by Djura's Ally in Old Yharnam.

        Simon's Bowblade
        
        
        Choice weapon of Simon, one of the first Healing Church hunters.
        Simon despised firearms, and so the Church workshop had this specially fashioned to his liking. The large curved blade serves as a bow when transformed.
        But aside from a few close friends, Simon was scoffed at for his choice of arms, for who would dare face the beasts with a measly bow?"
        
        
        
        Fishing Hamlet: Found on the body of Simon the Harrowed next to the Lighthouse Hut lantern after answering the first option at the Hunter's Nightmare shortcut and going through his quest-line. Interact with him as he lies on the ground to obtain the weapon.
        You may also kill Simon the Harrowed at The Hunter's Nightmare or Research Hall to obtain the weapon.
        
        
        
        Simon's Bowblade is the only weapon to have a S-scaling for two attributes (Skill and Bloodtinge respectively) when fully upgraded

        Stake Driver
        
        
        A trick weapon fashioned by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. Favored by the retired hunter Djura. 
        The stake driver, with its queerly complex design, violently drives thick stakes into the flesh of foes. 
        The stake driver allows for high-damage critical attacks, but is difficult to use and leaves its wielder wide open, but none of this should bother a mere Powder Keg."
        
        
        
        Obtain Powder Keg Hunter Badge to unlock for purchase at the Messengers for 8,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Stake Driver is exclusively wielded by Djura when he is still hostile towards you.
        His fight is tricky because the area around him is very limited, meaning you can fall to your death if you're not careful.
        Furthermore, the limited space is perfect for his choice of weapon which has a short range.
        This is modeled after the "Pile Bunker," a type of fictional weaponry which launches piston with gunpowder or explosion.
        In the Japanese version of Bloodborne, this weapon is literally called the Pile Hammer („Éë„Ç§„É´„Éè„É≥„Éû„Éº).
        It bears a striking resemblance to the "Parrying Blade" weapons seen in several "Armored Core" games.
        Has the highest charged attack multiplier out of any other weapon.

        Threaded Cane
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used by hunters on their duties. Sufficiently deadly as a rigid bladed cane, but also serves as a whip when its blade is split into many. Concealing the weapon inside the cane and flogging the beasts with the whip is partly an act of ceremony, an attempt to demonstrate to oneself that the bloodlust of the hunt will never encroach upon the soul."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired at the beginning of the game as a gift from the Messengers.
        If not selected, it is later available for purchase from the blood fountain messengers after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne).
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is used by Iosefka, Last Scholar Yurie and the Frontier Church Hunter.
        Gehrman carries a generic cane in the Workshop instead of the Threaded Cane.
        This trick weapon is possibly inspired by the sword used by Jean-Fran√ßois de Morangias in the climactic battle of French action-horror film Brotherhood of the Wolf (which bears many other similarities to Bloodborne), or the sword used by a bandit leader in the anime/manga series Claymore. Both these weapons act as a straight, double-edged sword that can transform into a segmented, bladed whip.

        Tonitrus
        
        
        "A unique trick weapon contrived by Archibald, the infamous eccentric of the Healing Church workshop. 
        Striking this peculiar iron morning star flail like a match generates the same blue sparks that blanket a darkbeast. 
        Unfortunately, for reasons untold, the hunters of Archibald's time did not fully take to the device."
        
        
        
        Acquire the Spark Hunter Badge by defeating Darkbeast Paarl  to purchase from Messengers.
        Treasure: Yahar'gul, Unseen Village, at the top end of the road. (guarded by 2 Tainted Dogs and a Snatcher during daytime)
        
        
        
        Tonitrus is a Latin word meaning "thunder."
        The in-game description classifies this trick weapon as a morning star flail, but it's actually modeled in the form of a mace.
        The description of Archibald bears many similarities to Nikola Tesla, a famed inventor in real life who specialized in the field of electricity.
        Nikola Tesla created the Tesla Coil, a device that also bears many similarities to the Tonitrus.
        The Tonitrus also bears similarities with the aspergillum, a device used by the Roman Catholic Church to sprinkle holy water.
        According to the description of the Spark Hunter Badge, Archibald was associated with the Healing Church.
        In this sense, it may have been designed under the themes of "purificiation" and "cleansing" that is associated with many Healing Church trick weapons/tools.
        However, due to Archibald's fascination with Dark Beasts, it's more likely he designed the Tonitrus as a measure to replicate the sparks these creatures could unleash.

        Whirligig Saw
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs, and weapon of choice of the Old Hunter Valtr, the Beast Eater. 
        This weapon pummels beasts in its mace form, but its true strength lies in its attached mechanical saws. 
        These discs, lined with serrated teeth,spin rapidly, thrashing the flesh of beasts into fine shreds."
        
        
        
        From the Nightmare Church go down the stairs and follow the path. Drop down into the pools of blood of follow the path further until you reach the Cannon Executioner. Follow the left wall and turn down the path, the weapon is at the end.
        
        
        
        If you use the L2 buzzsaw attack against Orphan of Kos and hold it in place, it attempts to make an immediate counterattack for each time it gets hit by the whirring blades, only to get interrupted by the next hit. It shrieks every time it attacks, so as a result, it lets loose dozens of overlapping shriek sound effects for as long as you hold it in place.
        A whirligig is defined as a toy that is constantly spinning, such as a top or pinwheel, or as something regarded as hectic and constantly changing.
        Similar to most Powder Keg weapons sharing homage to Armored Core weapons, the Whirligig Saw is based on the Grind Blade.

Lacks any notable functions, saving that it is the only trick weapon with an attached gun. "
        
        
        
        It can be found inside a hidden building in Old Yharnam. From the area you fight the first NPC Hunter (who wields a saw spear), drop down where the railing is missing in a corner and land on the ledges below. Go into the building and follow the stairs up; eventually you can find it stashed on a corpse tucked away in a hidden nook as you advance.
        Bought from the messengers for 4000 blood echoes after acquiring the Powder Keg Hunter Badge.

        This fight can be tricky because you first encounter a Yahar'Gul Hunter that uses a Tonitrus near the base of the stairs, and if you advance too far towards the houses, the Rifle Spear Yahar'Gul Hunter will join the fight as well.

        Amygdalan Arm 
        
        
        The arm of a small Amygdala Great One. 
        Strictly speaking, the Amygdalan Arm is no trick weapon of any sort, but certain madmen wield them like clubs. 
        Starts as a large, tough blunt weapon formed of bone, but when extended, the hand quivers as if it were still alive.

        The Amygdalan Arm is a Trick Weapon in name only, considering that it is an arm obtained from Amygdala.
        The arm is remarkably small, as even the Lesser Amygdalae are huge. Perhaps it came from a newborn Amygdala.
        The arm could be the inspiration behind the Burial Blade.

        Crafted by chiseling the long bones of an undead darkbeast and fastening them to the weapon. The bones are still alive, and when unleashed, grant its wielder a spurt of beastly power.

        Can be bought from messengers for 34000 echoes after acquisition.
        Can be bought from messengers after co-operation with player who has them. This only occurs in Hunter's dream before fight with Gehrman or Moon Presence. It is not needed to complete any Chalice Dungeons. It is unknown if this is glitch or intentional. Was patched by 1.07 or 1.08.
        
        
        
        When this weapon is equipped, your gloves will be replaced by two bone gauntlets. This can allow for the lost art of rapid glove changing if you switch your weapons really fast.
        You can charge the beasthood meter on the first windows (Gilbert) of Central Yharnam
        In the past, there was a rare glitch that allowed a player to obtain this weapon without finding it in the Chalice Dungeons.

        Beasthunter Saif
        
        
        A trick weapon used by the old hunters. 
        A second blade is found inside the curve of the main one. In its initial form, the saif can be wielded like a long curved sword, but when transformed, its blade is contracted, allowing for quick, repeated stabs. 
        Although this trick weapon allows for adaptive combat, it was later replaced by saws and similar weapons that were more effective at disposing of beasts."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare. After the Blood River, when you pass through the cave with a tick, where you encounter two dogs and a large amount of crows along with an enemy Beast Cutter hunter. Climb the ladder on the left of the pit and instead of going forward, turn to the left and drop down the ledge. There will be a single piece of loot guarded by a Saif Hunter.
        
        
        
        The word "saif" is Arabic for "sword."
        
        
    

        Rifle Spear
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. A prototype weapon serving as a simple firearm and spear, possibly created in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon. Lacks any notable functions, saving that it is the only trick weapon with an attached gun. "
        
        
        
        It can be found inside a hidden building in Old Yharnam. From the area you fight the first NPC Hunter (who wields a saw spear), drop down where the railing is missing in a corner and land on the ledges below. Go into the building and follow the stairs up; eventually you can find it stashed on a corpse tucked away in a hidden nook as you advance.
        Bought from the messengers for 4000 blood echoes after acquiring the Powder Keg Hunter Badge.

        It should be noted these two weapons are the only two skill/firearm hybrids whose alternate forms utilize guns.
        The third skill/firearm hybrid weapon in this game is Simon's Bowblade, which transforms from a sword into a bow.
        The Rifle Spear is carried by a Yahar'Gul Hunter in the Cathedral Ward.
        This fight can be tricky because you first encounter a Yahar'Gul Hunter that uses a Tonitrus near the base of the stairs, and if you advance too far towards the houses, the Rifle Spear Yahar'Gul Hunter will join the fight as well.

        Beast Cutter
        
        
        A trick weapon used by Old Hunters. 
        This thick iron cleaver slices through the toughest of beast hides, and when transformed the blade splits into sections, allowing one to lash it in the fashion of a heavy whip. 
        This crude weapon relies on brute force and is regrettably inelegant, suggesting that the hunts of the earliest hunters made for horrific affairs, painted in sanguine black and reds."
        
        
        
        When walking up the stairs to the nightmare version of the Grand Cathedral, turn left onto a small platform, then roll off and walk down some rough terrain to find the weapon on a corpse.
        
        
        
        Reminds many of the Zanpakut≈ç , a fictional segmented sword that can function as a whip. It is an iconic weapon from the Bleach anime.
        The untransformed form of the weapon is a cleaver-like serrated club, and it really looks like the samoan war club "Nifo Oti".

        Blade of mercy
        
        
        A special trick weapon passed down among hunters of hunters. One of the oldest weapons of the workshop. 
        Splits into two when activated. The weapon's warped blades are forged with siderite, a rare mineral of the heavens. Most effective swift attacks,such as after a quick-stepping."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers for 40000 echoes after obtaining the Crow Hunter Badge from Eileen the Crow's quest line.
        Killing Eileen is also a way to get the weapon early in the game.
        While progressing through Eileen's quest, it's possible for her to be killed by Henryk and thus drop the Crow Hunter Badge as a result, although the quest line will end.
        
        
        
        The Blade of Mercy was originally named as "Warped Twinblades" during the Alpha test, and it was the tool of choice for the "agile" hunter.
        Both the Burial Blade and Blade of Mercy make mentions of a mineral known as siderite in their descriptions.
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite, and it seems to be the reason why arcane power has direct scaling with both blade's damage output. Due to its extraterrestrial origins, that may explain why it cannot be buffed by an external source of any sort.
        It loosely resembles the Eleum Loyce from Dark Souls 2, a sword with two blades at the front.

        The demented hunter weapon brandished by Brador, the Healing Church assassin. 
        The Bloodletter assumes its true and terrifying form after it draws upon blood from the inner reaches of one's body and soul. 
        This is the only effective means of expelling tainted blood, or so Brador, isolated in his cell, continued to believe."
        
        
        
        Obtain the underground cell inner chamber key.
        Return to the underground prison (from the underground corpse pile lamp, go up the stairs and turn left) and open the door to Brador's cell. His cell is the second on the left behind a flight of downward stairs. Kill Brador to obtain the bloodletter.
        Brador will not be hostile in his cell, but will invade the player right outside his cell.

        A giant hammer equipped with a miniature furnace. When ignited and fired, it emits a volley of flame that explodes furiously upon impact. 
        Crush the beasts, then burn them - the brute simplicity of the Boom Hammer was favored by hunters with an acute distaste for beasts."

        Burial Blade
        
        
        Trick weapon wielded by Gehrman, the first hunter." 
        A masterpiece that defined the entire array of weapons crafted at the workshop. Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens. 
        Gehrman surely saw the hunt as a dirge of farewell, wishing only that his prey might rest in peace, never again to awaken to another harrowing nightmare. "
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 60,000 Blood Echoes after defeating Gehrman, the First Hunter and acquiring the Old Hunter Badge from him.
        To make Gehrman fight you, the "Refuse" option must be selected.
        If one accepts his proposal, the game will outright end there and it will be impossible to obtain this weapon in that playthrough (not including the uncanny/lost forms found in the chalice dungeons).
        Normally, the Burial Blade can only be obtained in NG+ and beyond. However, one can bypass this by using Bold Hunter's Mark, or being killed, during The Moon Presence boss battle.
        
        
        
         The Burial Blade was the first trick weapon ever created, and it inspired others to develop new trick weapons, usually on the premise of adapting to different combat scenerios.
        Not all weapons adapt to different combat scenerios (e.g. Tonitrus), but the Burial Blade still inspired an entire series of weapons that could "transform" to satisfy different purposes.
        It was created, and exclusively wielded, by Gehrman.
        A Burial Blade can be found above the workshop table in the Hunter's Dream.
        The weapon's description mentions that "Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens."
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite. Due to its extraterrestrial nature, it could be the reason why it has direct scaling with arcane and cannot be tampered by external sources.
        Both the Burial Blade and the Blade of Mercy mentions the use of it in their descriptions.
        Interestingly enough, these two weapons also resemble the talons of Mergo's Wet Nurse.
        The shape of the scythe highly resembles Rurufon's scythe from Shadow Tower Abyss, an early title created by From Software as well as being recurring weapons in Souls series.
        A strange bug on rare occurrences the cape on the hunter may come off, usually in a boss fight you could notice if you dodge back and do an R1 combo the cape disappears. [Note, I haven't seen this happen in a while, it's possible that it may have been fixed, but I'll need confirmation on this]

        Chikage
        
        
        Foreign-made weapon wielded by the royal guards who protect Annalise, Queen of the Vilebloods at Cainhurst Castle. 
        When the intricate, rippled engraving that spans the Chikage's blade is imbrued with blood, the sword sings in scarlet hues. 
        However, the rite eats away at the wielder's very essence."
        
        
        
        Join the Cainhurst Vilebloods covenant available at Cainhurst Castle, and then purchase from the Messengers for 50,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Chikage isn't actually a katana - it is a katana/european sword hybrid. Its short crossguard resembles the one of an early viking sword, or the one of a xiphos (greek sword). The closest european crossguard shape with  this sword is the one of a Karabela (a polish sabre). In other hand, the  hilt and pommel resemble the ones of a longsword (a bit longer, to get easier katana traditional jutsu swings), while the blade shape and the 2-handed fighting style is very similar to a katana. A possible explanation for the origin of this hybrid is that the katana's design was imported to Cainhurst, where some modifications were made to create a sword similar to that commonly used by their knights.
        The Chikage is an allusion to a particular 'breed' of Katanas in the Souls games. While it is similar to both the Hiltless and Chaos Blade from Demon's Souls and Dark Souls respectively, the Chikage bears a stronger resemblance to the Magic Sword "Makoto" (also from Demon's Souls). The Makoto is the only one the bunch to actually DRAIN the user's HP over time, rather than decrease it with each successful swing.
        Chikage (ÂçÉÊôØ) literally means "Thousands Views", however if you separated the word into Chi Kage (Ë°ÄÂΩ±), it means "Blood Shadow". This could be correlated to the fact that Shadows Of Yharnam wield a similar katana with a slight  crossguard, however without using the bloodtinge.
        The transforming attack has the hunter sheathe the Chikage before unleashing a strike. This is a reference to Iaijutsu, a traditional Japanese sword technique that focuses on quick-drawing. At its finest, Iaijutse allows the warrior to unsheathe and strike at incredible speeds.
        The name seems to be a tribute to Chikage Yamamura (mentioned as a "special thanks" in credits)
        The name may also be a reference to the work "1000 Plateaus" by Giles Deluze and Felix Guattari, a famous philosophical essay about fluidity and functionality, maybe dirrectly tied to the esoteric nature of the weapons function.

        One of the old trick weapons of the Healing Church, a hunting weapon formed from one of the giant picks that appear in old beast tales. 
        The Church Pick initially serves as a large sword, but when transformed functions as an extended war pick. In spite of its origins, it is a highly practical weapon."

To make this battle simple, attack him through the door with a strong R2 attack, then leave the room. He will lose sight of you and his AI will return to a standstill behind the door. Rinse and repeat until dead.
        
        
        
        The Church Pick And The Hunter's Axe both have similar appearance. When transformed, both are wielded as a polearm and have the same de-transformation attack. The only difference apart from the Church Pick having a slightly more complicated mechanism is that the Hunter's Axe is a strength-based weapon.
        A few of its attacks in the transformed mode are very similar to that of the Burial Blade.

        The Rifle Spear is carried by a Yahar'Gul Hunter in the Cathedral Ward.
        This fight can be tricky because you first encounter a Yahar'Gul Hunter that uses a Tonitrus near the base of the stairs, and if you advance too far towards the houses, the Rifle Spear Yahar'Gul Hunter will join the fight as well.
        He also uses Ludwig's Rifle, meaning he can hit you from a considerable distance with shotgun pellets no matter what mode he uses for the Rifle Spear.

        Holy Moonlight Sword
        
        
        An arcane sword discovered long ago by Ludwig. 
        When blue moonlight dances around the sword, and it channels the abyssal cosmos, its great blade will hurl a shadowy lightwave. 
        The Holy Moonlight Sword is synonymous with Ludwig, the Holy Blade, but few have ever set eyes on the great blade, and whatever guidance it has to offer, it seems to be of a very private, elusive sort."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Found on the Underground Corpse Pile after the fight against Ludwig, The Holy Blade. Ludwig's head will be lying there and you can:
        Kill the head for the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and talk to the head. When prompted, reply "Yes" and you'll get the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and reply "No", then come back later and Simon the Harrowed will be there and give you the sword.
        NOTE: This weapon is missable. If Lawrence is killed before you obtain it, you will no longer be able to talk to the head or obtain it from Simon.
        
        
        
        It seems to be another reappearance of the Moonlight Greatsword, a recurring item found around FromSoftware's games. Notable examples of such games include the first, second and third Dark Souls games, Demon's Souls, King's Field, Ninja Blade, Enchanted Arms, Armored Core, 3D Dot Game Heroes, and Otogi.

        Rifle Spear
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. A prototype weapon serving as a simple firearm and spear, possibly created in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon. Lacks any notable functions, saving that it is the only trick weapon with an attached gun. "
        
        
        
        It can be found inside a hidden building in Old Yharnam. From the area you fight the first NPC Hunter (who wields a saw spear), drop down where the railing is missing in a corner and land on the ledges below.

        Hunter Axe
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used on the hunt. Retains the qualities of an axe, but offers a wider palette of attacks by transforming. Boasts a heavy blunt attack, leading to high rally potential. No matter their pasts, beasts are no more than beasts. Some choose this axe to play the part of executioner."
        
        
        
        It's possible to pick this trick weapon as a starting weapon near the beginning of Bloodborne.
        If not chosen, it can instead be purchased from the Messengers after the Hunter has found the Saw Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is wielded by Father Gascoigne.
        However, he has a moveset that is different from the Hunter's version.
        He is also capable of using his unique Hunter Pistol even while his Hunter Axe is transformed, which is impossible for the Hunter to do.
        It's also wielded by the Madara's Twin who drops Madara's Whistle when defeated.
        Another hostile hunter NPC wields this trick weapon in the Nightmare Frontier.
        It's been heavily debated by the fanbase whether the transformed mode is a halberd or poleaxe.
        Both forms utilized axe heads with a spear tip at the end (although some poleaxes used hammer heads instead).
        However, neither weapon was known to have extendable handles, which is a special trademark of the Hunter Axe.
        In either case, it's possible this trick weapon was inspired by both weapons and simply incorporated many different designs.
        While wielded in it's transformed mode if the player had a torch equipped in the off-hand beasts afraid of the fire will still recoil in fear of you as if you were brandishing the torch normally (Tested on Beast Patient)

        Kirkhammer
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. On the one side, an easily handled silver sword. On the other, a giant obtuse stone weapon, characterized by a blunt strike and extreme force of impact. The Church takes a heavy-handed, merciless stance toward the plague of beasts, an irony not lost upon the wielders of this most symbolic weapon."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers after acquiring the Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        A miniature of the Kirkhammer was included as the Pre-Order Bonus for Asian editions of Bloodborne. [See the Bundles page for details]
        A "kirk" is an archaic old english word meaning "church."
        This means the weapon is literately known as the Church Hammer.
        The wording also might be a nod to Nordic culture since the word "Kirk" originated from northern England and Old Norse wording.
        The etched wording on the side of the hammer part has similarities to the Old Norse alphabet.
        However, it also has similarities to the Elder Futhark, one of the oldest forms of the runic alphabet system used by Germanic tribes.
        Similar etchings can be found on gravestones all over Yharnam.
        The sword used for this weapon is very similar to the one used for Ludwig's Holy Blade.
        This suggests that the Healing Church used the method of "interchangeable parts" to efficiently mass produce weapons for their hunters.
        However, the sword used for the Kirkhammer is shorter.
        It's wielded by Alfred, should you choose to be friends with him.
        He uses this weapon as a summon.
        However, he wields the Logarius' Wheel if you find him in Cainhurst Castle under special circumstances.
        When untransformed, with the hammer part on the character's back, some cloth parts (capes etc.) of the armor can either get awkwardly stuck on it or cover it.
        Despite being labeled a 'stone weapon', the etchings, wear, and sound produced when it strikes indicate that the hammer is in fact made of metal.

        Kos Parasite
        
        
        When the carcass of Kos washed up on the coast, its insides were teeming with tiny parasites, unlike any found in humans. 
        This atypical weapon can only be clasped tight and swung, but a Kos Parasite is said to stimulate phantasms inhabiting a lumenwood"
        
        
        
        Dropped by Orphan of Kos
        
        
        
        The Kos Parasite is perhaps the most interestingly unique weapon in Bloodborne in various ways: It is one of two weapons that can reach it's full potential while using a rune (the other being Beast Claw), the weapon itself is not held, it is purely an arcane weapon, it is the only weapon directly dropped by defeating a boss, it has the highest durability of any weapon at 600 respectively, it is the only weapon to have an A-scaling of any weapon without any upgrades and is the only weapon to have an S-scaling by upgrading it twice.

        Logarius's Wheel
        
        
        "Weapon wielded by martyr Logarius' band of executioners. 
        Used to slaughter the Vilebloods in Cainhurst. Bathed in pools of their blood, and forever steeped in their ire. 
        Transform to release the power of the wheel and manifest their lingering rage in a show of utter brilliance."
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 13,000 Blood Echoes after acquiring the Wheel Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        Alfred utilizes the Logarius' Wheel when found in Cainhurst Castle.
        This weapon is yet another reference to Berserk, as they are often made in Miyazaki's previous Souls games.
        "Logarius and his band of executioners" bear many similarities to Mozgus, an insanely devout man who traveled the land torturing heretics along with his disciples.
        The wheel in particular was wielded by one of his six disciples, .
        In Dark Souls, Bonewheel Skeletons are another reference to Mozgus' disciples.
        In real life, although wheels weren't typically wielded as weapons, they were commonly used as torture devices, especially during the Middle Ages.
        Torture wheels were nicknamed "breaking wheels," since victims often times would have their limbs broken during the process.
        They were also known as "catherine wheels."
         It's quite possible that Logarius' Wheel also takes some inspiration in its use as a weapon from the English folklore legend of Tom Hickathrift. Tom was a fabled giant killer who made use of a cartwheel to vanquish the Wisbech Giant (also referred to as an ogre).
        Lore theories can be found under "From Berserk to Bloodborne".

        Ludwig's Holy Blade
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. It is said that the silver sword was employed by Ludwig, the first hunter of the church. When transformed, it combines with its sheath to form a greatsword. 
        It exhibits several departures from the workshop's design, suggesting that the Church anticipated much larger inhuman beasts."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased for 20,000 echoes from the Messengers after obtaining the Radiant Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon was wielded by Ludwig, a famous hunter of the Healing Church who designed the blade based on the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        According to the description, Ludwig wielded this sword in combat instead of the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        However, in his boss fight, he wields the Holy Moonlight Sword during a certain part in the fight.
        It is possible that Ludwig wielded the Holy Moonlight Sword and his fellow hunters, inspired by the huge weapon, sought to make replicas. Unable to make a magic sword, a huge metal sheath was the compromise.
        Before the DLC's release, Ludwig's Holy Blade was thought of as From Software's traditional "Moonlight Greatsword" seen throughout various games by the fanbase.
        However, this sword was eventually revealed in the DLC to be a replica of the "true" Moonlight Greatsword in Bloodborne, the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        This isn't the first time Miyazaki used the name of classical music composers in a game.
        A boss from the first "Dark Souls" game, Dragonslayer Ornstein, is named after Leo Ornstein.
        Berlioz from "Armored Core 4" is named after Hector Berlioz.
        The normal form of this weapon is very similar to the sword used for the Kirkhammer.
        However, this sword's normal form has a slightly longer reach when compared to the Kirkhammer's blade.
        The similar nature of these swords suggests that the Healing Church used the method of interchangeable parts to quickly mass produce weapons for their hunters.

        Rakuyo
        
        
        Hunter weapon wielded by Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower. 
        A trick sword originated in the same country as the Cainhurst Chikage, only this sword feeds not off blood, but instead demands great dexterity. 
        Lady Maria was fond of this aspect of the Rakuyo, as she frowned upon blood blades, despite being a distant relative of the queen. 
        One day, she abandoned her beloved Rakuyo, casting it into a dark well, when she could stomach it no longer."
        
        
        
        Fishing Hamlet. Get to the bottom of the well. Can be reached from the underground tunnels at the end of the area or via a ladder in the well right away. In that area a Shark Giant will wander around. Fighting him makes a second one appear after the first reaches sufficiently low health. The first giant will walk over near the ladder and scream at the ceiling, causing the second one to drop. The second one drops the weapon.
        Fighting the two of them can be difficult and it is a good idea to use the Shaman Bone Blade to make them fight each other and finish off the weaker one. Molotov cocktails are also very effective against them. If neither is available to you, try to kill the one with the anchor first, as it is significantly harder to dodge.
        One easy way to beat them is use of ranged weapon like Simon's Bowblade if you are a bloodtinge build, and the Holy Moonlight Sword if you are an arcane build.
        A Threaded Cane's transformed whip can easily hit the giants from the ledge once they're lured over and begin attacking, but be sure to keep your distance after each hit. Except that there is no way to lure them over the the ledge. No ranged weapon will hit the one standing at the back and the one hanging from the ceiling doesn't drop down until the first one is at 50% health. 
        Unlike other giants in the game, these ones are easy to gun parry for a visceral attack. Keep in mind this will get very tricky after the other one starts fighting, so try to separate them and time your viscerals to get the invincibility at the right moment.
        If your range is inadequate you can use the monocular to angle a throwing knife to be able to hit the shark giant in the back. This way, you can continue from the strategy of killing them on the ledge with a gun/magic without going around. (confirmed as of January 19th, 2019)
        Chaining together backstabs is a very effecient way of dealing with them, if played right you should be able to eliminate the first shark giant before the second reaches you this way. It is extremely difficult to get behind the patrolling Shark Giant without him detecting you. 
        For a video showing an easy way to kill the sharks with a monocular and a throwing knife strategy, check .
        
        
        
        Rakuyo (ËêΩËëâ) literally means "falling leaf".

        Reiterpallasch
        
        
        Weapon wielded by the Knights of Cainhurst. 
        Combines an elegant knight's sword with the peculiar firearm wielded by the Cainhurst order. 
        The old nobles, long-time imbibers of blood, are no strangers to the sanguine plague, and the disposal of beasts was a discrete task left to their servants, or knights, as they were called for the sake of appearances."
        
        
        
        It's found in a chest located in the entrance hall of Cainhurst Castle, where the Bound Widows are first encountered. When you first enter the room from the main entrance, run towards your two o'clock. The chest will be found in a corner.
        
        
        
        The Reiterpallasch (from German Reiter "horseback rider" and hungarian pallos [Ààp…ílo É] "sword") is a 17th century Hungarian straight sword with a typically double edged blade and guarded hilt that was used by Hungarian noble cavalry and later adapted by most western European armies.
        As pointed out in its description, the rifle spear is made "possibly in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon" (i.e. this one).
        Wynne D. Fanchon from Armored Core: For Answer; another From Software title, pilots a NEXT named Reiterpallasch.
        Relevant lore theories exist under The Mysteries of Cainhurst Garb and Architecture.
        
        
    

        Rifle Spear
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. A prototype weapon serving as a simple firearm and spear, possibly created in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon.

        Saw Cleaver
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used in the hunting business. 
        This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts, transforms into a long cleaver that makes use of centrifugal force. 
        The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness the more grotesquely transformed the beast."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired as a gift from the Messengers the first time you visit the Hunter's Dream.
        If you don't select it, you may buy it after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne.)
        
        
        
        The Saw Cleaver is the Trick Weapon featured on the title screen.
        It was also one of the first weapons to be revealed for this game.
        Overall the mechanisms of this weapon didn't change at all, starting all the way back when Bloodborne was still known as "Project Beast."
        According to the concept art, the Saw Cleaver uses a trigger mechanism to unlock the joint during transformation.
        The design of the Saw Cleaver seems to be inspired by multiple references:
        The transformed cleaver shows a resemblance to LB-66 MOONLIGHT from Armored Core V.
        The Japanese name is written as "nokogiri nata" („Éé„Ç≥„ÇÆ„É™Èâà) or "saw hatchet". Nokogiri is a traditional Japanese saw that cuts from the pull stroke, as opposed to the more common push stroke.
        In real life, there is a type of cleaver known as a mezzaluna ("half moon") cleaver, known for chopping/mincing up various food products.
        Most of these types of cleavers have handles on both ends.
        However, some use a single handle that stretches across the blade, which was used to chop up herbs usually; the saw cleaver follows this particular model.
        Coincidentally, the Strength/Skill/Arcane scaling at maximum level is "CDC" in their respective order.
        The CDC is an American organization designed to combat and prevent "health threats" of varying natures.
        Since the beast scourge acts like a plague (and is spread due to blood-related reasons), those who wield the Saw Cleaver can be thought of as fighting a dangerous epidemic.
        Henryk uses this weapon when he fights you and Eileen the Crow during her questline, as well as when he is summoned by you when using the Old Hunter Bell.

        Simon's Bowblade
        
        
        Choice weapon of Simon, one of the first Healing Church hunters.
        Simon despised firearms, and so the Church workshop had this specially fashioned to his liking. The large curved blade serves as a bow when transformed.
        But aside from a few close friends, Simon was scoffed at for his choice of arms, for who would dare face the beasts with a measly bow?"

        Stake Driver
        
        
        A trick weapon fashioned by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. Favored by the retired hunter Djura. 
        The stake driver, with its queerly complex design, violently drives thick stakes into the flesh of foes. 
        The stake driver allows for high-damage critical attacks, but is difficult to use and leaves its wielder wide open, but none of this should bother a mere Powder Keg."
        
        
        
        Obtain Powder Keg Hunter Badge to unlock for purchase at the Messengers for 8,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Stake Driver is exclusively wielded by Djura when he is still hostile towards you.
        His fight is tricky because the area around him is very limited, meaning you can fall to your death if you're not careful.
        Furthermore, the limited space is perfect for his choice of weapon which has a short range.
        This is modeled after the "Pile Bunker," a type of fictional weaponry which launches piston with gunpowder or explosion.
        In the Japanese version of Bloodborne, this weapon is literally called the Pile Hammer („Éë„Ç§„É´„Éè„É≥„Éû„Éº).
        It bears a striking resemblance to the "Parrying Blade" weapons seen in several "Armored Core" games.
        Has the highest charged attack multiplier out of any other weapon.

        Threaded Cane
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used by hunters on their duties. Sufficiently deadly as a rigid bladed cane, but also serves as a whip when its blade is split into many. Concealing the weapon inside the cane and flogging the beasts with the whip is partly an act of ceremony, an attempt to demonstrate to oneself that the bloodlust of the hunt will never encroach upon the soul."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired at the beginning of the game as a gift from the Messengers.
        If not selected, it is later available for purchase from the blood fountain messengers after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne).
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is used by Iosefka, Last Scholar Yurie and the Frontier Church Hunter.
        Gehrman carries a generic cane in the Workshop instead of the Threaded Cane.
        This trick weapon is possibly inspired by the sword used by Jean-Fran√ßois de Morangias in the climactic battle of French action-horror film Brotherhood of the Wolf (which bears many other similarities to Bloodborne), or the sword used by a bandit leader in the anime/manga series Claymore. Both these weapons act as a straight, double-edged sword that can transform into a segmented, bladed whip.

        Tonitrus
        
        
        "A unique trick weapon contrived by Archibald, the infamous eccentric of the Healing Church workshop. 
        Striking this peculiar iron morning star flail like a match generates the same blue sparks that blanket a darkbeast. 
        Unfortunately, for reasons untold, the hunters of Archibald's time did not fully take to the device."
        
        
        
        Acquire the Spark Hunter Badge by defeating Darkbeast Paarl  to purchase from Messengers.
        Treasure: Yahar'gul, Unseen Village, at the top end of the road. (guarded by 2 Tainted Dogs and a Snatcher during daytime)
        
        
        
        Tonitrus is a Latin word meaning "thunder."
        The in-game description classifies this trick weapon as a morning star flail, but it's actually modeled in the form of a mace.
        The description of Archibald bears many similarities to Nikola Tesla, a famed inventor in real life who specialized in the field of electricity.
        Nikola Tesla created the Tesla Coil, a device that also bears many similarities to the Tonitrus.
        The Tonitrus also bears similarities with the aspergillum, a device used by the Roman Catholic Church to sprinkle holy water.
        According to the description of the Spark Hunter Badge, Archibald was associated with the Healing Church.
        In this sense, it may have been designed under the themes of "purificiation" and "cleansing" that is associated with many Healing Church trick weapons/tools.
        However, due to Archibald's fascination with Dark Beasts, it's more likely he designed the Tonitrus as a measure to replicate the sparks these creatures could unleash.

        That particular weapon may or may not be the Reiterpallasch.
        It should be noted these two weapons are the only two skill/firearm hybrids whose alternate forms utilize guns.
        The third skill/firearm hybrid weapon in this game is Simon's Bowblade, which transforms from a sword into a bow.
        The Rifle Spear is carried by a Yahar'Gul Hunter in the Cathedral Ward.
        This fight can be tricky because you first encounter a Yahar'Gul Hunter that uses a Tonitrus near the base of the stairs, and if you advance too far towards the houses, the Rifle Spear Yahar'Gul Hunter will join the fight as well.
        He also uses Ludwig's Rifle, meaning he can hit you from a considerable distance with shotgun pellets no matter what mode he uses for the Rifle Spear.

        Whirligig Saw
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs, and weapon of choice of the Old Hunter Valtr, the Beast Eater. 
        This weapon pummels beasts in its mace form, but its true strength lies in its attached mechanical saws. 
        These discs, lined with serrated teeth,spin rapidly, thrashing the flesh of beasts into fine shreds."
        
        
        
        From the Nightmare Church go down the stairs and follow the path. Drop down into the pools of blood of follow the path further until you reach the Cannon Executioner. Follow the left wall and turn down the path, the weapon is at the end.
        
        
        
        If you use the L2 buzzsaw attack against Orphan of Kos and hold it in place, it attempts to make an immediate counterattack for each time it gets hit by the whirring blades, only to get interrupted by the next hit. It shrieks every time it attacks, so as a result, it lets loose dozens of overlapping shriek sound effects for as long as you hold it in place.
        A whirligig is defined as a toy that is constantly spinning, such as a top or pinwheel, or as something regarded as hectic and constantly changing.
        Similar to most Powder Keg weapons sharing homage to Armored Core weapons, the Whirligig Saw is based on the Grind Blade.
        
    

        Saw Cleaver
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used in the hunting business. 
        This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts, transforms into a long cleaver that makes use of centrifugal force. 
        The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness the more grotesquely transformed the beast."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired as a gift from the Messengers the first time you visit the Hunter's Dream.
        If you don't select it, you may buy it after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne.)
        
        
        
        The Saw Cleaver is the Trick Weapon featured on the title screen.
        It was also one of the first weapons to be revealed for this game.
        Overall the mechanisms of this weapon didn't change at all, starting all the way back when Bloodborne was still known as "Project Beast."
        According to the concept art, the Saw Cleaver uses a trigger mechanism to unlock the joint during transformation.
        The design of the Saw Cleaver seems to be inspired by multiple references:
        The transformed cleaver shows a resemblance to LB-66 MOONLIGHT from Armored Core V.
        The Japanese name is written as "nokogiri nata" („Éé„Ç≥„ÇÆ„É™Èâà) or "saw hatchet". Nokogiri is a traditional Japanese saw that cuts from the pull stroke, as opposed to the more common push stroke.
        In real life, there is a type of cleaver known as a mezzaluna ("half moon") cleaver, known for chopping/mincing up various food products.
        Most of these types of cleavers have handles on both ends.
        However, some use a single handle that stretches across the blade, which was used to chop up herbs usually; the saw cleaver follows this particular model.
        Coincidentally, the Strength/Skill/Arcane scaling at maximum level is "CDC" in their respective order.
        The CDC is an American organization designed to combat and prevent "health threats" of varying natures.
        Since the beast scourge acts like a plague (and is spread due to blood-related reasons), those who wield the Saw Cleaver can be thought of as fighting a dangerous epidemic.
        Henryk uses this weapon when he fights you and Eileen the Crow during her questline, as well as when he is summoned by you when using the Old Hunter Bell.

        Amygdalan Arm 
        
        
        The arm of a small Amygdala Great One. 
        Strictly speaking, the Amygdalan Arm is no trick weapon of any sort, but certain madmen wield them like clubs. 
        Starts as a large, tough blunt weapon formed of bone, but when extended, the hand quivers as if it were still alive.
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare, cave at the end of the blood river to the right after getting out of the building that used to be the shortcut to the Cleric Beast in the main game. Gatling Gun Hunter dropping the Gatling Gun and a Blood-Starved Beast can be also found here. Arm is near the Blood-Starved Beast at the end of the cave.
        
        
        
        The Amygdalan Arm is a Trick Weapon in name only, considering that it is an arm obtained from Amygdala.
        The arm is remarkably small, as even the Lesser Amygdalae are huge. Perhaps it came from a newborn Amygdala.
        The arm could be the inspiration behind the Burial Blade.

        Beastly weapon wielded by Irreverent Izzy.
        Crafted by chiseling the long bones of an undead darkbeast and fastening them to the weapon. The bones are still alive, and when unleashed, grant its wielder a spurt of beastly power. 
        As flesh is flayed and blood is sprayed, the beast within awakens, and in time, the wielder of this weapon surges with both strength and feverish reverie."
        
        
        
        Ailing Loran Chalice: Layer 2 treasure room. Room is on the right when exiting the elevator from first layer boss fight, before the second layers lantern.
        Can be bought from messengers for 34000 echoes after acquisition.
        Can be bought from messengers after co-operation with player who has them. This only occurs in Hunter's dream before fight with Gehrman or Moon Presence. It is not needed to complete any Chalice Dungeons. It is unknown if this is glitch or intentional. Was patched by 1.07 or 1.08.
        
        
        
        When this weapon is equipped, your gloves will be replaced by two bone gauntlets. This can allow for the lost art of rapid glove changing if you switch your weapons really fast.
        You can charge the beasthood meter on the first windows (Gilbert) of Central Yharnam
        In the past, there was a rare glitch that allowed a player to obtain this weapon without finding it in the Chalice Dungeons.
        It has since been patched, although it isn't quite known when it was successfully patched.

        A trick weapon used by the old hunters. 
        A second blade is found inside the curve of the main one. In its initial form, the saif can be wielded like a long curved sword, but when transformed, its blade is contracted, allowing for quick, repeated stabs. 
        Although this trick weapon allows for adaptive combat, it was later replaced by saws and similar weapons that were more effective at disposing of beasts."

Climb the ladder on the left of the pit and instead of going forward, turn to the left and drop down the ledge. There will be a single piece of loot guarded by a Saif Hunter.

        Beast Cutter
        
        
        A trick weapon used by Old Hunters. 
        This thick iron cleaver slices through the toughest of beast hides, and when transformed the blade splits into sections, allowing one to lash it in the fashion of a heavy whip. 
        This crude weapon relies on brute force and is regrettably inelegant, suggesting that the hunts of the earliest hunters made for horrific affairs, painted in sanguine black and reds."
        
        
        
        When walking up the stairs to the nightmare version of the Grand Cathedral, turn left onto a small platform, then roll off and walk down some rough terrain to find the weapon on a corpse.
        
        
        
        Reminds many of the Zanpakut≈ç , a fictional segmented sword that can function as a whip. It is an iconic weapon from the Bleach anime.
        The untransformed form of the weapon is a cleaver-like serrated club, and it really looks like the samoan war club "Nifo Oti".

        Blade of mercy
        
        
        A special trick weapon passed down among hunters of hunters. One of the oldest weapons of the workshop. 
        Splits into two when activated. The weapon's warped blades are forged with siderite, a rare mineral of the heavens. Most effective swift attacks,such as after a quick-stepping."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers for 40000 echoes after obtaining the Crow Hunter Badge from Eileen the Crow's quest line.
        Killing Eileen is also a way to get the weapon early in the game.
        While progressing through Eileen's quest, it's possible for her to be killed by Henryk and thus drop the Crow Hunter Badge as a result, although the quest line will end.
        
        
        
        The Blade of Mercy was originally named as "Warped Twinblades" during the Alpha test, and it was the tool of choice for the "agile" hunter.
        Both the Burial Blade and Blade of Mercy make mentions of a mineral known as siderite in their descriptions.
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite, and it seems to be the reason why arcane power has direct scaling with both blade's damage output. Due to its extraterrestrial origins, that may explain why it cannot be buffed by an external source of any sort.
        It loosely resembles the Eleum Loyce from Dark Souls 2, a sword with two blades at the front.

        Return to the underground prison (from the underground corpse pile lamp, go up the stairs and turn left) and open the door to Brador's cell. His cell is the second on the left behind a flight of downward stairs. Kill Brador to obtain the bloodletter.

        The Japanese name is written as "nokogiri nata" („Éé„Ç≥„ÇÆ„É™Èâà) or "saw hatchet". Nokogiri is a traditional Japanese saw that cuts from the pull stroke, as opposed to the more common push stroke.
        In real life, there is a type of cleaver known as a mezzaluna ("half moon") cleaver, known for chopping/mincing up various food products.
        Most of these types of cleavers have handles on both ends.
        However, some use a single handle that stretches across the blade, which was used to chop up herbs usually; the saw cleaver follows this particular model.
        Coincidentally, the Strength/Skill/Arcane scaling at maximum level is "CDC" in their respective order.
        The CDC is an American organization designed to combat and prevent "health threats" of varying natures.
        Since the beast scourge acts like a plague (and is spread due to blood-related reasons), those who wield the Saw Cleaver can be thought of as fighting a dangerous epidemic.

        Boom Hammer
        
        
        A trick weapon used by the old hunters, and crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. 
        A giant hammer equipped with a miniature furnace. When ignited and fired, it emits a volley of flame that explodes furiously upon impact. 
        Crush the beasts, then burn them - the brute simplicity of the Boom Hammer was favored by hunters with an acute distaste for beasts."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare. Inside a house that looks out of Central Yharnam, the same that is the shortcut to the cleric beast in the main game, where the 10 quicksilver bullets used to be. Be sure to shoot the explosives around the item (or act fast), as the wheelchair huntsman's corpse conceals a delayed molotov set to trigger when you try to grab the Boom Hammer, potential killing you in a huge blast.
        
        
        
        When the Boomhammer is lit, Beast Patient mobs will back away from the player as if they had a torch equipped. (May need to initiate primed attack first)

        Burial Blade
        
        
        Trick weapon wielded by Gehrman, the first hunter." 
        A masterpiece that defined the entire array of weapons crafted at the workshop. Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens. 
        Gehrman surely saw the hunt as a dirge of farewell, wishing only that his prey might rest in peace, never again to awaken to another harrowing nightmare. "
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 60,000 Blood Echoes after defeating Gehrman, the First Hunter and acquiring the Old Hunter Badge from him.
        To make Gehrman fight you, the "Refuse" option must be selected.
        If one accepts his proposal, the game will outright end there and it will be impossible to obtain this weapon in that playthrough (not including the uncanny/lost forms found in the chalice dungeons).
        Normally, the Burial Blade can only be obtained in NG+ and beyond. However, one can bypass this by using Bold Hunter's Mark, or being killed, during The Moon Presence boss battle.
        
        
        
         The Burial Blade was the first trick weapon ever created, and it inspired others to develop new trick weapons, usually on the premise of adapting to different combat scenerios.
        Not all weapons adapt to different combat scenerios (e.g. Tonitrus), but the Burial Blade still inspired an entire series of weapons that could "transform" to satisfy different purposes.
        It was created, and exclusively wielded, by Gehrman.
        A Burial Blade can be found above the workshop table in the Hunter's Dream.
        The weapon's description mentions that "Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens."
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite. Due to its extraterrestrial nature, it could be the reason why it has direct scaling with arcane and cannot be tampered by external sources.
        Both the Burial Blade and the Blade of Mercy mentions the use of it in their descriptions.
        Interestingly enough, these two weapons also resemble the talons of Mergo's Wet Nurse.
        The shape of the scythe highly resembles Rurufon's scythe from Shadow Tower Abyss, an early title created by From Software as well as being recurring weapons in Souls series.
        A strange bug on rare occurrences the cape on the hunter may come off, usually in a boss fight you could notice if you dodge back and do an R1 combo the cape disappears. [Note, I haven't seen this happen in a while, it's possible that it may have been fixed, but I'll need confirmation on this]

        Chikage
        
        
        Foreign-made weapon wielded by the royal guards who protect Annalise, Queen of the Vilebloods at Cainhurst Castle. 
        When the intricate, rippled engraving that spans the Chikage's blade is imbrued with blood, the sword sings in scarlet hues. 
        However, the rite eats away at the wielder's very essence."
        
        
        
        Join the Cainhurst Vilebloods covenant available at Cainhurst Castle, and then purchase from the Messengers for 50,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Chikage isn't actually a katana - it is a katana/european sword hybrid. Its short crossguard resembles the one of an early viking sword, or the one of a xiphos (greek sword). The closest european crossguard shape with  this sword is the one of a Karabela (a polish sabre). In other hand, the  hilt and pommel resemble the ones of a longsword (a bit longer, to get easier katana traditional jutsu swings), while the blade shape and the 2-handed fighting style is very similar to a katana. A possible explanation for the origin of this hybrid is that the katana's design was imported to Cainhurst, where some modifications were made to create a sword similar to that commonly used by their knights.
        The Chikage is an allusion to a particular 'breed' of Katanas in the Souls games. While it is similar to both the Hiltless and Chaos Blade from Demon's Souls and Dark Souls respectively, the Chikage bears a stronger resemblance to the Magic Sword "Makoto" (also from Demon's Souls). The Makoto is the only one the bunch to actually DRAIN the user's HP over time, rather than decrease it with each successful swing.
        Chikage (ÂçÉÊôØ) literally means "Thousands Views", however if you separated the word into Chi Kage (Ë°ÄÂΩ±), it means "Blood Shadow". This could be correlated to the fact that Shadows Of Yharnam wield a similar katana with a slight  crossguard, however without using the bloodtinge.
        The transforming attack has the hunter sheathe the Chikage before unleashing a strike. This is a reference to Iaijutsu, a traditional Japanese sword technique that focuses on quick-drawing. At its finest, Iaijutse allows the warrior to unsheathe and strike at incredible speeds.
        The name seems to be a tribute to Chikage Yamamura (mentioned as a "special thanks" in credits)
        The name may also be a reference to the work "1000 Plateaus" by Giles Deluze and Felix Guattari, a famous philosophical essay about fluidity and functionality, maybe dirrectly tied to the esoteric nature of the weapons function.

        Church Pick
        
        
        One of the old trick weapons of the Healing Church, a hunting weapon formed from one of the giant picks that appear in old beast tales. 
        The Church Pick initially serves as a large sword, but when transformed functions as an extended war pick. In spite of its origins, it is a highly practical weapon."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Dropped by a hunter wearing Yahar'Gul set (presumably, this is the summonable Old Hunter Defector Antal) in one of the cells that you open with the Underground Cell Key from the Research Hall. To make this battle simple, attack him through the door with a strong R2 attack, then leave the room. He will lose sight of you and his AI will return to a standstill behind the door. Rinse and repeat until dead.
        
        
        
        The Church Pick And The Hunter's Axe both have similar appearance. When transformed, both are wielded as a polearm and have the same de-transformation attack. The only difference apart from the Church Pick having a slightly more complicated mechanism is that the Hunter's Axe is a strength-based weapon.
        A few of its attacks in the transformed mode are very similar to that of the Burial Blade.
        The Church Pick os the weapon of choice of the summonable Old Hunter NPC Defector Antal

        Holy Moonlight Sword
        
        
        An arcane sword discovered long ago by Ludwig. 
        When blue moonlight dances around the sword, and it channels the abyssal cosmos, its great blade will hurl a shadowy lightwave. 
        The Holy Moonlight Sword is synonymous with Ludwig, the Holy Blade, but few have ever set eyes on the great blade, and whatever guidance it has to offer, it seems to be of a very private, elusive sort."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Found on the Underground Corpse Pile after the fight against Ludwig, The Holy Blade. Ludwig's head will be lying there and you can:
        Kill the head for the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and talk to the head. When prompted, reply "Yes" and you'll get the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and reply "No", then come back later and Simon the Harrowed will be there and give you the sword.
        NOTE: This weapon is missable. If Lawrence is killed before you obtain it, you will no longer be able to talk to the head or obtain it from Simon.
        
        
        
        It seems to be another reappearance of the Moonlight Greatsword, a recurring item found around FromSoftware's games. Notable examples of such games include the first, second and third Dark Souls games, Demon's Souls, King's Field, Ninja Blade, Enchanted Arms, Armored Core, 3D Dot Game Heroes, and Otogi.
        Lore theories exist under "Ebrietas Lore".

        Hunter Axe
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used on the hunt. Retains the qualities of an axe, but offers a wider palette of attacks by transforming. Boasts a heavy blunt attack, leading to high rally potential. No matter their pasts, beasts are no more than beasts. Some choose this axe to play the part of executioner."
        
        
        
        It's possible to pick this trick weapon as a starting weapon near the beginning of Bloodborne.
        If not chosen, it can instead be purchased from the Messengers after the Hunter has found the Saw Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is wielded by Father Gascoigne.
        However, he has a moveset that is different from the Hunter's version.
        He is also capable of using his unique Hunter Pistol even while his Hunter Axe is transformed, which is impossible for the Hunter to do.
        It's also wielded by the Madara's Twin who drops Madara's Whistle when defeated.
        Another hostile hunter NPC wields this trick weapon in the Nightmare Frontier.
        It's been heavily debated by the fanbase whether the transformed mode is a halberd or poleaxe.
        Both forms utilized axe heads with a spear tip at the end (although some poleaxes used hammer heads instead).
        However, neither weapon was known to have extendable handles, which is a special trademark of the Hunter Axe.
        In either case, it's possible this trick weapon was inspired by both weapons and simply incorporated many different designs.
        While wielded in it's transformed mode if the player had a torch equipped in the off-hand beasts afraid of the fire will still recoil in fear of you as if you were brandishing the torch normally (Tested on Beast Patient)

        According to the concept art, the Saw Cleaver uses a trigger mechanism to unlock the joint during transformation.
        The design of the Saw Cleaver seems to be inspired by multiple references:
        The transformed cleaver shows a resemblance to LB-66 MOONLIGHT from Armored Core V.
        The Japanese name is written as "nokogiri nata" („Éé„Ç≥„ÇÆ„É™Èâà) or "saw hatchet". Nokogiri is a traditional Japanese saw that cuts from the pull stroke, as opposed to the more common push stroke.
        In real life, there is a type of cleaver known as a mezzaluna ("half moon") cleaver, known for chopping/mincing up various food products.
        Most of these types of cleavers have handles on both ends.
        However, some use a single handle that stretches across the blade, which was used to chop up herbs usually; the saw cleaver follows this particular model.
        Coincidentally, the Strength/Skill/Arcane scaling at maximum level is "CDC" in their respective order.
        The CDC is an American organization designed to combat and prevent "health threats" of varying natures.

        Kirkhammer
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. On the one side, an easily handled silver sword. On the other, a giant obtuse stone weapon, characterized by a blunt strike and extreme force of impact. The Church takes a heavy-handed, merciless stance toward the plague of beasts, an irony not lost upon the wielders of this most symbolic weapon."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers after acquiring the Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        A miniature of the Kirkhammer was included as the Pre-Order Bonus for Asian editions of Bloodborne. [See the Bundles page for details]
        A "kirk" is an archaic old english word meaning "church."
        This means the weapon is literately known as the Church Hammer.
        The wording also might be a nod to Nordic culture since the word "Kirk" originated from northern England and Old Norse wording.
        The etched wording on the side of the hammer part has similarities to the Old Norse alphabet.
        However, it also has similarities to the Elder Futhark, one of the oldest forms of the runic alphabet system used by Germanic tribes.
        Similar etchings can be found on gravestones all over Yharnam.
        The sword used for this weapon is very similar to the one used for Ludwig's Holy Blade.
        This suggests that the Healing Church used the method of "interchangeable parts" to efficiently mass produce weapons for their hunters.
        However, the sword used for the Kirkhammer is shorter.
        It's wielded by Alfred, should you choose to be friends with him.
        He uses this weapon as a summon.
        However, he wields the Logarius' Wheel if you find him in Cainhurst Castle under special circumstances.
        When untransformed, with the hammer part on the character's back, some cloth parts (capes etc.) of the armor can either get awkwardly stuck on it or cover it.
        Despite being labeled a 'stone weapon', the etchings, wear, and sound produced when it strikes indicate that the hammer is in fact made of metal.
        
        
    

        Saw Cleaver
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used in the hunting business. 
        This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts, transforms into a long cleaver that makes use of centrifugal force. 
        The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness the more grotesquely transformed the beast."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired as a gift from the Messengers the first time you visit the Hunter's Dream.
        If you don't select it, you may buy it after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne.)

        Kos Parasite
        
        
        When the carcass of Kos washed up on the coast, its insides were teeming with tiny parasites, unlike any found in humans. 
        This atypical weapon can only be clasped tight and swung, but a Kos Parasite is said to stimulate phantasms inhabiting a lumenwood"
        
        
        
        Dropped by Orphan of Kos
        
        
        
        The Kos Parasite is perhaps the most interestingly unique weapon in Bloodborne in various ways: It is one of two weapons that can reach it's full potential while using a rune (the other being Beast Claw), the weapon itself is not held, it is purely an arcane weapon, it is the only weapon directly dropped by defeating a boss, it has the highest durability of any weapon at 600 respectively, it is the only weapon to have an A-scaling of any weapon without any upgrades and is the only weapon to have an S-scaling by upgrading it twice.

        Logarius's Wheel
        
        
        "Weapon wielded by martyr Logarius' band of executioners. 
        Used to slaughter the Vilebloods in Cainhurst. Bathed in pools of their blood, and forever steeped in their ire. 
        Transform to release the power of the wheel and manifest their lingering rage in a show of utter brilliance."
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 13,000 Blood Echoes after acquiring the Wheel Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        Alfred utilizes the Logarius' Wheel when found in Cainhurst Castle.
        This weapon is yet another reference to Berserk, as they are often made in Miyazaki's previous Souls games.
        "Logarius and his band of executioners" bear many similarities to Mozgus, an insanely devout man who traveled the land torturing heretics along with his disciples.
        The wheel in particular was wielded by one of his six disciples, .
        In Dark Souls, Bonewheel Skeletons are another reference to Mozgus' disciples.
        In real life, although wheels weren't typically wielded as weapons, they were commonly used as torture devices, especially during the Middle Ages.
        Torture wheels were nicknamed "breaking wheels," since victims often times would have their limbs broken during the process.
        They were also known as "catherine wheels."
         It's quite possible that Logarius' Wheel also takes some inspiration in its use as a weapon from the English folklore legend of Tom Hickathrift. Tom was a fabled giant killer who made use of a cartwheel to vanquish the Wisbech Giant (also referred to as an ogre).
        Lore theories can be found under "From Berserk to Bloodborne".

        Ludwig's Holy Blade
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. It is said that the silver sword was employed by Ludwig, the first hunter of the church. When transformed, it combines with its sheath to form a greatsword. 
        It exhibits several departures from the workshop's design, suggesting that the Church anticipated much larger inhuman beasts."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased for 20,000 echoes from the Messengers after obtaining the Radiant Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon was wielded by Ludwig, a famous hunter of the Healing Church who designed the blade based on the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        According to the description, Ludwig wielded this sword in combat instead of the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        However, in his boss fight, he wields the Holy Moonlight Sword during a certain part in the fight.
        It is possible that Ludwig wielded the Holy Moonlight Sword and his fellow hunters, inspired by the huge weapon, sought to make replicas. Unable to make a magic sword, a huge metal sheath was the compromise.
        Before the DLC's release, Ludwig's Holy Blade was thought of as From Software's traditional "Moonlight Greatsword" seen throughout various games by the fanbase.
        However, this sword was eventually revealed in the DLC to be a replica of the "true" Moonlight Greatsword in Bloodborne, the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        This isn't the first time Miyazaki used the name of classical music composers in a game.
        A boss from the first "Dark Souls" game, Dragonslayer Ornstein, is named after Leo Ornstein.
        Berlioz from "Armored Core 4" is named after Hector Berlioz.
        The normal form of this weapon is very similar to the sword used for the Kirkhammer.
        However, this sword's normal form has a slightly longer reach when compared to the Kirkhammer's blade.
        The similar nature of these swords suggests that the Healing Church used the method of interchangeable parts to quickly mass produce weapons for their hunters.
        Lore theories exist under Ebrietas Lore.

        Rakuyo
        
        
        Hunter weapon wielded by Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower. 
        A trick sword originated in the same country as the Cainhurst Chikage, only this sword feeds not off blood, but instead demands great dexterity. 
        Lady Maria was fond of this aspect of the Rakuyo, as she frowned upon blood blades, despite being a distant relative of the queen. 
        One day, she abandoned her beloved Rakuyo, casting it into a dark well, when she could stomach it no longer."
        
        
        
        Fishing Hamlet. Get to the bottom of the well. Can be reached from the underground tunnels at the end of the area or via a ladder in the well right away. In that area a Shark Giant will wander around. Fighting him makes a second one appear after the first reaches sufficiently low health. The first giant will walk over near the ladder and scream at the ceiling, causing the second one to drop. The second one drops the weapon.
        Fighting the two of them can be difficult and it is a good idea to use the Shaman Bone Blade to make them fight each other and finish off the weaker one. Molotov cocktails are also very effective against them. If neither is available to you, try to kill the one with the anchor first, as it is significantly harder to dodge.
        One easy way to beat them is use of ranged weapon like Simon's Bowblade if you are a bloodtinge build, and the Holy Moonlight Sword if you are an arcane build.
        A Threaded Cane's transformed whip can easily hit the giants from the ledge once they're lured over and begin attacking, but be sure to keep your distance after each hit. Except that there is no way to lure them over the the ledge. No ranged weapon will hit the one standing at the back and the one hanging from the ceiling doesn't drop down until the first one is at 50% health. 
        Unlike other giants in the game, these ones are easy to gun parry for a visceral attack. Keep in mind this will get very tricky after the other one starts fighting, so try to separate them and time your viscerals to get the invincibility at the right moment.
        If your range is inadequate you can use the monocular to angle a throwing knife to be able to hit the shark giant in the back. This way, you can continue from the strategy of killing them on the ledge with a gun/magic without going around. (confirmed as of January 19th, 2019)
        Chaining together backstabs is a very effecient way of dealing with them, if played right you should be able to eliminate the first shark giant before the second reaches you this way. It is extremely difficult to get behind the patrolling Shark Giant without him detecting you. 
        For a video showing an easy way to kill the sharks with a monocular and a throwing knife strategy, check .
        
        
        
        Rakuyo (ËêΩËëâ) literally means "falling leaf".
        The sword of Rakuyo bears resemblance to the "ky≈´ gunt≈ç", which was a hybrid of the sabre/katana with a handguard, used during the Russo-Japanese War.

        Reiterpallasch
        
        
        Weapon wielded by the Knights of Cainhurst. 
        Combines an elegant knight's sword with the peculiar firearm wielded by the Cainhurst order. 
        The old nobles, long-time imbibers of blood, are no strangers to the sanguine plague, and the disposal of beasts was a discrete task left to their servants, or knights, as they were called for the sake of appearances."
        
        
        
        It's found in a chest located in the entrance hall of Cainhurst Castle, where the Bound Widows are first encountered. When you first enter the room from the main entrance, run towards your two o'clock. The chest will be found in a corner.
        
        
        
        The Reiterpallasch (from German Reiter "horseback rider" and hungarian pallos [Ààp…ílo É] "sword") is a 17th century Hungarian straight sword with a typically double edged blade and guarded hilt that was used by Hungarian noble cavalry and later adapted by most western European armies.
        As pointed out in its description, the rifle spear is made "possibly in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon" (i.e. this one).
        Wynne D. Fanchon from Armored Core: For Answer; another From Software title, pilots a NEXT named Reiterpallasch.

        The Saw Cleaver is the Trick Weapon featured on the title screen.
        It was also one of the first weapons to be revealed for this game.
        Overall the mechanisms of this weapon didn't change at all, starting all the way back when Bloodborne was still known as "Project Beast."
        According to the concept art, the Saw Cleaver uses a trigger mechanism to unlock the joint during transformation.
        The design of the Saw Cleaver seems to be inspired by multiple references:
        The transformed cleaver shows a resemblance to LB-66 MOONLIGHT from Armored Core V.
        The Japanese name is written as "nokogiri nata" („Éé„Ç≥„ÇÆ„É™Èâà) or "saw hatchet". Nokogiri is a traditional Japanese saw that cuts from the pull stroke, as opposed to the more common push stroke.
        In real life, there is a type of cleaver known as a mezzaluna ("half moon") cleaver, known for chopping/mincing up various food products.
        Most of these types of cleavers have handles on both ends.
        However, some use a single handle that stretches across the blade, which was used to chop up herbs usually; the saw cleaver follows this particular model.
        Coincidentally, the Strength/Skill/Arcane scaling at maximum level is "CDC" in their respective order.
        The CDC is an American organization designed to combat and prevent "health threats" of varying natures.
        Since the beast scourge acts like a plague (and is spread due to blood-related reasons), those who wield the Saw Cleaver can be thought of as fighting a dangerous epidemic.
        Henryk uses this weapon when he fights you and Eileen the Crow during her questline, as well as when he is summoned by you when using the Old Hunter Bell.

        Rifle Spear
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. A prototype weapon serving as a simple firearm and spear, possibly created in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon. Lacks any notable functions, saving that it is the only trick weapon with an attached gun. "
        
        
        
        It can be found inside a hidden building in Old Yharnam. From the area you fight the first NPC Hunter (who wields a saw spear), drop down where the railing is missing in a corner and land on the ledges below. Go into the building and follow the stairs up; eventually you can find it stashed on a corpse tucked away in a hidden nook as you advance.
        Bought from the messengers for 4000 blood echoes after acquiring the Powder Keg Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        According to the Rifle Spear's description, it was designed as an imitation of "a lost Cainhurst weapon".
        That particular weapon may or may not be the Reiterpallasch.
        It should be noted these two weapons are the only two skill/firearm hybrids whose alternate forms utilize guns.
        The third skill/firearm hybrid weapon in this game is Simon's Bowblade, which transforms from a sword into a bow.
        The Rifle Spear is carried by a Yahar'Gul Hunter in the Cathedral Ward.
        This fight can be tricky because you first encounter a Yahar'Gul Hunter that uses a Tonitrus near the base of the stairs, and if you advance too far towards the houses, the Rifle Spear Yahar'Gul Hunter will join the fight as well.
        He also uses Ludwig's Rifle, meaning he can hit you from a considerable distance with shotgun pellets no matter what mode he uses for the Rifle Spear.
        
        
    

        Saw Cleaver

        Choice weapon of Simon, one of the first Healing Church hunters.
        Simon despised firearms, and so the Church workshop had this specially fashioned to his liking. The large curved blade serves as a bow when transformed.
        But aside from a few close friends, Simon was scoffed at for his choice of arms, for who would dare face the beasts with a measly bow?"
        
        
        
        Fishing Hamlet: Found on the body of Simon the Harrowed next to the Lighthouse Hut lantern after answering the first option at the Hunter's Nightmare shortcut and going through his quest-line. Interact with him as he lies on the ground to obtain the weapon.
        You may also kill Simon the Harrowed at The Hunter's Nightmare or Research Hall to obtain the weapon.

        Stake Driver
        
        
        A trick weapon fashioned by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. Favored by the retired hunter Djura. 
        The stake driver, with its queerly complex design, violently drives thick stakes into the flesh of foes. 
        The stake driver allows for high-damage critical attacks, but is difficult to use and leaves its wielder wide open, but none of this should bother a mere Powder Keg."
        
        
        
        Obtain Powder Keg Hunter Badge to unlock for purchase at the Messengers for 8,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Stake Driver is exclusively wielded by Djura when he is still hostile towards you.
        His fight is tricky because the area around him is very limited, meaning you can fall to your death if you're not careful.
        Furthermore, the limited space is perfect for his choice of weapon which has a short range.
        This is modeled after the "Pile Bunker," a type of fictional weaponry which launches piston with gunpowder or explosion.
        In the Japanese version of Bloodborne, this weapon is literally called the Pile Hammer („Éë„Ç§„É´„Éè„É≥„Éû„Éº).
        It bears a striking resemblance to the "Parrying Blade" weapons seen in several "Armored Core" games.
        Has the highest charged attack multiplier out of any other weapon.

        Threaded Cane
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used by hunters on their duties. Sufficiently deadly as a rigid bladed cane, but also serves as a whip when its blade is split into many. Concealing the weapon inside the cane and flogging the beasts with the whip is partly an act of ceremony, an attempt to demonstrate to oneself that the bloodlust of the hunt will never encroach upon the soul."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired at the beginning of the game as a gift from the Messengers.
        If not selected, it is later available for purchase from the blood fountain messengers after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne).
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is used by Iosefka, Last Scholar Yurie and the Frontier Church Hunter.
        Gehrman carries a generic cane in the Workshop instead of the Threaded Cane.
        This trick weapon is possibly inspired by the sword used by Jean-Fran√ßois de Morangias in the climactic battle of French action-horror film Brotherhood of the Wolf (which bears many other similarities to Bloodborne), or the sword used by a bandit leader in the anime/manga series Claymore. Both these weapons act as a straight, double-edged sword that can transform into a segmented, bladed whip.

        Tonitrus
        
        
        "A unique trick weapon contrived by Archibald, the infamous eccentric of the Healing Church workshop. 
        Striking this peculiar iron morning star flail like a match generates the same blue sparks that blanket a darkbeast. 
        Unfortunately, for reasons untold, the hunters of Archibald's time did not fully take to the device."
        
        
        
        Acquire the Spark Hunter Badge by defeating Darkbeast Paarl  to purchase from Messengers.
        Treasure: Yahar'gul, Unseen Village, at the top end of the road. (guarded by 2 Tainted Dogs and a Snatcher during daytime)
        
        
        
        Tonitrus is a Latin word meaning "thunder."
        The in-game description classifies this trick weapon as a morning star flail, but it's actually modeled in the form of a mace.
        The description of Archibald bears many similarities to Nikola Tesla, a famed inventor in real life who specialized in the field of electricity.
        Nikola Tesla created the Tesla Coil, a device that also bears many similarities to the Tonitrus.
        The Tonitrus also bears similarities with the aspergillum, a device used by the Roman Catholic Church to sprinkle holy water.
        According to the description of the Spark Hunter Badge, Archibald was associated with the Healing Church.
        In this sense, it may have been designed under the themes of "purificiation" and "cleansing" that is associated with many Healing Church trick weapons/tools.
        However, due to Archibald's fascination with Dark Beasts, it's more likely he designed the Tonitrus as a measure to replicate the sparks these creatures could unleash.
        
        
    

        Saw Cleaver
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used in the hunting business. 
        This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts, transforms into a long cleaver that makes use of centrifugal force. 
        The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness the more grotesquely transformed the beast."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired as a gift from the Messengers the first time you visit the Hunter's Dream.
        If you don't select it, you may buy it after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne.)
        
        
        
        The Saw Cleaver is the Trick Weapon featured on the title screen.
        It was also one of the first weapons to be revealed for this game.
        Overall the mechanisms of this weapon didn't change at all, starting all the way back when Bloodborne was still known as "Project Beast."
        According to the concept art, the Saw Cleaver uses a trigger mechanism to unlock the joint during transformation.
        The design of the Saw Cleaver seems to be inspired by multiple references:
        The transformed cleaver shows a resemblance to LB-66 MOONLIGHT from Armored Core V.
        The Japanese name is written as "nokogiri nata" („Éé„Ç≥„ÇÆ„É™Èâà) or "saw hatchet". Nokogiri is a traditional Japanese saw that cuts from the pull stroke, as opposed to the more common push stroke.
        In real life, there is a type of cleaver known as a mezzaluna ("half moon") cleaver, known for chopping/mincing up various food products.
        Most of these types of cleavers have handles on both ends.
        However, some use a single handle that stretches across the blade, which was used to chop up herbs usually; the saw cleaver follows this particular model.
        Coincidentally, the Strength/Skill/Arcane scaling at maximum level is "CDC" in their respective order.
        The CDC is an American organization designed to combat and prevent "health threats" of varying natures.
        Since the beast scourge acts like a plague (and is spread due to blood-related reasons), those who wield the Saw Cleaver can be thought of as fighting a dangerous epidemic.

        Whirligig Saw
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs, and weapon of choice of the Old Hunter Valtr, the Beast Eater. 
        This weapon pummels beasts in its mace form, but its true strength lies in its attached mechanical saws. 
        These discs, lined with serrated teeth,spin rapidly, thrashing the flesh of beasts into fine shreds."
        
        
        
        From the Nightmare Church go down the stairs and follow the path. Drop down into the pools of blood of follow the path further until you reach the Cannon Executioner. Follow the left wall and turn down the path, the weapon is at the end.
        
        
        
        If you use the L2 buzzsaw attack against Orphan of Kos and hold it in place, it attempts to make an immediate counterattack for each time it gets hit by the whirring blades, only to get interrupted by the next hit. It shrieks every time it attacks, so as a result, it lets loose dozens of overlapping shriek sound effects for as long as you hold it in place.
        A whirligig is defined as a toy that is constantly spinning, such as a top or pinwheel, or as something regarded as hectic and constantly changing.
        Similar to most Powder Keg weapons sharing homage to Armored Core weapons, the Whirligig Saw is based on the Grind Blade.
        
    

        Saw Spear
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used by those who dedicate themselves to the hunt. This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts, transforms into a medium-range spear. The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness the more grotesquely transformed the beast."
        
        
        
        Can be bought from the Bath Messengers, after obtaining the Saw Hunter Badge, for 1,000 Blood Echoes.
        Treasure in Central Yharnam Sewer, on the ledge above the dead end with boats. You also need to cut down the corpse hanging from the rafters high above.

        Amygdalan Arm 
        
        
        The arm of a small Amygdala Great One. 
        Strictly speaking, the Amygdalan Arm is no trick weapon of any sort, but certain madmen wield them like clubs. 
        Starts as a large, tough blunt weapon formed of bone, but when extended, the hand quivers as if it were still alive.
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare, cave at the end of the blood river to the right after getting out of the building that used to be the shortcut to the Cleric Beast in the main game. Gatling Gun Hunter dropping the Gatling Gun and a Blood-Starved Beast can be also found here. Arm is near the Blood-Starved Beast at the end of the cave.
        
        
        
        The Amygdalan Arm is a Trick Weapon in name only, considering that it is an arm obtained from Amygdala.
        The arm is remarkably small, as even the Lesser Amygdalae are huge. Perhaps it came from a newborn Amygdala.
        The arm could be the inspiration behind the Burial Blade.

        Beast Claw
        
        
        Beastly weapon wielded by Irreverent Izzy.
        Crafted by chiseling the long bones of an undead darkbeast and fastening them to the weapon. The bones are still alive, and when unleashed, grant its wielder a spurt of beastly power. 
        As flesh is flayed and blood is sprayed, the beast within awakens, and in time, the wielder of this weapon surges with both strength and feverish reverie."
        
        
        
        Ailing Loran Chalice: Layer 2 treasure room. Room is on the right when exiting the elevator from first layer boss fight, before the second layers lantern.
        Can be bought from messengers for 34000 echoes after acquisition.
        Can be bought from messengers after co-operation with player who has them. This only occurs in Hunter's dream before fight with Gehrman or Moon Presence. It is not needed to complete any Chalice Dungeons. It is unknown if this is glitch or intentional. Was patched by 1.07 or 1.08.
        
        
        
        When this weapon is equipped, your gloves will be replaced by two bone gauntlets. This can allow for the lost art of rapid glove changing if you switch your weapons really fast.
        You can charge the beasthood meter on the first windows (Gilbert) of Central Yharnam
        In the past, there was a rare glitch that allowed a player to obtain this weapon without finding it in the Chalice Dungeons.
        It has since been patched, although it isn't quite known when it was successfully patched.

        Beasthunter Saif
        
        
        A trick weapon used by the old hunters. 
        A second blade is found inside the curve of the main one. In its initial form, the saif can be wielded like a long curved sword, but when transformed, its blade is contracted, allowing for quick, repeated stabs. 
        Although this trick weapon allows for adaptive combat, it was later replaced by saws and similar weapons that were more effective at disposing of beasts."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare. After the Blood River, when you pass through the cave with a tick, where you encounter two dogs and a large amount of crows along with an enemy Beast Cutter hunter. Climb the ladder on the left of the pit and instead of going forward, turn to the left and drop down the ledge. There will be a single piece of loot guarded by a Saif Hunter.

        Beast Cutter
        
        
        A trick weapon used by Old Hunters. 
        This thick iron cleaver slices through the toughest of beast hides, and when transformed the blade splits into sections, allowing one to lash it in the fashion of a heavy whip. 
        This crude weapon relies on brute force and is regrettably inelegant, suggesting that the hunts of the earliest hunters made for horrific affairs, painted in sanguine black and reds."
        
        
        
        When walking up the stairs to the nightmare version of the Grand Cathedral, turn left onto a small platform, then roll off and walk down some rough terrain to find the weapon on a corpse.
        
        
        
        Reminds many of the Zanpakut≈ç , a fictional segmented sword that can function as a whip. It is an iconic weapon from the Bleach anime.
        The untransformed form of the weapon is a cleaver-like serrated club, and it really looks like the samoan war club "Nifo Oti".

        Blade of mercy
        
        
        A special trick weapon passed down among hunters of hunters. One of the oldest weapons of the workshop. 
        Splits into two when activated. The weapon's warped blades are forged with siderite, a rare mineral of the heavens. Most effective swift attacks,such as after a quick-stepping."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers for 40000 echoes after obtaining the Crow Hunter Badge from Eileen the Crow's quest line.
        Killing Eileen is also a way to get the weapon early in the game.
        While progressing through Eileen's quest, it's possible for her to be killed by Henryk and thus drop the Crow Hunter Badge as a result, although the quest line will end.
        
        
        
        The Blade of Mercy was originally named as "Warped Twinblades" during the Alpha test, and it was the tool of choice for the "agile" hunter.
        Both the Burial Blade and Blade of Mercy make mentions of a mineral known as siderite in their descriptions.
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite, and it seems to be the reason why arcane power has direct scaling with both blade's damage output. Due to its extraterrestrial origins, that may explain why it cannot be buffed by an external source of any sort.
        It loosely resembles the Eleum Loyce from Dark Souls 2, a sword with two blades at the front.

        The demented hunter weapon brandished by Brador, the Healing Church assassin. 
        The Bloodletter assumes its true and terrifying form after it draws upon blood from the inner reaches of one's body and soul. 
        This is the only effective means of expelling tainted blood, or so Brador, isolated in his cell, continued to believe."
        
        
        
        Obtain the underground cell inner chamber key.
        Return to the underground prison (from the underground corpse pile lamp, go up the stairs and turn left) and open the door to Brador's cell. His cell is the second on the left behind a flight of downward stairs. Kill Brador to obtain the bloodletter.
        Brador will not be hostile in his cell, but will invade the player right outside his cell.

        Boom Hammer
        
        
        A trick weapon used by the old hunters, and crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. 
        A giant hammer equipped with a miniature furnace. When ignited and fired, it emits a volley of flame that explodes furiously upon impact. 
        Crush the beasts, then burn them - the brute simplicity of the Boom Hammer was favored by hunters with an acute distaste for beasts."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare. Inside a house that looks out of Central Yharnam, the same that is the shortcut to the cleric beast in the main game, where the 10 quicksilver bullets used to be. Be sure to shoot the explosives around the item (or act fast), as the wheelchair huntsman's corpse conceals a delayed molotov set to trigger when you try to grab the Boom Hammer, potential killing you in a huge blast.

        Burial Blade
        
        
        Trick weapon wielded by Gehrman, the first hunter." 
        A masterpiece that defined the entire array of weapons crafted at the workshop. Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens. 
        Gehrman surely saw the hunt as a dirge of farewell, wishing only that his prey might rest in peace, never again to awaken to another harrowing nightmare. "
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 60,000 Blood Echoes after defeating Gehrman, the First Hunter and acquiring the Old Hunter Badge from him.
        To make Gehrman fight you, the "Refuse" option must be selected.
        If one accepts his proposal, the game will outright end there and it will be impossible to obtain this weapon in that playthrough (not including the uncanny/lost forms found in the chalice dungeons).
        Normally, the Burial Blade can only be obtained in NG+ and beyond. However, one can bypass this by using Bold Hunter's Mark, or being killed, during The Moon Presence boss battle.
        
        
        
         The Burial Blade was the first trick weapon ever created, and it inspired others to develop new trick weapons, usually on the premise of adapting to different combat scenerios.
        Not all weapons adapt to different combat scenerios (e.g. Tonitrus), but the Burial Blade still inspired an entire series of weapons that could "transform" to satisfy different purposes.
        It was created, and exclusively wielded, by Gehrman.
        A Burial Blade can be found above the workshop table in the Hunter's Dream.
        The weapon's description mentions that "Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens."
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite. Due to its extraterrestrial nature, it could be the reason why it has direct scaling with arcane and cannot be tampered by external sources.
        Both the Burial Blade and the Blade of Mercy mentions the use of it in their descriptions.
        Interestingly enough, these two weapons also resemble the talons of Mergo's Wet Nurse.
        The shape of the scythe highly resembles Rurufon's scythe from Shadow Tower Abyss, an early title created by From Software as well as being recurring weapons in Souls series.
        A strange bug on rare occurrences the cape on the hunter may come off, usually in a boss fight you could notice if you dodge back and do an R1 combo the cape disappears. [Note, I haven't seen this happen in a while, it's possible that it may have been fixed, but I'll need confirmation on this]

        When the intricate, rippled engraving that spans the Chikage's blade is imbrued with blood, the sword sings in scarlet hues. 
        However, the rite eats away at the wielder's very essence."
        
        
        
        Join the Cainhurst Vilebloods covenant available at Cainhurst Castle, and then purchase from the Messengers for 50,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Chikage isn't actually a katana - it is a katana/european sword hybrid. Its short crossguard resembles the one of an early viking sword, or the one of a xiphos (greek sword). The closest european crossguard shape with  this sword is the one of a Karabela (a polish sabre). In other hand, the  hilt and pommel resemble the ones of a longsword (a bit longer, to get easier katana traditional jutsu swings), while the blade shape and the 2-handed fighting style is very similar to a katana. A possible explanation for the origin of this hybrid is that the katana's design was imported to Cainhurst, where some modifications were made to create a sword similar to that commonly used by their knights.
        The Chikage is an allusion to a particular 'breed' of Katanas in the Souls games. While it is similar to both the Hiltless and Chaos Blade from Demon's Souls and Dark Souls respectively, the Chikage bears a stronger resemblance to the Magic Sword "Makoto" (also from Demon's Souls). The Makoto is the only one the bunch to actually DRAIN the user's HP over time, rather than decrease it with each successful swing.
        Chikage (ÂçÉÊôØ) literally means "Thousands Views", however if you separated the word into Chi Kage (Ë°ÄÂΩ±), it means "Blood Shadow". This could be correlated to the fact that Shadows Of Yharnam wield a similar katana with a slight  crossguard, however without using the bloodtinge.
        The transforming attack has the hunter sheathe the Chikage before unleashing a strike. This is a reference to Iaijutsu, a traditional Japanese sword technique that focuses on quick-drawing. At its finest, Iaijutse allows the warrior to unsheathe and strike at incredible speeds.
        The name seems to be a tribute to Chikage Yamamura (mentioned as a "special thanks" in credits)
        The name may also be a reference to the work "1000 Plateaus" by Giles Deluze and Felix Guattari, a famous philosophical essay about fluidity and functionality, maybe dirrectly tied to the esoteric nature of the weapons function.  
        
        
    

        Saw Spear
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used by those who dedicate themselves to the hunt. This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts, transforms into a medium-range spear. The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness the more grotesquely transformed the beast."
        
        
        
        Can be bought from the Bath Messengers, after obtaining the Saw Hunter Badge, for 1,000 Blood Echoes.
        Treasure in Central Yharnam Sewer, on the ledge above the dead end with boats. You also need to cut down the corpse hanging from the rafters high above.

        Church Pick
        
        
        One of the old trick weapons of the Healing Church, a hunting weapon formed from one of the giant picks that appear in old beast tales. 
        The Church Pick initially serves as a large sword, but when transformed functions as an extended war pick. In spite of its origins, it is a highly practical weapon."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Dropped by a hunter wearing Yahar'Gul set (presumably, this is the summonable Old Hunter Defector Antal) in one of the cells that you open with the Underground Cell Key from the Research Hall. To make this battle simple, attack him through the door with a strong R2 attack, then leave the room. He will lose sight of you and his AI will return to a standstill behind the door. Rinse and repeat until dead.
        
        
        
        The Church Pick And The Hunter's Axe both have similar appearance. When transformed, both are wielded as a polearm and have the same de-transformation attack. The only difference apart from the Church Pick having a slightly more complicated mechanism is that the Hunter's Axe is a strength-based weapon.
        A few of its attacks in the transformed mode are very similar to that of the Burial Blade.
        The Church Pick os the weapon of choice of the summonable Old Hunter NPC Defector Antal

        Holy Moonlight Sword
        
        
        An arcane sword discovered long ago by Ludwig. 
        When blue moonlight dances around the sword, and it channels the abyssal cosmos, its great blade will hurl a shadowy lightwave. 
        The Holy Moonlight Sword is synonymous with Ludwig, the Holy Blade, but few have ever set eyes on the great blade, and whatever guidance it has to offer, it seems to be of a very private, elusive sort."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Found on the Underground Corpse Pile after the fight against Ludwig, The Holy Blade. Ludwig's head will be lying there and you can:
        Kill the head for the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and talk to the head. When prompted, reply "Yes" and you'll get the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and reply "No", then come back later and Simon the Harrowed will be there and give you the sword.
        NOTE: This weapon is missable. If Lawrence is killed before you obtain it, you will no longer be able to talk to the head or obtain it from Simon.
        
        
        
        It seems to be another reappearance of the Moonlight Greatsword, a recurring item found around FromSoftware's games. Notable examples of such games include the first, second and third Dark Souls games, Demon's Souls, King's Field, Ninja Blade, Enchanted Arms, Armored Core, 3D Dot Game Heroes, and Otogi.

        Hunter Axe
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used on the hunt. Retains the qualities of an axe, but offers a wider palette of attacks by transforming. Boasts a heavy blunt attack, leading to high rally potential. No matter their pasts, beasts are no more than beasts. Some choose this axe to play the part of executioner."
        
        
        
        It's possible to pick this trick weapon as a starting weapon near the beginning of Bloodborne.
        If not chosen, it can instead be purchased from the Messengers after the Hunter has found the Saw Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is wielded by Father Gascoigne.
        However, he has a moveset that is different from the Hunter's version.
        He is also capable of using his unique Hunter Pistol even while his Hunter Axe is transformed, which is impossible for the Hunter to do.
        It's also wielded by the Madara's Twin who drops Madara's Whistle when defeated.
        Another hostile hunter NPC wields this trick weapon in the Nightmare Frontier.
        It's been heavily debated by the fanbase whether the transformed mode is a halberd or poleaxe.
        Both forms utilized axe heads with a spear tip at the end (although some poleaxes used hammer heads instead).
        However, neither weapon was known to have extendable handles, which is a special trademark of the Hunter Axe.
        In either case, it's possible this trick weapon was inspired by both weapons and simply incorporated many different designs.
        While wielded in it's transformed mode if the player had a torch equipped in the off-hand beasts afraid of the fire will still recoil in fear of you as if you were brandishing the torch normally (Tested on Beast Patient)

        Kirkhammer
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. On the one side, an easily handled silver sword. On the other, a giant obtuse stone weapon, characterized by a blunt strike and extreme force of impact. The Church takes a heavy-handed, merciless stance toward the plague of beasts, an irony not lost upon the wielders of this most symbolic weapon."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers after acquiring the Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        A miniature of the Kirkhammer was included as the Pre-Order Bonus for Asian editions of Bloodborne. [See the Bundles page for details]
        A "kirk" is an archaic old english word meaning "church."
        This means the weapon is literately known as the Church Hammer.
        The wording also might be a nod to Nordic culture since the word "Kirk" originated from northern England and Old Norse wording.
        The etched wording on the side of the hammer part has similarities to the Old Norse alphabet.
        However, it also has similarities to the Elder Futhark, one of the oldest forms of the runic alphabet system used by Germanic tribes.
        Similar etchings can be found on gravestones all over Yharnam.
        The sword used for this weapon is very similar to the one used for Ludwig's Holy Blade.
        This suggests that the Healing Church used the method of "interchangeable parts" to efficiently mass produce weapons for their hunters.
        However, the sword used for the Kirkhammer is shorter.
        It's wielded by Alfred, should you choose to be friends with him.
        He uses this weapon as a summon.
        However, he wields the Logarius' Wheel if you find him in Cainhurst Castle under special circumstances.
        When untransformed, with the hammer part on the character's back, some cloth parts (capes etc.) of the armor can either get awkwardly stuck on it or cover it.
        Despite being labeled a 'stone weapon', the etchings, wear, and sound produced when it strikes indicate that the hammer is in fact made of metal.

        Kos Parasite
        
        
        When the carcass of Kos washed up on the coast, its insides were teeming with tiny parasites, unlike any found in humans. 
        This atypical weapon can only be clasped tight and swung, but a Kos Parasite is said to stimulate phantasms inhabiting a lumenwood"
        
        
        
        Dropped by Orphan of Kos
        
        
        
        The Kos Parasite is perhaps the most interestingly unique weapon in Bloodborne in various ways: It is one of two weapons that can reach it's full potential while using a rune (the other being Beast Claw), the weapon itself is not held, it is purely an arcane weapon, it is the only weapon directly dropped by defeating a boss, it has the highest durability of any weapon at 600 respectively, it is the only weapon to have an A-scaling of any weapon without any upgrades and is the only weapon to have an S-scaling by upgrading it twice.

        Logarius's Wheel
        
        
        "Weapon wielded by martyr Logarius' band of executioners. 
        Used to slaughter the Vilebloods in Cainhurst. Bathed in pools of their blood, and forever steeped in their ire. 
        Transform to release the power of the wheel and manifest their lingering rage in a show of utter brilliance."
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 13,000 Blood Echoes after acquiring the Wheel Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        Alfred utilizes the Logarius' Wheel when found in Cainhurst Castle.
        This weapon is yet another reference to Berserk, as they are often made in Miyazaki's previous Souls games.
        "Logarius and his band of executioners" bear many similarities to Mozgus, an insanely devout man who traveled the land torturing heretics along with his disciples.
        The wheel in particular was wielded by one of his six disciples, .
        In Dark Souls, Bonewheel Skeletons are another reference to Mozgus' disciples.
        In real life, although wheels weren't typically wielded as weapons, they were commonly used as torture devices, especially during the Middle Ages.
        Torture wheels were nicknamed "breaking wheels," since victims often times would have their limbs broken during the process.
        They were also known as "catherine wheels."
         It's quite possible that Logarius' Wheel also takes some inspiration in its use as a weapon from the English folklore legend of Tom Hickathrift. Tom was a fabled giant killer who made use of a cartwheel to vanquish the Wisbech Giant (also referred to as an ogre).
        Lore theories can be found under "From Berserk to Bloodborne".

        Ludwig's Holy Blade
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. It is said that the silver sword was employed by Ludwig, the first hunter of the church. When transformed, it combines with its sheath to form a greatsword. 
        It exhibits several departures from the workshop's design, suggesting that the Church anticipated much larger inhuman beasts."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased for 20,000 echoes from the Messengers after obtaining the Radiant Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon was wielded by Ludwig, a famous hunter of the Healing Church who designed the blade based on the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        According to the description, Ludwig wielded this sword in combat instead of the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        However, in his boss fight, he wields the Holy Moonlight Sword during a certain part in the fight.
        It is possible that Ludwig wielded the Holy Moonlight Sword and his fellow hunters, inspired by the huge weapon, sought to make replicas. Unable to make a magic sword, a huge metal sheath was the compromise.
        Before the DLC's release, Ludwig's Holy Blade was thought of as From Software's traditional "Moonlight Greatsword" seen throughout various games by the fanbase.
        However, this sword was eventually revealed in the DLC to be a replica of the "true" Moonlight Greatsword in Bloodborne, the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        This isn't the first time Miyazaki used the name of classical music composers in a game.
        A boss from the first "Dark Souls" game, Dragonslayer Ornstein, is named after Leo Ornstein.
        Berlioz from "Armored Core 4" is named after Hector Berlioz.
        The normal form of this weapon is very similar to the sword used for the Kirkhammer.
        However, this sword's normal form has a slightly longer reach when compared to the Kirkhammer's blade.
        The similar nature of these swords suggests that the Healing Church used the method of interchangeable parts to quickly mass produce weapons for their hunters.
        Lore theories exist under Ebrietas Lore.

        Rakuyo
        
        
        Hunter weapon wielded by Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower. 
        A trick sword originated in the same country as the Cainhurst Chikage, only this sword feeds not off blood, but instead demands great dexterity. 
        Lady Maria was fond of this aspect of the Rakuyo, as she frowned upon blood blades, despite being a distant relative of the queen. 
        One day, she abandoned her beloved Rakuyo, casting it into a dark well, when she could stomach it no longer."
        
        
        
        Fishing Hamlet. Get to the bottom of the well. Can be reached from the underground tunnels at the end of the area or via a ladder in the well right away. In that area a Shark Giant will wander around. Fighting him makes a second one appear after the first reaches sufficiently low health. The first giant will walk over near the ladder and scream at the ceiling, causing the second one to drop. The second one drops the weapon.
        Fighting the two of them can be difficult and it is a good idea to use the Shaman Bone Blade to make them fight each other and finish off the weaker one. Molotov cocktails are also very effective against them. If neither is available to you, try to kill the one with the anchor first, as it is significantly harder to dodge.
        One easy way to beat them is use of ranged weapon like Simon's Bowblade if you are a bloodtinge build, and the Holy Moonlight Sword if you are an arcane build.
        A Threaded Cane's transformed whip can easily hit the giants from the ledge once they're lured over and begin attacking, but be sure to keep your distance after each hit. Except that there is no way to lure them over the the ledge. No ranged weapon will hit the one standing at the back and the one hanging from the ceiling doesn't drop down until the first one is at 50% health. 
        Unlike other giants in the game, these ones are easy to gun parry for a visceral attack. Keep in mind this will get very tricky after the other one starts fighting, so try to separate them and time your viscerals to get the invincibility at the right moment.
        If your range is inadequate you can use the monocular to angle a throwing knife to be able to hit the shark giant in the back. This way, you can continue from the strategy of killing them on the ledge with a gun/magic without going around. (confirmed as of January 19th, 2019)
        Chaining together backstabs is a very effecient way of dealing with them, if played right you should be able to eliminate the first shark giant before the second reaches you this way. It is extremely difficult to get behind the patrolling Shark Giant without him detecting you. 
        For a video showing an easy way to kill the sharks with a monocular and a throwing knife strategy, check .
        
        
        
        Rakuyo (ËêΩËëâ) literally means "falling leaf".
        The sword of Rakuyo bears resemblance to the "ky≈´ gunt≈ç", which was a hybrid of the sabre/katana with a handguard, used during the Russo-Japanese War.

        The old nobles, long-time imbibers of blood, are no strangers to the sanguine plague, and the disposal of beasts was a discrete task left to their servants, or knights, as they were called for the sake of appearances."
        
        
        
        It's found in a chest located in the entrance hall of Cainhurst Castle, where the Bound Widows are first encountered. When you first enter the room from the main entrance, run towards your two o'clock. The chest will be found in a corner.
        
        
        
        The Reiterpallasch (from German Reiter "horseback rider" and hungarian pallos [Ààp…ílo É] "sword") is a 17th century Hungarian straight sword with a typically double edged blade and guarded hilt that was used by Hungarian noble cavalry and later adapted by most western European armies.
        As pointed out in its description, the rifle spear is made "possibly in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon" (i.e. this one).
        Wynne D. Fanchon from Armored Core: For Answer; another From Software title, pilots a NEXT named Reiterpallasch.
        Relevant lore theories exist under The Mysteries of Cainhurst Garb and Architecture.
        
        
    

        Saw Spear
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used by those who dedicate themselves to the hunt. This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts, transforms into a medium-range spear. The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness the more grotesquely transformed the beast."
        
        
        
        Can be bought from the Bath Messengers, after obtaining the Saw Hunter Badge, for 1,000 Blood Echoes.
        Treasure in Central Yharnam Sewer, on the ledge above the dead end with boats. You also need to cut down the corpse hanging from the rafters high above.

        Rifle Spear
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. A prototype weapon serving as a simple firearm and spear, possibly created in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon. Lacks any notable functions, saving that it is the only trick weapon with an attached gun. "
        
        
        
        It can be found inside a hidden building in Old Yharnam. From the area you fight the first NPC Hunter (who wields a saw spear), drop down where the railing is missing in a corner and land on the ledges below. Go into the building and follow the stairs up; eventually you can find it stashed on a corpse tucked away in a hidden nook as you advance.
        Bought from the messengers for 4000 blood echoes after acquiring the Powder Keg Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        According to the Rifle Spear's description, it was designed as an imitation of "a lost Cainhurst weapon".
        That particular weapon may or may not be the Reiterpallasch.
        It should be noted these two weapons are the only two skill/firearm hybrids whose alternate forms utilize guns.
        The third skill/firearm hybrid weapon in this game is Simon's Bowblade, which transforms from a sword into a bow.
        The Rifle Spear is carried by a Yahar'Gul Hunter in the Cathedral Ward.
        This fight can be tricky because you first encounter a Yahar'Gul Hunter that uses a Tonitrus near the base of the stairs, and if you advance too far towards the houses, the Rifle Spear Yahar'Gul Hunter will join the fight as well.
        He also uses Ludwig's Rifle, meaning he can hit you from a considerable distance with shotgun pellets no matter what mode he uses for the Rifle Spear.

        Saw Cleaver
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used in the hunting business. 
        This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts, transforms into a long cleaver that makes use of centrifugal force. 
        The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness the more grotesquely transformed the beast."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired as a gift from the Messengers the first time you visit the Hunter's Dream.
        If you don't select it, you may buy it after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne.)
        
        
        
        The Saw Cleaver is the Trick Weapon featured on the title screen.
        It was also one of the first weapons to be revealed for this game.
        Overall the mechanisms of this weapon didn't change at all, starting all the way back when Bloodborne was still known as "Project Beast."
        According to the concept art, the Saw Cleaver uses a trigger mechanism to unlock the joint during transformation.
        The design of the Saw Cleaver seems to be inspired by multiple references:
        The transformed cleaver shows a resemblance to LB-66 MOONLIGHT from Armored Core V.
        The Japanese name is written as "nokogiri nata" („Éé„Ç≥„ÇÆ„É™Èâà) or "saw hatchet". Nokogiri is a traditional Japanese saw that cuts from the pull stroke, as opposed to the more common push stroke.
        In real life, there is a type of cleaver known as a mezzaluna ("half moon") cleaver, known for chopping/mincing up various food products.
        Most of these types of cleavers have handles on both ends.
        However, some use a single handle that stretches across the blade, which was used to chop up herbs usually; the saw cleaver follows this particular model.
        Coincidentally, the Strength/Skill/Arcane scaling at maximum level is "CDC" in their respective order.
        The CDC is an American organization designed to combat and prevent "health threats" of varying natures.
        Since the beast scourge acts like a plague (and is spread due to blood-related reasons), those who wield the Saw Cleaver can be thought of as fighting a dangerous epidemic.
        Henryk uses this weapon when he fights you and Eileen the Crow during her questline, as well as when he is summoned by you when using the Old Hunter Bell.

        Simon's Bowblade
        
        
        Choice weapon of Simon, one of the first Healing Church hunters.
        Simon despised firearms, and so the Church workshop had this specially fashioned to his liking. The large curved blade serves as a bow when transformed.
        But aside from a few close friends, Simon was scoffed at for his choice of arms, for who would dare face the beasts with a measly bow?"
        
        
        
        Fishing Hamlet: Found on the body of Simon the Harrowed next to the Lighthouse Hut lantern after answering the first option at the Hunter's Nightmare shortcut and going through his quest-line. Interact with him as he lies on the ground to obtain the weapon.
        You may also kill Simon the Harrowed at The Hunter's Nightmare or Research Hall to obtain the weapon.

        Stake Driver
        
        
        A trick weapon fashioned by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. Favored by the retired hunter Djura. 
        The stake driver, with its queerly complex design, violently drives thick stakes into the flesh of foes. 
        The stake driver allows for high-damage critical attacks, but is difficult to use and leaves its wielder wide open, but none of this should bother a mere Powder Keg."
        
        
        
        Obtain Powder Keg Hunter Badge to unlock for purchase at the Messengers for 8,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Stake Driver is exclusively wielded by Djura when he is still hostile towards you.
        His fight is tricky because the area around him is very limited, meaning you can fall to your death if you're not careful.
        Furthermore, the limited space is perfect for his choice of weapon which has a short range.
        This is modeled after the "Pile Bunker," a type of fictional weaponry which launches piston with gunpowder or explosion.
        In the Japanese version of Bloodborne, this weapon is literally called the Pile Hammer („Éë„Ç§„É´„Éè„É≥„Éû„Éº).
        It bears a striking resemblance to the "Parrying Blade" weapons seen in several "Armored Core" games.
        Has the highest charged attack multiplier out of any other weapon.

        Threaded Cane
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used by hunters on their duties. Sufficiently deadly as a rigid bladed cane, but also serves as a whip when its blade is split into many. Concealing the weapon inside the cane and flogging the beasts with the whip is partly an act of ceremony, an attempt to demonstrate to oneself that the bloodlust of the hunt will never encroach upon the soul."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired at the beginning of the game as a gift from the Messengers.
        If not selected, it is later available for purchase from the blood fountain messengers after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne).
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is used by Iosefka, Last Scholar Yurie and the Frontier Church Hunter.
        Gehrman carries a generic cane in the Workshop instead of the Threaded Cane.
        This trick weapon is possibly inspired by the sword used by Jean-Fran√ßois de Morangias in the climactic battle of French action-horror film Brotherhood of the Wolf (which bears many other similarities to Bloodborne), or the sword used by a bandit leader in the anime/manga series Claymore. Both these weapons act as a straight, double-edged sword that can transform into a segmented, bladed whip.

        Tonitrus
        
        
        "A unique trick weapon contrived by Archibald, the infamous eccentric of the Healing Church workshop. 
        Striking this peculiar iron morning star flail like a match generates the same blue sparks that blanket a darkbeast. 
        Unfortunately, for reasons untold, the hunters of Archibald's time did not fully take to the device."
        
        
        
        Acquire the Spark Hunter Badge by defeating Darkbeast Paarl  to purchase from Messengers.
        Treasure: Yahar'gul, Unseen Village, at the top end of the road. (guarded by 2 Tainted Dogs and a Snatcher during daytime)
        
        
        
        Tonitrus is a Latin word meaning "thunder."
        The in-game description classifies this trick weapon as a morning star flail, but it's actually modeled in the form of a mace.
        The description of Archibald bears many similarities to Nikola Tesla, a famed inventor in real life who specialized in the field of electricity.
        Nikola Tesla created the Tesla Coil, a device that also bears many similarities to the Tonitrus.
        The Tonitrus also bears similarities with the aspergillum, a device used by the Roman Catholic Church to sprinkle holy water.
        According to the description of the Spark Hunter Badge, Archibald was associated with the Healing Church.
        In this sense, it may have been designed under the themes of "purificiation" and "cleansing" that is associated with many Healing Church trick weapons/tools.
        However, due to Archibald's fascination with Dark Beasts, it's more likely he designed the Tonitrus as a measure to replicate the sparks these creatures could unleash.

        Whirligig Saw
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs, and weapon of choice of the Old Hunter Valtr, the Beast Eater. 
        This weapon pummels beasts in its mace form, but its true strength lies in its attached mechanical saws. 
        These discs, lined with serrated teeth,spin rapidly, thrashing the flesh of beasts into fine shreds."
        
        
        
        From the Nightmare Church go down the stairs and follow the path. Drop down into the pools of blood of follow the path further until you reach the Cannon Executioner. Follow the left wall and turn down the path, the weapon is at the end.
        
        
        
        If you use the L2 buzzsaw attack against Orphan of Kos and hold it in place, it attempts to make an immediate counterattack for each time it gets hit by the whirring blades, only to get interrupted by the next hit. It shrieks every time it attacks, so as a result, it lets loose dozens of overlapping shriek sound effects for as long as you hold it in place.
        A whirligig is defined as a toy that is constantly spinning, such as a top or pinwheel, or as something regarded as hectic and constantly changing.
        Similar to most Powder Keg weapons sharing homage to Armored Core weapons, the Whirligig Saw is based on the Grind Blade.

        Amygdalan Arm 
        
        
        The arm of a small Amygdala Great One. 
        Strictly speaking, the Amygdalan Arm is no trick weapon of any sort, but certain madmen wield them like clubs. 
        Starts as a large, tough blunt weapon formed of bone, but when extended, the hand quivers as if it were still alive.
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare, cave at the end of the blood river to the right after getting out of the building that used to be the shortcut to the Cleric Beast in the main game. Gatling Gun Hunter dropping the Gatling Gun and a Blood-Starved Beast can be also found here. Arm is near the Blood-Starved Beast at the end of the cave.
        
        
        
        The Amygdalan Arm is a Trick Weapon in name only, considering that it is an arm obtained from Amygdala.
        The arm is remarkably small, as even the Lesser Amygdalae are huge. Perhaps it came from a newborn Amygdala.
        The arm could be the inspiration behind the Burial Blade.

        Beastly weapon wielded by Irreverent Izzy.
        Crafted by chiseling the long bones of an undead darkbeast and fastening them to the weapon. The bones are still alive, and when unleashed, grant its wielder a spurt of beastly power.

        Can be bought from messengers after co-operation with player who has them. This only occurs in Hunter's dream before fight with Gehrman or Moon Presence. It is not needed to complete any Chalice Dungeons. It is unknown if this is glitch or intentional. Was patched by 1.07 or 1.08.
        
        
        
        When this weapon is equipped, your gloves will be replaced by two bone gauntlets. This can allow for the lost art of rapid glove changing if you switch your weapons really fast.

        It has since been patched, although it isn't quite known when it was successfully patched.

        Choice weapon of Simon, one of the first Healing Church hunters.
        Simon despised firearms, and so the Church workshop had this specially fashioned to his liking. The large curved blade serves as a bow when transformed.
        But aside from a few close friends, Simon was scoffed at for his choice of arms, for who would dare face the beasts with a measly bow?"

        Beasthunter Saif
        
        
        A trick weapon used by the old hunters. 
        A second blade is found inside the curve of the main one. In its initial form, the saif can be wielded like a long curved sword, but when transformed, its blade is contracted, allowing for quick, repeated stabs. 
        Although this trick weapon allows for adaptive combat, it was later replaced by saws and similar weapons that were more effective at disposing of beasts."

        Beast Cutter
        
        
        A trick weapon used by Old Hunters. 
        This thick iron cleaver slices through the toughest of beast hides, and when transformed the blade splits into sections, allowing one to lash it in the fashion of a heavy whip. 
        This crude weapon relies on brute force and is regrettably inelegant, suggesting that the hunts of the earliest hunters made for horrific affairs, painted in sanguine black and reds."
        
        
        
        When walking up the stairs to the nightmare version of the Grand Cathedral, turn left onto a small platform, then roll off and walk down some rough terrain to find the weapon on a corpse.
        
        
        
        Reminds many of the Zanpakut≈ç , a fictional segmented sword that can function as a whip. It is an iconic weapon from the Bleach anime.
        The untransformed form of the weapon is a cleaver-like serrated club, and it really looks like the samoan war club "Nifo Oti".

        Blade of mercy
        
        
        A special trick weapon passed down among hunters of hunters. One of the oldest weapons of the workshop. 
        Splits into two when activated. The weapon's warped blades are forged with siderite, a rare mineral of the heavens. Most effective swift attacks,such as after a quick-stepping."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers for 40000 echoes after obtaining the Crow Hunter Badge from Eileen the Crow's quest line.
        Killing Eileen is also a way to get the weapon early in the game.
        While progressing through Eileen's quest, it's possible for her to be killed by Henryk and thus drop the Crow Hunter Badge as a result, although the quest line will end.
        
        
        
        The Blade of Mercy was originally named as "Warped Twinblades" during the Alpha test, and it was the tool of choice for the "agile" hunter.
        Both the Burial Blade and Blade of Mercy make mentions of a mineral known as siderite in their descriptions.
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite, and it seems to be the reason why arcane power has direct scaling with both blade's damage output. Due to its extraterrestrial origins, that may explain why it cannot be buffed by an external source of any sort.
        It loosely resembles the Eleum Loyce from Dark Souls 2, a sword with two blades at the front.

        Bloodletter
        
        
        The demented hunter weapon brandished by Brador, the Healing Church assassin. 
        The Bloodletter assumes its true and terrifying form after it draws upon blood from the inner reaches of one's body and soul. 
        This is the only effective means of expelling tainted blood, or so Brador, isolated in his cell, continued to believe."
        
        
        
        Obtain the underground cell inner chamber key.
        Return to the underground prison (from the underground corpse pile lamp, go up the stairs and turn left) and open the door to Brador's cell. His cell is the second on the left behind a flight of downward stairs. Kill Brador to obtain the bloodletter.
        Brador will not be hostile in his cell, but will invade the player right outside his cell.

        Boom Hammer
        
        
        A trick weapon used by the old hunters, and crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. 
        A giant hammer equipped with a miniature furnace. When ignited and fired, it emits a volley of flame that explodes furiously upon impact. 
        Crush the beasts, then burn them - the brute simplicity of the Boom Hammer was favored by hunters with an acute distaste for beasts."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare. Inside a house that looks out of Central Yharnam, the same that is the shortcut to the cleric beast in the main game, where the 10 quicksilver bullets used to be. Be sure to shoot the explosives around the item (or act fast), as the wheelchair huntsman's corpse conceals a delayed molotov set to trigger when you try to grab the Boom Hammer, potential killing you in a huge blast.
        
        
        
        When the Boomhammer is lit, Beast Patient mobs will back away from the player as if they had a torch equipped. (May need to initiate primed attack first)

        Burial Blade
        
        
        Trick weapon wielded by Gehrman, the first hunter." 
        A masterpiece that defined the entire array of weapons crafted at the workshop. Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens. 
        Gehrman surely saw the hunt as a dirge of farewell, wishing only that his prey might rest in peace, never again to awaken to another harrowing nightmare. "
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 60,000 Blood Echoes after defeating Gehrman, the First Hunter and acquiring the Old Hunter Badge from him.
        To make Gehrman fight you, the "Refuse" option must be selected.
        If one accepts his proposal, the game will outright end there and it will be impossible to obtain this weapon in that playthrough (not including the uncanny/lost forms found in the chalice dungeons).
        Normally, the Burial Blade can only be obtained in NG+ and beyond. However, one can bypass this by using Bold Hunter's Mark, or being killed, during The Moon Presence boss battle.
        
        
        
         The Burial Blade was the first trick weapon ever created, and it inspired others to develop new trick weapons, usually on the premise of adapting to different combat scenerios.
        Not all weapons adapt to different combat scenerios (e.g. Tonitrus), but the Burial Blade still inspired an entire series of weapons that could "transform" to satisfy different purposes.
        It was created, and exclusively wielded, by Gehrman.
        A Burial Blade can be found above the workshop table in the Hunter's Dream.
        The weapon's description mentions that "Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens."
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite. Due to its extraterrestrial nature, it could be the reason why it has direct scaling with arcane and cannot be tampered by external sources.
        Both the Burial Blade and the Blade of Mercy mentions the use of it in their descriptions.
        Interestingly enough, these two weapons also resemble the talons of Mergo's Wet Nurse.
        The shape of the scythe highly resembles Rurufon's scythe from Shadow Tower Abyss, an early title created by From Software as well as being recurring weapons in Souls series.
        A strange bug on rare occurrences the cape on the hunter may come off, usually in a boss fight you could notice if you dodge back and do an R1 combo the cape disappears. [Note, I haven't seen this happen in a while, it's possible that it may have been fixed, but I'll need confirmation on this]

        Chikage
        
        
        Foreign-made weapon wielded by the royal guards who protect Annalise, Queen of the Vilebloods at Cainhurst Castle. 
        When the intricate, rippled engraving that spans the Chikage's blade is imbrued with blood, the sword sings in scarlet hues. 
        However, the rite eats away at the wielder's very essence."
        
        
        
        Join the Cainhurst Vilebloods covenant available at Cainhurst Castle, and then purchase from the Messengers for 50,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Chikage isn't actually a katana - it is a katana/european sword hybrid. Its short crossguard resembles the one of an early viking sword, or the one of a xiphos (greek sword). The closest european crossguard shape with  this sword is the one of a Karabela (a polish sabre). In other hand, the  hilt and pommel resemble the ones of a longsword (a bit longer, to get easier katana traditional jutsu swings), while the blade shape and the 2-handed fighting style is very similar to a katana. A possible explanation for the origin of this hybrid is that the katana's design was imported to Cainhurst, where some modifications were made to create a sword similar to that commonly used by their knights.
        The Chikage is an allusion to a particular 'breed' of Katanas in the Souls games. While it is similar to both the Hiltless and Chaos Blade from Demon's Souls and Dark Souls respectively, the Chikage bears a stronger resemblance to the Magic Sword "Makoto" (also from Demon's Souls). The Makoto is the only one the bunch to actually DRAIN the user's HP over time, rather than decrease it with each successful swing.
        Chikage (ÂçÉÊôØ) literally means "Thousands Views", however if you separated the word into Chi Kage (Ë°ÄÂΩ±), it means "Blood Shadow". This could be correlated to the fact that Shadows Of Yharnam wield a similar katana with a slight  crossguard, however without using the bloodtinge.
        The transforming attack has the hunter sheathe the Chikage before unleashing a strike. This is a reference to Iaijutsu, a traditional Japanese sword technique that focuses on quick-drawing. At its finest, Iaijutse allows the warrior to unsheathe and strike at incredible speeds.
        The name seems to be a tribute to Chikage Yamamura (mentioned as a "special thanks" in credits)
        The name may also be a reference to the work "1000 Plateaus" by Giles Deluze and Felix Guattari, a famous philosophical essay about fluidity and functionality, maybe dirrectly tied to the esoteric nature of the weapons function.

        Church Pick
        
        
        One of the old trick weapons of the Healing Church, a hunting weapon formed from one of the giant picks that appear in old beast tales. 
        The Church Pick initially serves as a large sword, but when transformed functions as an extended war pick. In spite of its origins, it is a highly practical weapon."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Dropped by a hunter wearing Yahar'Gul set (presumably, this is the summonable Old Hunter Defector Antal) in one of the cells that you open with the Underground Cell Key from the Research Hall. To make this battle simple, attack him through the door with a strong R2 attack, then leave the room. He will lose sight of you and his AI will return to a standstill behind the door. Rinse and repeat until dead.
        
        
        
        The Church Pick And The Hunter's Axe both have similar appearance. When transformed, both are wielded as a polearm and have the same de-transformation attack. The only difference apart from the Church Pick having a slightly more complicated mechanism is that the Hunter's Axe is a strength-based weapon.
        A few of its attacks in the transformed mode are very similar to that of the Burial Blade.

        Holy Moonlight Sword
        
        
        An arcane sword discovered long ago by Ludwig. 
        When blue moonlight dances around the sword, and it channels the abyssal cosmos, its great blade will hurl a shadowy lightwave. 
        The Holy Moonlight Sword is synonymous with Ludwig, the Holy Blade, but few have ever set eyes on the great blade, and whatever guidance it has to offer, it seems to be of a very private, elusive sort."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Found on the Underground Corpse Pile after the fight against Ludwig, The Holy Blade. Ludwig's head will be lying there and you can:
        Kill the head for the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and talk to the head. When prompted, reply "Yes" and you'll get the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and reply "No", then come back later and Simon the Harrowed will be there and give you the sword.
        NOTE: This weapon is missable. If Lawrence is killed before you obtain it, you will no longer be able to talk to the head or obtain it from Simon.
        
        
        
        It seems to be another reappearance of the Moonlight Greatsword, a recurring item found around FromSoftware's games. Notable examples of such games include the first, second and third Dark Souls games, Demon's Souls, King's Field, Ninja Blade, Enchanted Arms, Armored Core, 3D Dot Game Heroes, and Otogi.

Boasts a heavy blunt attack, leading to high rally potential. No matter their pasts, beasts are no more than beasts. Some choose this axe to play the part of executioner."
        
        
        
        It's possible to pick this trick weapon as a starting weapon near the beginning of Bloodborne.
        If not chosen, it can instead be purchased from the Messengers after the Hunter has found the Saw Hunter Badge.

        However, he has a moveset that is different from the Hunter's version.
        He is also capable of using his unique Hunter Pistol even while his Hunter Axe is transformed, which is impossible for the Hunter to do.
        It's also wielded by the Madara's Twin who drops Madara's Whistle when defeated.
        Another hostile hunter NPC wields this trick weapon in the Nightmare Frontier.
        It's been heavily debated by the fanbase whether the transformed mode is a halberd or poleaxe.
        Both forms utilized axe heads with a spear tip at the end (although some poleaxes used hammer heads instead).
        However, neither weapon was known to have extendable handles, which is a special trademark of the Hunter Axe.
        In either case, it's possible this trick weapon was inspired by both weapons and simply incorporated many different designs.
        While wielded in it's transformed mode if the player had a torch equipped in the off-hand beasts afraid of the fire will still recoil in fear of you as if you were brandishing the torch normally (Tested on Beast Patient)
        
        
    

        Simon's Bowblade
        
        
        Choice weapon of Simon, one of the first Healing Church hunters.
        Simon despised firearms, and so the Church workshop had this specially fashioned to his liking. The large curved blade serves as a bow when transformed.
        But aside from a few close friends, Simon was scoffed at for his choice of arms, for who would dare face the beasts with a measly bow?"

        Kirkhammer
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. On the one side, an easily handled silver sword. On the other, a giant obtuse stone weapon, characterized by a blunt strike and extreme force of impact. The Church takes a heavy-handed, merciless stance toward the plague of beasts, an irony not lost upon the wielders of this most symbolic weapon."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers after acquiring the Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        A miniature of the Kirkhammer was included as the Pre-Order Bonus for Asian editions of Bloodborne. [See the Bundles page for details]
        A "kirk" is an archaic old english word meaning "church."
        This means the weapon is literately known as the Church Hammer.
        The wording also might be a nod to Nordic culture since the word "Kirk" originated from northern England and Old Norse wording.
        The etched wording on the side of the hammer part has similarities to the Old Norse alphabet.
        However, it also has similarities to the Elder Futhark, one of the oldest forms of the runic alphabet system used by Germanic tribes.
        Similar etchings can be found on gravestones all over Yharnam.
        The sword used for this weapon is very similar to the one used for Ludwig's Holy Blade.
        This suggests that the Healing Church used the method of "interchangeable parts" to efficiently mass produce weapons for their hunters.
        However, the sword used for the Kirkhammer is shorter.
        It's wielded by Alfred, should you choose to be friends with him.
        He uses this weapon as a summon.
        However, he wields the Logarius' Wheel if you find him in Cainhurst Castle under special circumstances.
        When untransformed, with the hammer part on the character's back, some cloth parts (capes etc.) of the armor can either get awkwardly stuck on it or cover it.
        Despite being labeled a 'stone weapon', the etchings, wear, and sound produced when it strikes indicate that the hammer is in fact made of metal.

        Kos Parasite
        
        
        When the carcass of Kos washed up on the coast, its insides were teeming with tiny parasites, unlike any found in humans. 
        This atypical weapon can only be clasped tight and swung, but a Kos Parasite is said to stimulate phantasms inhabiting a lumenwood"
        
        
        
        Dropped by Orphan of Kos
        
        
        
        The Kos Parasite is perhaps the most interestingly unique weapon in Bloodborne in various ways: It is one of two weapons that can reach it's full potential while using a rune (the other being Beast Claw), the weapon itself is not held, it is purely an arcane weapon, it is the only weapon directly dropped by defeating a boss, it has the highest durability of any weapon at 600 respectively, it is the only weapon to have an A-scaling of any weapon without any upgrades and is the only weapon to have an S-scaling by upgrading it twice.

        Logarius's Wheel
        
        
        "Weapon wielded by martyr Logarius' band of executioners. 
        Used to slaughter the Vilebloods in Cainhurst. Bathed in pools of their blood, and forever steeped in their ire. 
        Transform to release the power of the wheel and manifest their lingering rage in a show of utter brilliance."
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 13,000 Blood Echoes after acquiring the Wheel Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        Alfred utilizes the Logarius' Wheel when found in Cainhurst Castle.
        This weapon is yet another reference to Berserk, as they are often made in Miyazaki's previous Souls games.
        "Logarius and his band of executioners" bear many similarities to Mozgus, an insanely devout man who traveled the land torturing heretics along with his disciples.
        The wheel in particular was wielded by one of his six disciples, .
        In Dark Souls, Bonewheel Skeletons are another reference to Mozgus' disciples.
        In real life, although wheels weren't typically wielded as weapons, they were commonly used as torture devices, especially during the Middle Ages.
        Torture wheels were nicknamed "breaking wheels," since victims often times would have their limbs broken during the process.
        They were also known as "catherine wheels."
         It's quite possible that Logarius' Wheel also takes some inspiration in its use as a weapon from the English folklore legend of Tom Hickathrift. Tom was a fabled giant killer who made use of a cartwheel to vanquish the Wisbech Giant (also referred to as an ogre).
        Lore theories can be found under "From Berserk to Bloodborne".

        Ludwig's Holy Blade
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. It is said that the silver sword was employed by Ludwig, the first hunter of the church. When transformed, it combines with its sheath to form a greatsword. 
        It exhibits several departures from the workshop's design, suggesting that the Church anticipated much larger inhuman beasts."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased for 20,000 echoes from the Messengers after obtaining the Radiant Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon was wielded by Ludwig, a famous hunter of the Healing Church who designed the blade based on the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        According to the description, Ludwig wielded this sword in combat instead of the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        However, in his boss fight, he wields the Holy Moonlight Sword during a certain part in the fight.
        It is possible that Ludwig wielded the Holy Moonlight Sword and his fellow hunters, inspired by the huge weapon, sought to make replicas. Unable to make a magic sword, a huge metal sheath was the compromise.
        Before the DLC's release, Ludwig's Holy Blade was thought of as From Software's traditional "Moonlight Greatsword" seen throughout various games by the fanbase.
        However, this sword was eventually revealed in the DLC to be a replica of the "true" Moonlight Greatsword in Bloodborne, the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        This isn't the first time Miyazaki used the name of classical music composers in a game.
        A boss from the first "Dark Souls" game, Dragonslayer Ornstein, is named after Leo Ornstein.
        Berlioz from "Armored Core 4" is named after Hector Berlioz.
        The normal form of this weapon is very similar to the sword used for the Kirkhammer.
        However, this sword's normal form has a slightly longer reach when compared to the Kirkhammer's blade.
        The similar nature of these swords suggests that the Healing Church used the method of interchangeable parts to quickly mass produce weapons for their hunters.

        Rakuyo
        
        
        Hunter weapon wielded by Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower. 
        A trick sword originated in the same country as the Cainhurst Chikage, only this sword feeds not off blood, but instead demands great dexterity. 
        Lady Maria was fond of this aspect of the Rakuyo, as she frowned upon blood blades, despite being a distant relative of the queen. 
        One day, she abandoned her beloved Rakuyo, casting it into a dark well, when she could stomach it no longer."
        
        
        
        Fishing Hamlet. Get to the bottom of the well. Can be reached from the underground tunnels at the end of the area or via a ladder in the well right away. In that area a Shark Giant will wander around. Fighting him makes a second one appear after the first reaches sufficiently low health. The first giant will walk over near the ladder and scream at the ceiling, causing the second one to drop. The second one drops the weapon.
        Fighting the two of them can be difficult and it is a good idea to use the Shaman Bone Blade to make them fight each other and finish off the weaker one. Molotov cocktails are also very effective against them. If neither is available to you, try to kill the one with the anchor first, as it is significantly harder to dodge.
        One easy way to beat them is use of ranged weapon like Simon's Bowblade if you are a bloodtinge build, and the Holy Moonlight Sword if you are an arcane build.
        A Threaded Cane's transformed whip can easily hit the giants from the ledge once they're lured over and begin attacking, but be sure to keep your distance after each hit. Except that there is no way to lure them over the the ledge. No ranged weapon will hit the one standing at the back and the one hanging from the ceiling doesn't drop down until the first one is at 50% health. 
        Unlike other giants in the game, these ones are easy to gun parry for a visceral attack. Keep in mind this will get very tricky after the other one starts fighting, so try to separate them and time your viscerals to get the invincibility at the right moment.
        If your range is inadequate you can use the monocular to angle a throwing knife to be able to hit the shark giant in the back. This way, you can continue from the strategy of killing them on the ledge with a gun/magic without going around. (confirmed as of January 19th, 2019)
        Chaining together backstabs is a very effecient way of dealing with them, if played right you should be able to eliminate the first shark giant before the second reaches you this way. It is extremely difficult to get behind the patrolling Shark Giant without him detecting you. 
        For a video showing an easy way to kill the sharks with a monocular and a throwing knife strategy, check .
        
        
        
        Rakuyo (ËêΩËëâ) literally means "falling leaf".
        The sword of Rakuyo bears resemblance to the "ky≈´ gunt≈ç", which was a hybrid of the sabre/katana with a handguard, used during the Russo-Japanese War.

        Reiterpallasch
        
        
        Weapon wielded by the Knights of Cainhurst. 
        Combines an elegant knight's sword with the peculiar firearm wielded by the Cainhurst order. 
        The old nobles, long-time imbibers of blood, are no strangers to the sanguine plague, and the disposal of beasts was a discrete task left to their servants, or knights, as they were called for the sake of appearances."
        
        
        
        It's found in a chest located in the entrance hall of Cainhurst Castle, where the Bound Widows are first encountered. When you first enter the room from the main entrance, run towards your two o'clock. The chest will be found in a corner.
        
        
        
        The Reiterpallasch (from German Reiter "horseback rider" and hungarian pallos [Ààp…ílo É] "sword") is a 17th century Hungarian straight sword with a typically double edged blade and guarded hilt that was used by Hungarian noble cavalry and later adapted by most western European armies.
        As pointed out in its description, the rifle spear is made "possibly in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon" (i.e. this one).
        Wynne D. Fanchon from Armored Core: For Answer; another From Software title, pilots a NEXT named Reiterpallasch.

        Rifle Spear
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. A prototype weapon serving as a simple firearm and spear, possibly created in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon. Lacks any notable functions, saving that it is the only trick weapon with an attached gun. "
        
        
        
        It can be found inside a hidden building in Old Yharnam. From the area you fight the first NPC Hunter (who wields a saw spear), drop down where the railing is missing in a corner and land on the ledges below. Go into the building and follow the stairs up; eventually you can find it stashed on a corpse tucked away in a hidden nook as you advance.
        Bought from the messengers for 4000 blood echoes after acquiring the Powder Keg Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        According to the Rifle Spear's description, it was designed as an imitation of "a lost Cainhurst weapon".
        That particular weapon may or may not be the Reiterpallasch.
        It should be noted these two weapons are the only two skill/firearm hybrids whose alternate forms utilize guns.
        The third skill/firearm hybrid weapon in this game is Simon's Bowblade, which transforms from a sword into a bow.
        The Rifle Spear is carried by a Yahar'Gul Hunter in the Cathedral Ward.
        This fight can be tricky because you first encounter a Yahar'Gul Hunter that uses a Tonitrus near the base of the stairs, and if you advance too far towards the houses, the Rifle Spear Yahar'Gul Hunter will join the fight as well.
        He also uses Ludwig's Rifle, meaning he can hit you from a considerable distance with shotgun pellets no matter what mode he uses for the Rifle Spear.

        Saw Cleaver
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used in the hunting business. 
        This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts, transforms into a long cleaver that makes use of centrifugal force. 
        The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness the more grotesquely transformed the beast."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired as a gift from the Messengers the first time you visit the Hunter's Dream.
        If you don't select it, you may buy it after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne.)
        
        
        
        The Saw Cleaver is the Trick Weapon featured on the title screen.
        It was also one of the first weapons to be revealed for this game.
        Overall the mechanisms of this weapon didn't change at all, starting all the way back when Bloodborne was still known as "Project Beast."
        According to the concept art, the Saw Cleaver uses a trigger mechanism to unlock the joint during transformation.
        The design of the Saw Cleaver seems to be inspired by multiple references:
        The transformed cleaver shows a resemblance to LB-66 MOONLIGHT from Armored Core V.
        The Japanese name is written as "nokogiri nata" („Éé„Ç≥„ÇÆ„É™Èâà) or "saw hatchet". Nokogiri is a traditional Japanese saw that cuts from the pull stroke, as opposed to the more common push stroke.
        In real life, there is a type of cleaver known as a mezzaluna ("half moon") cleaver, known for chopping/mincing up various food products.
        Most of these types of cleavers have handles on both ends.
        However, some use a single handle that stretches across the blade, which was used to chop up herbs usually; the saw cleaver follows this particular model.
        Coincidentally, the Strength/Skill/Arcane scaling at maximum level is "CDC" in their respective order.
        The CDC is an American organization designed to combat and prevent "health threats" of varying natures.
        Since the beast scourge acts like a plague (and is spread due to blood-related reasons), those who wield the Saw Cleaver can be thought of as fighting a dangerous epidemic.
        Henryk uses this weapon when he fights you and Eileen the Crow during her questline, as well as when he is summoned by you when using the Old Hunter Bell.

        Saw Spear
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used by those who dedicate themselves to the hunt. This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts, transforms into a medium-range spear. The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness the more grotesquely transformed the beast."
        
        
        
        Can be bought from the Bath Messengers, after obtaining the Saw Hunter Badge, for 1,000 Blood Echoes.

        Stake Driver
        
        
        A trick weapon fashioned by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. Favored by the retired hunter Djura. 
        The stake driver, with its queerly complex design, violently drives thick stakes into the flesh of foes. 
        The stake driver allows for high-damage critical attacks, but is difficult to use and leaves its wielder wide open, but none of this should bother a mere Powder Keg."
        
        
        
        Obtain Powder Keg Hunter Badge to unlock for purchase at the Messengers for 8,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Stake Driver is exclusively wielded by Djura when he is still hostile towards you.
        His fight is tricky because the area around him is very limited, meaning you can fall to your death if you're not careful.
        Furthermore, the limited space is perfect for his choice of weapon which has a short range.
        This is modeled after the "Pile Bunker," a type of fictional weaponry which launches piston with gunpowder or explosion.
        In the Japanese version of Bloodborne, this weapon is literally called the Pile Hammer („Éë„Ç§„É´„Éè„É≥„Éû„Éº).
        It bears a striking resemblance to the "Parrying Blade" weapons seen in several "Armored Core" games.
        Has the highest charged attack multiplier out of any other weapon.

        Threaded Cane
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used by hunters on their duties. Sufficiently deadly as a rigid bladed cane, but also serves as a whip when its blade is split into many. Concealing the weapon inside the cane and flogging the beasts with the whip is partly an act of ceremony, an attempt to demonstrate to oneself that the bloodlust of the hunt will never encroach upon the soul."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired at the beginning of the game as a gift from the Messengers.
        If not selected, it is later available for purchase from the blood fountain messengers after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne).
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is used by Iosefka, Last Scholar Yurie and the Frontier Church Hunter.
        Gehrman carries a generic cane in the Workshop instead of the Threaded Cane.
        This trick weapon is possibly inspired by the sword used by Jean-Fran√ßois de Morangias in the climactic battle of French action-horror film Brotherhood of the Wolf (which bears many other similarities to Bloodborne), or the sword used by a bandit leader in the anime/manga series Claymore. Both these weapons act as a straight, double-edged sword that can transform into a segmented, bladed whip.

        Tonitrus
        
        
        "A unique trick weapon contrived by Archibald, the infamous eccentric of the Healing Church workshop. 
        Striking this peculiar iron morning star flail like a match generates the same blue sparks that blanket a darkbeast. 
        Unfortunately, for reasons untold, the hunters of Archibald's time did not fully take to the device."
        
        
        
        Acquire the Spark Hunter Badge by defeating Darkbeast Paarl  to purchase from Messengers.
        Treasure: Yahar'gul, Unseen Village, at the top end of the road. (guarded by 2 Tainted Dogs and a Snatcher during daytime)
        
        
        
        Tonitrus is a Latin word meaning "thunder."
        The in-game description classifies this trick weapon as a morning star flail, but it's actually modeled in the form of a mace.
        The description of Archibald bears many similarities to Nikola Tesla, a famed inventor in real life who specialized in the field of electricity.
        Nikola Tesla created the Tesla Coil, a device that also bears many similarities to the Tonitrus.
        The Tonitrus also bears similarities with the aspergillum, a device used by the Roman Catholic Church to sprinkle holy water.
        According to the description of the Spark Hunter Badge, Archibald was associated with the Healing Church.
        In this sense, it may have been designed under the themes of "purificiation" and "cleansing" that is associated with many Healing Church trick weapons/tools.
        However, due to Archibald's fascination with Dark Beasts, it's more likely he designed the Tonitrus as a measure to replicate the sparks these creatures could unleash.

        Whirligig Saw
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs, and weapon of choice of the Old Hunter Valtr, the Beast Eater. 
        This weapon pummels beasts in its mace form, but its true strength lies in its attached mechanical saws. 
        These discs, lined with serrated teeth,spin rapidly, thrashing the flesh of beasts into fine shreds."
        
        
        
        From the Nightmare Church go down the stairs and follow the path. Drop down into the pools of blood of follow the path further until you reach the Cannon Executioner. Follow the left wall and turn down the path, the weapon is at the end.
        
        
        
        If you use the L2 buzzsaw attack against Orphan of Kos and hold it in place, it attempts to make an immediate counterattack for each time it gets hit by the whirring blades, only to get interrupted by the next hit. It shrieks every time it attacks, so as a result, it lets loose dozens of overlapping shriek sound effects for as long as you hold it in place.
        A whirligig is defined as a toy that is constantly spinning, such as a top or pinwheel, or as something regarded as hectic and constantly changing.
        Similar to most Powder Keg weapons sharing homage to Armored Core weapons, the Whirligig Saw is based on the Grind Blade.

        Amygdalan Arm 
        
        
        The arm of a small Amygdala Great One. 
        Strictly speaking, the Amygdalan Arm is no trick weapon of any sort, but certain madmen wield them like clubs. 
        Starts as a large, tough blunt weapon formed of bone, but when extended, the hand quivers as if it were still alive.
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare, cave at the end of the blood river to the right after getting out of the building that used to be the shortcut to the Cleric Beast in the main game. Gatling Gun Hunter dropping the Gatling Gun and a Blood-Starved Beast can be also found here. Arm is near the Blood-Starved Beast at the end of the cave.
        
        
        
        The Amygdalan Arm is a Trick Weapon in name only, considering that it is an arm obtained from Amygdala.
        The arm is remarkably small, as even the Lesser Amygdalae are huge. Perhaps it came from a newborn Amygdala.
        The arm could be the inspiration behind the Burial Blade.

        Beastly weapon wielded by Irreverent Izzy.
        Crafted by chiseling the long bones of an undead darkbeast and fastening them to the weapon. The bones are still alive, and when unleashed, grant its wielder a spurt of beastly power. 
        As flesh is flayed and blood is sprayed, the beast within awakens, and in time, the wielder of this weapon surges with both strength and feverish reverie."
        
        
        
        Ailing Loran Chalice: Layer 2 treasure room. Room is on the right when exiting the elevator from first layer boss fight, before the second layers lantern.
        Can be bought from messengers for 34000 echoes after acquisition.
        Can be bought from messengers after co-operation with player who has them. This only occurs in Hunter's dream before fight with Gehrman or Moon Presence. It is not needed to complete any Chalice Dungeons. It is unknown if this is glitch or intentional. Was patched by 1.07 or 1.08.
        
        
        
        When this weapon is equipped, your gloves will be replaced by two bone gauntlets. This can allow for the lost art of rapid glove changing if you switch your weapons really fast.
        You can charge the beasthood meter on the first windows (Gilbert) of Central Yharnam
        In the past, there was a rare glitch that allowed a player to obtain this weapon without finding it in the Chalice Dungeons.

        Although this trick weapon allows for adaptive combat, it was later replaced by saws and similar weapons that were more effective at disposing of beasts."

        A trick weapon used by Old Hunters. 
        This thick iron cleaver slices through the toughest of beast hides, and when transformed the blade splits into sections, allowing one to lash it in the fashion of a heavy whip. 
        This crude weapon relies on brute force and is regrettably inelegant, suggesting that the hunts of the earliest hunters made for horrific affairs, painted in sanguine black and reds."
        
        
        
        When walking up the stairs to the nightmare version of the Grand Cathedral, turn left onto a small platform, then roll off and walk down some rough terrain to find the weapon on a corpse.
        
        
        
        Reminds many of the Zanpakut≈ç , a fictional segmented sword that can function as a whip. It is an iconic weapon from the Bleach anime.
        The untransformed form of the weapon is a cleaver-like serrated club, and it really looks like the samoan war club "Nifo Oti".

        Blade of mercy
        
        
        A special trick weapon passed down among hunters of hunters. One of the oldest weapons of the workshop. 
        Splits into two when activated. The weapon's warped blades are forged with siderite, a rare mineral of the heavens. Most effective swift attacks,such as after a quick-stepping."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers for 40000 echoes after obtaining the Crow Hunter Badge from Eileen the Crow's quest line.
        Killing Eileen is also a way to get the weapon early in the game.
        While progressing through Eileen's quest, it's possible for her to be killed by Henryk and thus drop the Crow Hunter Badge as a result, although the quest line will end.
        
        
        
        The Blade of Mercy was originally named as "Warped Twinblades" during the Alpha test, and it was the tool of choice for the "agile" hunter.
        Both the Burial Blade and Blade of Mercy make mentions of a mineral known as siderite in their descriptions.
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite, and it seems to be the reason why arcane power has direct scaling with both blade's damage output. Due to its extraterrestrial origins, that may explain why it cannot be buffed by an external source of any sort.
        It loosely resembles the Eleum Loyce from Dark Souls 2, a sword with two blades at the front.

        Bloodletter
        
        
        The demented hunter weapon brandished by Brador, the Healing Church assassin. 
        The Bloodletter assumes its true and terrifying form after it draws upon blood from the inner reaches of one's body and soul. 
        This is the only effective means of expelling tainted blood, or so Brador, isolated in his cell, continued to believe."
        
        
        
        Obtain the underground cell inner chamber key.
        Return to the underground prison (from the underground corpse pile lamp, go up the stairs and turn left) and open the door to Brador's cell. His cell is the second on the left behind a flight of downward stairs. Kill Brador to obtain the bloodletter.
        Brador will not be hostile in his cell, but will invade the player right outside his cell.

        Boom Hammer
        
        
        A trick weapon used by the old hunters, and crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. 
        A giant hammer equipped with a miniature furnace. When ignited and fired, it emits a volley of flame that explodes furiously upon impact. 
        Crush the beasts, then burn them - the brute simplicity of the Boom Hammer was favored by hunters with an acute distaste for beasts."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare. Inside a house that looks out of Central Yharnam, the same that is the shortcut to the cleric beast in the main game, where the 10 quicksilver bullets used to be. Be sure to shoot the explosives around the item (or act fast), as the wheelchair huntsman's corpse conceals a delayed molotov set to trigger when you try to grab the Boom Hammer, potential killing you in a huge blast.
        
        
        
        When the Boomhammer is lit, Beast Patient mobs will back away from the player as if they had a torch equipped. (May need to initiate primed attack first)

        Burial Blade
        
        
        Trick weapon wielded by Gehrman, the first hunter." 
        A masterpiece that defined the entire array of weapons crafted at the workshop. Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens. 
        Gehrman surely saw the hunt as a dirge of farewell, wishing only that his prey might rest in peace, never again to awaken to another harrowing nightmare. "
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 60,000 Blood Echoes after defeating Gehrman, the First Hunter and acquiring the Old Hunter Badge from him.
        To make Gehrman fight you, the "Refuse" option must be selected.
        If one accepts his proposal, the game will outright end there and it will be impossible to obtain this weapon in that playthrough (not including the uncanny/lost forms found in the chalice dungeons).
        Normally, the Burial Blade can only be obtained in NG+ and beyond. However, one can bypass this by using Bold Hunter's Mark, or being killed, during The Moon Presence boss battle.
        
        
        
         The Burial Blade was the first trick weapon ever created, and it inspired others to develop new trick weapons, usually on the premise of adapting to different combat scenerios.
        Not all weapons adapt to different combat scenerios (e.g. Tonitrus), but the Burial Blade still inspired an entire series of weapons that could "transform" to satisfy different purposes.
        It was created, and exclusively wielded, by Gehrman.
        A Burial Blade can be found above the workshop table in the Hunter's Dream.
        The weapon's description mentions that "Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens."
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite. Due to its extraterrestrial nature, it could be the reason why it has direct scaling with arcane and cannot be tampered by external sources.
        Both the Burial Blade and the Blade of Mercy mentions the use of it in their descriptions.
        Interestingly enough, these two weapons also resemble the talons of Mergo's Wet Nurse.
        The shape of the scythe highly resembles Rurufon's scythe from Shadow Tower Abyss, an early title created by From Software as well as being recurring weapons in Souls series.
        A strange bug on rare occurrences the cape on the hunter may come off, usually in a boss fight you could notice if you dodge back and do an R1 combo the cape disappears. [Note, I haven't seen this happen in a while, it's possible that it may have been fixed, but I'll need confirmation on this]

        Chikage
        
        
        Foreign-made weapon wielded by the royal guards who protect Annalise, Queen of the Vilebloods at Cainhurst Castle. 
        When the intricate, rippled engraving that spans the Chikage's blade is imbrued with blood, the sword sings in scarlet hues. 
        However, the rite eats away at the wielder's very essence."
        
        
        
        Join the Cainhurst Vilebloods covenant available at Cainhurst Castle, and then purchase from the Messengers for 50,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Chikage isn't actually a katana - it is a katana/european sword hybrid. Its short crossguard resembles the one of an early viking sword, or the one of a xiphos (greek sword). The closest european crossguard shape with  this sword is the one of a Karabela (a polish sabre). In other hand, the  hilt and pommel resemble the ones of a longsword (a bit longer, to get easier katana traditional jutsu swings), while the blade shape and the 2-handed fighting style is very similar to a katana. A possible explanation for the origin of this hybrid is that the katana's design was imported to Cainhurst, where some modifications were made to create a sword similar to that commonly used by their knights.
        The Chikage is an allusion to a particular 'breed' of Katanas in the Souls games. While it is similar to both the Hiltless and Chaos Blade from Demon's Souls and Dark Souls respectively, the Chikage bears a stronger resemblance to the Magic Sword "Makoto" (also from Demon's Souls). The Makoto is the only one the bunch to actually DRAIN the user's HP over time, rather than decrease it with each successful swing.
        Chikage (ÂçÉÊôØ) literally means "Thousands Views", however if you separated the word into Chi Kage (Ë°ÄÂΩ±), it means "Blood Shadow". This could be correlated to the fact that Shadows Of Yharnam wield a similar katana with a slight  crossguard, however without using the bloodtinge.
        The transforming attack has the hunter sheathe the Chikage before unleashing a strike. This is a reference to Iaijutsu, a traditional Japanese sword technique that focuses on quick-drawing. At its finest, Iaijutse allows the warrior to unsheathe and strike at incredible speeds.
        The name seems to be a tribute to Chikage Yamamura (mentioned as a "special thanks" in credits)
        The name may also be a reference to the work "1000 Plateaus" by Giles Deluze and Felix Guattari, a famous philosophical essay about fluidity and functionality, maybe dirrectly tied to the esoteric nature of the weapons function.

        Church Pick
        
        
        One of the old trick weapons of the Healing Church, a hunting weapon formed from one of the giant picks that appear in old beast tales. 
        The Church Pick initially serves as a large sword, but when transformed functions as an extended war pick. In spite of its origins, it is a highly practical weapon."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Dropped by a hunter wearing Yahar'Gul set (presumably, this is the summonable Old Hunter Defector Antal) in one of the cells that you open with the Underground Cell Key from the Research Hall. To make this battle simple, attack him through the door with a strong R2 attack, then leave the room. He will lose sight of you and his AI will return to a standstill behind the door. Rinse and repeat until dead.
        
        
        
        The Church Pick And The Hunter's Axe both have similar appearance. When transformed, both are wielded as a polearm and have the same de-transformation attack. The only difference apart from the Church Pick having a slightly more complicated mechanism is that the Hunter's Axe is a strength-based weapon.
        A few of its attacks in the transformed mode are very similar to that of the Burial Blade.

        Holy Moonlight Sword
        
        
        An arcane sword discovered long ago by Ludwig. 
        When blue moonlight dances around the sword, and it channels the abyssal cosmos, its great blade will hurl a shadowy lightwave. 
        The Holy Moonlight Sword is synonymous with Ludwig, the Holy Blade, but few have ever set eyes on the great blade, and whatever guidance it has to offer, it seems to be of a very private, elusive sort."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Found on the Underground Corpse Pile after the fight against Ludwig, The Holy Blade. Ludwig's head will be lying there and you can:
        Kill the head for the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and talk to the head. When prompted, reply "Yes" and you'll get the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and reply "No", then come back later and Simon the Harrowed will be there and give you the sword.
        NOTE: This weapon is missable. If Lawrence is killed before you obtain it, you will no longer be able to talk to the head or obtain it from Simon.
        
        
        
        It seems to be another reappearance of the Moonlight Greatsword, a recurring item found around FromSoftware's games. Notable examples of such games include the first, second and third Dark Souls games, Demon's Souls, King's Field, Ninja Blade, Enchanted Arms, Armored Core, 3D Dot Game Heroes, and Otogi.

        Hunter Axe
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used on the hunt. Retains the qualities of an axe, but offers a wider palette of attacks by transforming. Boasts a heavy blunt attack, leading to high rally potential. No matter their pasts, beasts are no more than beasts. Some choose this axe to play the part of executioner."
        
        
        
        It's possible to pick this trick weapon as a starting weapon near the beginning of Bloodborne.
        If not chosen, it can instead be purchased from the Messengers after the Hunter has found the Saw Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is wielded by Father Gascoigne.
        However, he has a moveset that is different from the Hunter's version.
        He is also capable of using his unique Hunter Pistol even while his Hunter Axe is transformed, which is impossible for the Hunter to do.
        It's also wielded by the Madara's Twin who drops Madara's Whistle when defeated.
        Another hostile hunter NPC wields this trick weapon in the Nightmare Frontier.
        It's been heavily debated by the fanbase whether the transformed mode is a halberd or poleaxe.
        Both forms utilized axe heads with a spear tip at the end (although some poleaxes used hammer heads instead).
        However, neither weapon was known to have extendable handles, which is a special trademark of the Hunter Axe.
        In either case, it's possible this trick weapon was inspired by both weapons and simply incorporated many different designs.
        While wielded in it's transformed mode if the player had a torch equipped in the off-hand beasts afraid of the fire will still recoil in fear of you as if you were brandishing the torch normally (Tested on Beast Patient)

        Kirkhammer
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. On the one side, an easily handled silver sword. On the other, a giant obtuse stone weapon, characterized by a blunt strike and extreme force of impact. The Church takes a heavy-handed, merciless stance toward the plague of beasts, an irony not lost upon the wielders of this most symbolic weapon."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers after acquiring the Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        A miniature of the Kirkhammer was included as the Pre-Order Bonus for Asian editions of Bloodborne. [See the Bundles page for details]
        A "kirk" is an archaic old english word meaning "church."
        This means the weapon is literately known as the Church Hammer.
        The wording also might be a nod to Nordic culture since the word "Kirk" originated from northern England and Old Norse wording.
        The etched wording on the side of the hammer part has similarities to the Old Norse alphabet.
        However, it also has similarities to the Elder Futhark, one of the oldest forms of the runic alphabet system used by Germanic tribes.
        Similar etchings can be found on gravestones all over Yharnam.
        The sword used for this weapon is very similar to the one used for Ludwig's Holy Blade.
        This suggests that the Healing Church used the method of "interchangeable parts" to efficiently mass produce weapons for their hunters.
        However, the sword used for the Kirkhammer is shorter.
        It's wielded by Alfred, should you choose to be friends with him.
        He uses this weapon as a summon.
        However, he wields the Logarius' Wheel if you find him in Cainhurst Castle under special circumstances.
        When untransformed, with the hammer part on the character's back, some cloth parts (capes etc.) of the armor can either get awkwardly stuck on it or cover it.
        Despite being labeled a 'stone weapon', the etchings, wear, and sound produced when it strikes indicate that the hammer is in fact made of metal.

        Kos Parasite
        
        
        When the carcass of Kos washed up on the coast, its insides were teeming with tiny parasites, unlike any found in humans. 
        This atypical weapon can only be clasped tight and swung, but a Kos Parasite is said to stimulate phantasms inhabiting a lumenwood"
        
        
        
        Dropped by Orphan of Kos
        
        
        
        The Kos Parasite is perhaps the most interestingly unique weapon in Bloodborne in various ways: It is one of two weapons that can reach it's full potential while using a rune (the other being Beast Claw), the weapon itself is not held, it is purely an arcane weapon, it is the only weapon directly dropped by defeating a boss, it has the highest durability of any weapon at 600 respectively, it is the only weapon to have an A-scaling of any weapon without any upgrades and is the only weapon to have an S-scaling by upgrading it twice.

        Logarius's Wheel
        
        
        "Weapon wielded by martyr Logarius' band of executioners. 
        Used to slaughter the Vilebloods in Cainhurst. Bathed in pools of their blood, and forever steeped in their ire. 
        Transform to release the power of the wheel and manifest their lingering rage in a show of utter brilliance."
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 13,000 Blood Echoes after acquiring the Wheel Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        Alfred utilizes the Logarius' Wheel when found in Cainhurst Castle.
        This weapon is yet another reference to Berserk, as they are often made in Miyazaki's previous Souls games.
        "Logarius and his band of executioners" bear many similarities to Mozgus, an insanely devout man who traveled the land torturing heretics along with his disciples.
        The wheel in particular was wielded by one of his six disciples, .
        In Dark Souls, Bonewheel Skeletons are another reference to Mozgus' disciples.
        In real life, although wheels weren't typically wielded as weapons, they were commonly used as torture devices, especially during the Middle Ages.
        Torture wheels were nicknamed "breaking wheels," since victims often times would have their limbs broken during the process.
        They were also known as "catherine wheels."
         It's quite possible that Logarius' Wheel also takes some inspiration in its use as a weapon from the English folklore legend of Tom Hickathrift. Tom was a fabled giant killer who made use of a cartwheel to vanquish the Wisbech Giant (also referred to as an ogre).
        Lore theories can be found under "From Berserk to Bloodborne".

        Ludwig's Holy Blade
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. It is said that the silver sword was employed by Ludwig, the first hunter of the church. When transformed, it combines with its sheath to form a greatsword. 
        It exhibits several departures from the workshop's design, suggesting that the Church anticipated much larger inhuman beasts."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased for 20,000 echoes from the Messengers after obtaining the Radiant Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon was wielded by Ludwig, a famous hunter of the Healing Church who designed the blade based on the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        According to the description, Ludwig wielded this sword in combat instead of the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        However, in his boss fight, he wields the Holy Moonlight Sword during a certain part in the fight.
        It is possible that Ludwig wielded the Holy Moonlight Sword and his fellow hunters, inspired by the huge weapon, sought to make replicas. Unable to make a magic sword, a huge metal sheath was the compromise.
        Before the DLC's release, Ludwig's Holy Blade was thought of as From Software's traditional "Moonlight Greatsword" seen throughout various games by the fanbase.
        However, this sword was eventually revealed in the DLC to be a replica of the "true" Moonlight Greatsword in Bloodborne, the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        This isn't the first time Miyazaki used the name of classical music composers in a game.
        A boss from the first "Dark Souls" game, Dragonslayer Ornstein, is named after Leo Ornstein.
        Berlioz from "Armored Core 4" is named after Hector Berlioz.
        The normal form of this weapon is very similar to the sword used for the Kirkhammer.
        However, this sword's normal form has a slightly longer reach when compared to the Kirkhammer's blade.
        The similar nature of these swords suggests that the Healing Church used the method of interchangeable parts to quickly mass produce weapons for their hunters.
        Lore theories exist under Ebrietas Lore.

        Rakuyo
        
        
        Hunter weapon wielded by Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower. 
        A trick sword originated in the same country as the Cainhurst Chikage, only this sword feeds not off blood, but instead demands great dexterity. 
        Lady Maria was fond of this aspect of the Rakuyo, as she frowned upon blood blades, despite being a distant relative of the queen. 
        One day, she abandoned her beloved Rakuyo, casting it into a dark well, when she could stomach it no longer."
        
        
        
        Fishing Hamlet. Get to the bottom of the well. Can be reached from the underground tunnels at the end of the area or via a ladder in the well right away. In that area a Shark Giant will wander around. Fighting him makes a second one appear after the first reaches sufficiently low health. The first giant will walk over near the ladder and scream at the ceiling, causing the second one to drop. The second one drops the weapon.
        Fighting the two of them can be difficult and it is a good idea to use the Shaman Bone Blade to make them fight each other and finish off the weaker one. Molotov cocktails are also very effective against them. If neither is available to you, try to kill the one with the anchor first, as it is significantly harder to dodge.
        One easy way to beat them is use of ranged weapon like Simon's Bowblade if you are a bloodtinge build, and the Holy Moonlight Sword if you are an arcane build.
        A Threaded Cane's transformed whip can easily hit the giants from the ledge once they're lured over and begin attacking, but be sure to keep your distance after each hit. Except that there is no way to lure them over the the ledge. No ranged weapon will hit the one standing at the back and the one hanging from the ceiling doesn't drop down until the first one is at 50% health. 
        Unlike other giants in the game, these ones are easy to gun parry for a visceral attack. Keep in mind this will get very tricky after the other one starts fighting, so try to separate them and time your viscerals to get the invincibility at the right moment.
        If your range is inadequate you can use the monocular to angle a throwing knife to be able to hit the shark giant in the back. This way, you can continue from the strategy of killing them on the ledge with a gun/magic without going around. (confirmed as of January 19th, 2019)
        Chaining together backstabs is a very effecient way of dealing with them, if played right you should be able to eliminate the first shark giant before the second reaches you this way. It is extremely difficult to get behind the patrolling Shark Giant without him detecting you. 
        For a video showing an easy way to kill the sharks with a monocular and a throwing knife strategy, check .
        
        
        
        Rakuyo (ËêΩËëâ) literally means "falling leaf".
        The sword of Rakuyo bears resemblance to the "ky≈´ gunt≈ç", which was a hybrid of the sabre/katana with a handguard, used during the Russo-Japanese War.

        Reiterpallasch
        
        
        Weapon wielded by the Knights of Cainhurst. 
        Combines an elegant knight's sword with the peculiar firearm wielded by the Cainhurst order. 
        The old nobles, long-time imbibers of blood, are no strangers to the sanguine plague, and the disposal of beasts was a discrete task left to their servants, or knights, as they were called for the sake of appearances."
        
        
        
        It's found in a chest located in the entrance hall of Cainhurst Castle, where the Bound Widows are first encountered. When you first enter the room from the main entrance, run towards your two o'clock. The chest will be found in a corner.
        
        
        
        The Reiterpallasch (from German Reiter "horseback rider" and hungarian pallos [Ààp…ílo É] "sword") is a 17th century Hungarian straight sword with a typically double edged blade and guarded hilt that was used by Hungarian noble cavalry and later adapted by most western European armies.
        As pointed out in its description, the rifle spear is made "possibly in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon" (i.e. this one).
        Wynne D. Fanchon from Armored Core: For Answer; another From Software title, pilots a NEXT named Reiterpallasch.

        Rifle Spear
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. A prototype weapon serving as a simple firearm and spear, possibly created in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon. Lacks any notable functions, saving that it is the only trick weapon with an attached gun. "
        
        
        
        It can be found inside a hidden building in Old Yharnam. From the area you fight the first NPC Hunter (who wields a saw spear), drop down where the railing is missing in a corner and land on the ledges below. Go into the building and follow the stairs up; eventually you can find it stashed on a corpse tucked away in a hidden nook as you advance.
        Bought from the messengers for 4000 blood echoes after acquiring the Powder Keg Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        According to the Rifle Spear's description, it was designed as an imitation of "a lost Cainhurst weapon".
        That particular weapon may or may not be the Reiterpallasch.
        It should be noted these two weapons are the only two skill/firearm hybrids whose alternate forms utilize guns.
        The third skill/firearm hybrid weapon in this game is Simon's Bowblade, which transforms from a sword into a bow.
        The Rifle Spear is carried by a Yahar'Gul Hunter in the Cathedral Ward.
        This fight can be tricky because you first encounter a Yahar'Gul Hunter that uses a Tonitrus near the base of the stairs, and if you advance too far towards the houses, the Rifle Spear Yahar'Gul Hunter will join the fight as well.
        He also uses Ludwig's Rifle, meaning he can hit you from a considerable distance with shotgun pellets no matter what mode he uses for the Rifle Spear.

        Overall the mechanisms of this weapon didn't change at all, starting all the way back when Bloodborne was still known as "Project Beast."
        According to the concept art, the Saw Cleaver uses a trigger mechanism to unlock the joint during transformation.
        The design of the Saw Cleaver seems to be inspired by multiple references:
        The transformed cleaver shows a resemblance to LB-66 MOONLIGHT from Armored Core V.
        The Japanese name is written as "nokogiri nata" („Éé„Ç≥„ÇÆ„É™Èâà) or "saw hatchet". Nokogiri is a traditional Japanese saw that cuts from the pull stroke, as opposed to the more common push stroke.
        In real life, there is a type of cleaver known as a mezzaluna ("half moon") cleaver, known for chopping/mincing up various food products.
        Most of these types of cleavers have handles on both ends.
        However, some use a single handle that stretches across the blade, which was used to chop up herbs usually; the saw cleaver follows this particular model.
        Coincidentally, the Strength/Skill/Arcane scaling at maximum level is "CDC" in their respective order.
        The CDC is an American organization designed to combat and prevent "health threats" of varying natures.
        Since the beast scourge acts like a plague (and is spread due to blood-related reasons), those who wield the Saw Cleaver can be thought of as fighting a dangerous epidemic.
        Henryk uses this weapon when he fights you and Eileen the Crow during her questline, as well as when he is summoned by you when using the Old Hunter Bell.
        
        
    

        Stake Driver
        
        
        A trick weapon fashioned by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. Favored by the retired hunter Djura. 
        The stake driver, with its queerly complex design, violently drives thick stakes into the flesh of foes. 
        The stake driver allows for high-damage critical attacks, but is difficult to use and leaves its wielder wide open, but none of this should bother a mere Powder Keg."
        
        
        
        Obtain Powder Keg Hunter Badge to unlock for purchase at the Messengers for 8,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Stake Driver is exclusively wielded by Djura when he is still hostile towards you.
        His fight is tricky because the area around him is very limited, meaning you can fall to your death if you're not careful.
        Furthermore, the limited space is perfect for his choice of weapon which has a short range.
        This is modeled after the "Pile Bunker," a type of fictional weaponry which launches piston with gunpowder or explosion.
        In the Japanese version of Bloodborne, this weapon is literally called the Pile Hammer („Éë„Ç§„É´„Éè„É≥„Éû„Éº).
        It bears a striking resemblance to the "Parrying Blade" weapons seen in several "Armored Core" games.
        Has the highest charged attack multiplier out of any other weapon.

        Saw Spear
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used by those who dedicate themselves to the hunt. This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts, transforms into a medium-range spear. The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness the more grotesquely transformed the beast."
        
        
        
        Can be bought from the Bath Messengers, after obtaining the Saw Hunter Badge, for 1,000 Blood Echoes.
        Treasure in Central Yharnam Sewer, on the ledge above the dead end with boats. You also need to cut down the corpse hanging from the rafters high above.
        
        
        
        Carried by Djura's Ally in Old Yharnam.

        Simon's Bowblade
        
        
        Choice weapon of Simon, one of the first Healing Church hunters.
        Simon despised firearms, and so the Church workshop had this specially fashioned to his liking. The large curved blade serves as a bow when transformed.
        But aside from a few close friends, Simon was scoffed at for his choice of arms, for who would dare face the beasts with a measly bow?"
        
        
        
        Fishing Hamlet: Found on the body of Simon the Harrowed next to the Lighthouse Hut lantern after answering the first option at the Hunter's Nightmare shortcut and going through his quest-line. Interact with him as he lies on the ground to obtain the weapon.
        You may also kill Simon the Harrowed at The Hunter's Nightmare or Research Hall to obtain the weapon.
        
        
        
        Simon's Bowblade is the only weapon to have a S-scaling for two attributes (Skill and Bloodtinge respectively) when fully upgraded

        Threaded Cane
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used by hunters on their duties. Sufficiently deadly as a rigid bladed cane, but also serves as a whip when its blade is split into many. Concealing the weapon inside the cane and flogging the beasts with the whip is partly an act of ceremony, an attempt to demonstrate to oneself that the bloodlust of the hunt will never encroach upon the soul."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired at the beginning of the game as a gift from the Messengers.
        If not selected, it is later available for purchase from the blood fountain messengers after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne).
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is used by Iosefka, Last Scholar Yurie and the Frontier Church Hunter.
        Gehrman carries a generic cane in the Workshop instead of the Threaded Cane.
        This trick weapon is possibly inspired by the sword used by Jean-Fran√ßois de Morangias in the climactic battle of French action-horror film Brotherhood of the Wolf (which bears many other similarities to Bloodborne), or the sword used by a bandit leader in the anime/manga series Claymore. Both these weapons act as a straight, double-edged sword that can transform into a segmented, bladed whip.

        Tonitrus
        
        
        "A unique trick weapon contrived by Archibald, the infamous eccentric of the Healing Church workshop. 
        Striking this peculiar iron morning star flail like a match generates the same blue sparks that blanket a darkbeast. 
        Unfortunately, for reasons untold, the hunters of Archibald's time did not fully take to the device."
        
        
        
        Acquire the Spark Hunter Badge by defeating Darkbeast Paarl  to purchase from Messengers.
        Treasure: Yahar'gul, Unseen Village, at the top end of the road. (guarded by 2 Tainted Dogs and a Snatcher during daytime)
        
        
        
        Tonitrus is a Latin word meaning "thunder."
        The in-game description classifies this trick weapon as a morning star flail, but it's actually modeled in the form of a mace.
        The description of Archibald bears many similarities to Nikola Tesla, a famed inventor in real life who specialized in the field of electricity.
        Nikola Tesla created the Tesla Coil, a device that also bears many similarities to the Tonitrus.
        The Tonitrus also bears similarities with the aspergillum, a device used by the Roman Catholic Church to sprinkle holy water.
        According to the description of the Spark Hunter Badge, Archibald was associated with the Healing Church.
        In this sense, it may have been designed under the themes of "purificiation" and "cleansing" that is associated with many Healing Church trick weapons/tools.
        However, due to Archibald's fascination with Dark Beasts, it's more likely he designed the Tonitrus as a measure to replicate the sparks these creatures could unleash.

        Whirligig Saw
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs, and weapon of choice of the Old Hunter Valtr, the Beast Eater. 
        This weapon pummels beasts in its mace form, but its true strength lies in its attached mechanical saws. 
        These discs, lined with serrated teeth,spin rapidly, thrashing the flesh of beasts into fine shreds."
        
        
        
        From the Nightmare Church go down the stairs and follow the path. Drop down into the pools of blood of follow the path further until you reach the Cannon Executioner. Follow the left wall and turn down the path, the weapon is at the end.
        
        
        
        If you use the L2 buzzsaw attack against Orphan of Kos and hold it in place, it attempts to make an immediate counterattack for each time it gets hit by the whirring blades, only to get interrupted by the next hit. It shrieks every time it attacks, so as a result, it lets loose dozens of overlapping shriek sound effects for as long as you hold it in place.
        A whirligig is defined as a toy that is constantly spinning, such as a top or pinwheel, or as something regarded as hectic and constantly changing.
        Similar to most Powder Keg weapons sharing homage to Armored Core weapons, the Whirligig Saw is based on the Grind Blade.

        Amygdalan Arm 
        
        
        The arm of a small Amygdala Great One. 
        Strictly speaking, the Amygdalan Arm is no trick weapon of any sort, but certain madmen wield them like clubs. 
        Starts as a large, tough blunt weapon formed of bone, but when extended, the hand quivers as if it were still alive.
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare, cave at the end of the blood river to the right after getting out of the building that used to be the shortcut to the Cleric Beast in the main game. Gatling Gun Hunter dropping the Gatling Gun and a Blood-Starved Beast can be also found here. Arm is near the Blood-Starved Beast at the end of the cave.
        
        
        
        The Amygdalan Arm is a Trick Weapon in name only, considering that it is an arm obtained from Amygdala.
        The arm is remarkably small, as even the Lesser Amygdalae are huge. Perhaps it came from a newborn Amygdala.
        The arm could be the inspiration behind the Burial Blade.

        Beastly weapon wielded by Irreverent Izzy.
        Crafted by chiseling the long bones of an undead darkbeast and fastening them to the weapon. The bones are still alive, and when unleashed, grant its wielder a spurt of beastly power. 
        As flesh is flayed and blood is sprayed, the beast within awakens, and in time, the wielder of this weapon surges with both strength and feverish reverie."
        
        
        
        Ailing Loran Chalice: Layer 2 treasure room. Room is on the right when exiting the elevator from first layer boss fight, before the second layers lantern.
        Can be bought from messengers for 34000 echoes after acquisition.
        Can be bought from messengers after co-operation with player who has them. This only occurs in Hunter's dream before fight with Gehrman or Moon Presence. It is not needed to complete any Chalice Dungeons. It is unknown if this is glitch or intentional. Was patched by 1.07 or 1.08.
        
        
        
        When this weapon is equipped, your gloves will be replaced by two bone gauntlets. This can allow for the lost art of rapid glove changing if you switch your weapons really fast.
        You can charge the beasthood meter on the first windows (Gilbert) of Central Yharnam
        In the past, there was a rare glitch that allowed a player to obtain this weapon without finding it in the Chalice Dungeons.
        It has since been patched, although it isn't quite known when it was successfully patched.

        A trick weapon used by the old hunters. 
        A second blade is found inside the curve of the main one. In its initial form, the saif can be wielded like a long curved sword, but when transformed, its blade is contracted, allowing for quick, repeated stabs. 
        Although this trick weapon allows for adaptive combat, it was later replaced by saws and similar weapons that were more effective at disposing of beasts."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare. After the Blood River, when you pass through the cave with a tick, where you encounter two dogs and a large amount of crows along with an enemy Beast Cutter hunter. Climb the ladder on the left of the pit and instead of going forward, turn to the left and drop down the ledge. There will be a single piece of loot guarded by a Saif Hunter.
        
        
        
        The word "saif" is Arabic for "sword."
        
        
    

        Threaded Cane
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used by hunters on their duties. Sufficiently deadly as a rigid bladed cane, but also serves as a whip when its blade is split into many. Concealing the weapon inside the cane and flogging the beasts with the whip is partly an act of ceremony, an attempt to demonstrate to oneself that the bloodlust of the hunt will never encroach upon the soul."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired at the beginning of the game as a gift from the Messengers.
        If not selected, it is later available for purchase from the blood fountain messengers after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne).
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is used by Iosefka, Last Scholar Yurie and the Frontier Church Hunter.
        Gehrman carries a generic cane in the Workshop instead of the Threaded Cane.
        This trick weapon is possibly inspired by the sword used by Jean-Fran√ßois de Morangias in the climactic battle of French action-horror film Brotherhood of the Wolf (which bears many other similarities to Bloodborne), or the sword used by a bandit leader in the anime/manga series Claymore. Both these weapons act as a straight, double-edged sword that can transform into a segmented, bladed whip.

        Beast Cutter
        
        
        A trick weapon used by Old Hunters. 
        This thick iron cleaver slices through the toughest of beast hides, and when transformed the blade splits into sections, allowing one to lash it in the fashion of a heavy whip. 
        This crude weapon relies on brute force and is regrettably inelegant, suggesting that the hunts of the earliest hunters made for horrific affairs, painted in sanguine black and reds."
        
        
        
        When walking up the stairs to the nightmare version of the Grand Cathedral, turn left onto a small platform, then roll off and walk down some rough terrain to find the weapon on a corpse.
        
        
        
        Reminds many of the Zanpakut≈ç , a fictional segmented sword that can function as a whip. It is an iconic weapon from the Bleach anime.
        The untransformed form of the weapon is a cleaver-like serrated club, and it really looks like the samoan war club "Nifo Oti".

        Blade of mercy
        
        
        A special trick weapon passed down among hunters of hunters. One of the oldest weapons of the workshop. 
        Splits into two when activated. The weapon's warped blades are forged with siderite, a rare mineral of the heavens. Most effective swift attacks,such as after a quick-stepping."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers for 40000 echoes after obtaining the Crow Hunter Badge from Eileen the Crow's quest line.
        Killing Eileen is also a way to get the weapon early in the game.
        While progressing through Eileen's quest, it's possible for her to be killed by Henryk and thus drop the Crow Hunter Badge as a result, although the quest line will end.
        
        
        
        The Blade of Mercy was originally named as "Warped Twinblades" during the Alpha test, and it was the tool of choice for the "agile" hunter.
        Both the Burial Blade and Blade of Mercy make mentions of a mineral known as siderite in their descriptions.
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite, and it seems to be the reason why arcane power has direct scaling with both blade's damage output. Due to its extraterrestrial origins, that may explain why it cannot be buffed by an external source of any sort.
        It loosely resembles the Eleum Loyce from Dark Souls 2, a sword with two blades at the front.

        Bloodletter
        
        
        The demented hunter weapon brandished by Brador, the Healing Church assassin. 
        The Bloodletter assumes its true and terrifying form after it draws upon blood from the inner reaches of one's body and soul. 
        This is the only effective means of expelling tainted blood, or so Brador, isolated in his cell, continued to believe."
        
        
        
        Obtain the underground cell inner chamber key.
        Return to the underground prison (from the underground corpse pile lamp, go up the stairs and turn left) and open the door to Brador's cell. His cell is the second on the left behind a flight of downward stairs. Kill Brador to obtain the bloodletter.
        Brador will not be hostile in his cell, but will invade the player right outside his cell.

        Boom Hammer
        
        
        A trick weapon used by the old hunters, and crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. 
        A giant hammer equipped with a miniature furnace. When ignited and fired, it emits a volley of flame that explodes furiously upon impact. 
        Crush the beasts, then burn them - the brute simplicity of the Boom Hammer was favored by hunters with an acute distaste for beasts."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare. Inside a house that looks out of Central Yharnam, the same that is the shortcut to the cleric beast in the main game, where the 10 quicksilver bullets used to be. Be sure to shoot the explosives around the item (or act fast), as the wheelchair huntsman's corpse conceals a delayed molotov set to trigger when you try to grab the Boom Hammer, potential killing you in a huge blast.
        
        
        
        When the Boomhammer is lit, Beast Patient mobs will back away from the player as if they had a torch equipped. (May need to initiate primed attack first)

        Burial Blade
        
        
        Trick weapon wielded by Gehrman, the first hunter." 
        A masterpiece that defined the entire array of weapons crafted at the workshop. Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens. 
        Gehrman surely saw the hunt as a dirge of farewell, wishing only that his prey might rest in peace, never again to awaken to another harrowing nightmare. "
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 60,000 Blood Echoes after defeating Gehrman, the First Hunter and acquiring the Old Hunter Badge from him.
        To make Gehrman fight you, the "Refuse" option must be selected.
        If one accepts his proposal, the game will outright end there and it will be impossible to obtain this weapon in that playthrough (not including the uncanny/lost forms found in the chalice dungeons).
        Normally, the Burial Blade can only be obtained in NG+ and beyond. However, one can bypass this by using Bold Hunter's Mark, or being killed, during The Moon Presence boss battle.
        
        
        
         The Burial Blade was the first trick weapon ever created, and it inspired others to develop new trick weapons, usually on the premise of adapting to different combat scenerios.
        Not all weapons adapt to different combat scenerios (e.g. Tonitrus), but the Burial Blade still inspired an entire series of weapons that could "transform" to satisfy different purposes.
        It was created, and exclusively wielded, by Gehrman.
        A Burial Blade can be found above the workshop table in the Hunter's Dream.
        The weapon's description mentions that "Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens."
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite. Due to its extraterrestrial nature, it could be the reason why it has direct scaling with arcane and cannot be tampered by external sources.
        Both the Burial Blade and the Blade of Mercy mentions the use of it in their descriptions.
        Interestingly enough, these two weapons also resemble the talons of Mergo's Wet Nurse.
        The shape of the scythe highly resembles Rurufon's scythe from Shadow Tower Abyss, an early title created by From Software as well as being recurring weapons in Souls series.
        A strange bug on rare occurrences the cape on the hunter may come off, usually in a boss fight you could notice if you dodge back and do an R1 combo the cape disappears. [Note, I haven't seen this happen in a while, it's possible that it may have been fixed, but I'll need confirmation on this]

        Chikage
        
        
        Foreign-made weapon wielded by the royal guards who protect Annalise, Queen of the Vilebloods at Cainhurst Castle. 
        When the intricate, rippled engraving that spans the Chikage's blade is imbrued with blood, the sword sings in scarlet hues. 
        However, the rite eats away at the wielder's very essence."
        
        
        
        Join the Cainhurst Vilebloods covenant available at Cainhurst Castle, and then purchase from the Messengers for 50,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Chikage isn't actually a katana - it is a katana/european sword hybrid. Its short crossguard resembles the one of an early viking sword, or the one of a xiphos (greek sword). The closest european crossguard shape with  this sword is the one of a Karabela (a polish sabre). In other hand, the  hilt and pommel resemble the ones of a longsword (a bit longer, to get easier katana traditional jutsu swings), while the blade shape and the 2-handed fighting style is very similar to a katana. A possible explanation for the origin of this hybrid is that the katana's design was imported to Cainhurst, where some modifications were made to create a sword similar to that commonly used by their knights.
        The Chikage is an allusion to a particular 'breed' of Katanas in the Souls games. While it is similar to both the Hiltless and Chaos Blade from Demon's Souls and Dark Souls respectively, the Chikage bears a stronger resemblance to the Magic Sword "Makoto" (also from Demon's Souls). The Makoto is the only one the bunch to actually DRAIN the user's HP over time, rather than decrease it with each successful swing.
        Chikage (ÂçÉÊôØ) literally means "Thousands Views", however if you separated the word into Chi Kage (Ë°ÄÂΩ±), it means "Blood Shadow". This could be correlated to the fact that Shadows Of Yharnam wield a similar katana with a slight  crossguard, however without using the bloodtinge.
        The transforming attack has the hunter sheathe the Chikage before unleashing a strike. This is a reference to Iaijutsu, a traditional Japanese sword technique that focuses on quick-drawing. At its finest, Iaijutse allows the warrior to unsheathe and strike at incredible speeds.
        The name seems to be a tribute to Chikage Yamamura (mentioned as a "special thanks" in credits)
        The name may also be a reference to the work "1000 Plateaus" by Giles Deluze and Felix Guattari, a famous philosophical essay about fluidity and functionality, maybe dirrectly tied to the esoteric nature of the weapons function.

        Church Pick
        
        
        One of the old trick weapons of the Healing Church, a hunting weapon formed from one of the giant picks that appear in old beast tales. 
        The Church Pick initially serves as a large sword, but when transformed functions as an extended war pick. In spite of its origins, it is a highly practical weapon."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Dropped by a hunter wearing Yahar'Gul set (presumably, this is the summonable Old Hunter Defector Antal) in one of the cells that you open with the Underground Cell Key from the Research Hall. To make this battle simple, attack him through the door with a strong R2 attack, then leave the room. He will lose sight of you and his AI will return to a standstill behind the door. Rinse and repeat until dead.
        
        
        
        The Church Pick And The Hunter's Axe both have similar appearance. When transformed, both are wielded as a polearm and have the same de-transformation attack. The only difference apart from the Church Pick having a slightly more complicated mechanism is that the Hunter's Axe is a strength-based weapon.
        A few of its attacks in the transformed mode are very similar to that of the Burial Blade.

        Holy Moonlight Sword
        
        
        An arcane sword discovered long ago by Ludwig. 
        When blue moonlight dances around the sword, and it channels the abyssal cosmos, its great blade will hurl a shadowy lightwave. 
        The Holy Moonlight Sword is synonymous with Ludwig, the Holy Blade, but few have ever set eyes on the great blade, and whatever guidance it has to offer, it seems to be of a very private, elusive sort."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Found on the Underground Corpse Pile after the fight against Ludwig, The Holy Blade. Ludwig's head will be lying there and you can:
        Kill the head for the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and talk to the head. When prompted, reply "Yes" and you'll get the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and reply "No", then come back later and Simon the Harrowed will be there and give you the sword.
        NOTE: This weapon is missable. If Lawrence is killed before you obtain it, you will no longer be able to talk to the head or obtain it from Simon.
        
        
        
        It seems to be another reappearance of the Moonlight Greatsword, a recurring item found around FromSoftware's games. Notable examples of such games include the first, second and third Dark Souls games, Demon's Souls, King's Field, Ninja Blade, Enchanted Arms, Armored Core, 3D Dot Game Heroes, and Otogi.

Both these weapons act as a straight, double-edged sword that can transform into a segmented, bladed whip.

        Hunter Axe
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used on the hunt. Retains the qualities of an axe, but offers a wider palette of attacks by transforming. Boasts a heavy blunt attack, leading to high rally potential. No matter their pasts, beasts are no more than beasts. Some choose this axe to play the part of executioner."
        
        
        
        It's possible to pick this trick weapon as a starting weapon near the beginning of Bloodborne.
        If not chosen, it can instead be purchased from the Messengers after the Hunter has found the Saw Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is wielded by Father Gascoigne.
        However, he has a moveset that is different from the Hunter's version.
        He is also capable of using his unique Hunter Pistol even while his Hunter Axe is transformed, which is impossible for the Hunter to do.
        It's also wielded by the Madara's Twin who drops Madara's Whistle when defeated.
        Another hostile hunter NPC wields this trick weapon in the Nightmare Frontier.
        It's been heavily debated by the fanbase whether the transformed mode is a halberd or poleaxe.
        Both forms utilized axe heads with a spear tip at the end (although some poleaxes used hammer heads instead).
        However, neither weapon was known to have extendable handles, which is a special trademark of the Hunter Axe.
        In either case, it's possible this trick weapon was inspired by both weapons and simply incorporated many different designs.
        While wielded in it's transformed mode if the player had a torch equipped in the off-hand beasts afraid of the fire will still recoil in fear of you as if you were brandishing the torch normally (Tested on Beast Patient)
        
        
    

        Threaded Cane
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used by hunters on their duties. Sufficiently deadly as a rigid bladed cane, but also serves as a whip when its blade is split into many. Concealing the weapon inside the cane and flogging the beasts with the whip is partly an act of ceremony, an attempt to demonstrate to oneself that the bloodlust of the hunt will never encroach upon the soul."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired at the beginning of the game as a gift from the Messengers.
        If not selected, it is later available for purchase from the blood fountain messengers after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne).

        Kirkhammer
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. On the one side, an easily handled silver sword. On the other, a giant obtuse stone weapon, characterized by a blunt strike and extreme force of impact. The Church takes a heavy-handed, merciless stance toward the plague of beasts, an irony not lost upon the wielders of this most symbolic weapon."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers after acquiring the Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        A miniature of the Kirkhammer was included as the Pre-Order Bonus for Asian editions of Bloodborne. [See the Bundles page for details]
        A "kirk" is an archaic old english word meaning "church."
        This means the weapon is literately known as the Church Hammer.
        The wording also might be a nod to Nordic culture since the word "Kirk" originated from northern England and Old Norse wording.
        The etched wording on the side of the hammer part has similarities to the Old Norse alphabet.
        However, it also has similarities to the Elder Futhark, one of the oldest forms of the runic alphabet system used by Germanic tribes.
        Similar etchings can be found on gravestones all over Yharnam.
        The sword used for this weapon is very similar to the one used for Ludwig's Holy Blade.
        This suggests that the Healing Church used the method of "interchangeable parts" to efficiently mass produce weapons for their hunters.
        However, the sword used for the Kirkhammer is shorter.
        It's wielded by Alfred, should you choose to be friends with him.
        He uses this weapon as a summon.
        However, he wields the Logarius' Wheel if you find him in Cainhurst Castle under special circumstances.
        When untransformed, with the hammer part on the character's back, some cloth parts (capes etc.) of the armor can either get awkwardly stuck on it or cover it.
        Despite being labeled a 'stone weapon', the etchings, wear, and sound produced when it strikes indicate that the hammer is in fact made of metal.
        
        
    

        Threaded Cane

        Kos Parasite
        
        
        When the carcass of Kos washed up on the coast, its insides were teeming with tiny parasites, unlike any found in humans. 
        This atypical weapon can only be clasped tight and swung, but a Kos Parasite is said to stimulate phantasms inhabiting a lumenwood"
        
        
        
        Dropped by Orphan of Kos
        
        
        
        The Kos Parasite is perhaps the most interestingly unique weapon in Bloodborne in various ways: It is one of two weapons that can reach it's full potential while using a rune (the other being Beast Claw), the weapon itself is not held, it is purely an arcane weapon, it is the only weapon directly dropped by defeating a boss, it has the highest durability of any weapon at 600 respectively, it is the only weapon to have an A-scaling of any weapon without any upgrades and is the only weapon to have an S-scaling by upgrading it twice.

        Logarius's Wheel
        
        
        "Weapon wielded by martyr Logarius' band of executioners. 
        Used to slaughter the Vilebloods in Cainhurst. Bathed in pools of their blood, and forever steeped in their ire. 
        Transform to release the power of the wheel and manifest their lingering rage in a show of utter brilliance."
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 13,000 Blood Echoes after acquiring the Wheel Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        Alfred utilizes the Logarius' Wheel when found in Cainhurst Castle.
        This weapon is yet another reference to Berserk, as they are often made in Miyazaki's previous Souls games.
        "Logarius and his band of executioners" bear many similarities to Mozgus, an insanely devout man who traveled the land torturing heretics along with his disciples.
        The wheel in particular was wielded by one of his six disciples, .
        In Dark Souls, Bonewheel Skeletons are another reference to Mozgus' disciples.
        In real life, although wheels weren't typically wielded as weapons, they were commonly used as torture devices, especially during the Middle Ages.
        Torture wheels were nicknamed "breaking wheels," since victims often times would have their limbs broken during the process.
        They were also known as "catherine wheels."
         It's quite possible that Logarius' Wheel also takes some inspiration in its use as a weapon from the English folklore legend of Tom Hickathrift. Tom was a fabled giant killer who made use of a cartwheel to vanquish the Wisbech Giant (also referred to as an ogre).
        Lore theories can be found under "From Berserk to Bloodborne".

        Ludwig's Holy Blade
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. It is said that the silver sword was employed by Ludwig, the first hunter of the church. When transformed, it combines with its sheath to form a greatsword. 
        It exhibits several departures from the workshop's design, suggesting that the Church anticipated much larger inhuman beasts."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased for 20,000 echoes from the Messengers after obtaining the Radiant Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon was wielded by Ludwig, a famous hunter of the Healing Church who designed the blade based on the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        According to the description, Ludwig wielded this sword in combat instead of the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        However, in his boss fight, he wields the Holy Moonlight Sword during a certain part in the fight.
        It is possible that Ludwig wielded the Holy Moonlight Sword and his fellow hunters, inspired by the huge weapon, sought to make replicas. Unable to make a magic sword, a huge metal sheath was the compromise.
        Before the DLC's release, Ludwig's Holy Blade was thought of as From Software's traditional "Moonlight Greatsword" seen throughout various games by the fanbase.
        However, this sword was eventually revealed in the DLC to be a replica of the "true" Moonlight Greatsword in Bloodborne, the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        This isn't the first time Miyazaki used the name of classical music composers in a game.
        A boss from the first "Dark Souls" game, Dragonslayer Ornstein, is named after Leo Ornstein.
        Berlioz from "Armored Core 4" is named after Hector Berlioz.
        The normal form of this weapon is very similar to the sword used for the Kirkhammer.
        However, this sword's normal form has a slightly longer reach when compared to the Kirkhammer's blade.
        The similar nature of these swords suggests that the Healing Church used the method of interchangeable parts to quickly mass produce weapons for their hunters.
        Lore theories exist under Ebrietas Lore.

        Rakuyo
        
        
        Hunter weapon wielded by Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower. 
        A trick sword originated in the same country as the Cainhurst Chikage, only this sword feeds not off blood, but instead demands great dexterity. 
        Lady Maria was fond of this aspect of the Rakuyo, as she frowned upon blood blades, despite being a distant relative of the queen. 
        One day, she abandoned her beloved Rakuyo, casting it into a dark well, when she could stomach it no longer."
        
        
        
        Fishing Hamlet. Get to the bottom of the well. Can be reached from the underground tunnels at the end of the area or via a ladder in the well right away. In that area a Shark Giant will wander around. Fighting him makes a second one appear after the first reaches sufficiently low health. The first giant will walk over near the ladder and scream at the ceiling, causing the second one to drop. The second one drops the weapon.
        Fighting the two of them can be difficult and it is a good idea to use the Shaman Bone Blade to make them fight each other and finish off the weaker one. Molotov cocktails are also very effective against them. If neither is available to you, try to kill the one with the anchor first, as it is significantly harder to dodge.
        One easy way to beat them is use of ranged weapon like Simon's Bowblade if you are a bloodtinge build, and the Holy Moonlight Sword if you are an arcane build.
        A Threaded Cane's transformed whip can easily hit the giants from the ledge once they're lured over and begin attacking, but be sure to keep your distance after each hit. Except that there is no way to lure them over the the ledge. No ranged weapon will hit the one standing at the back and the one hanging from the ceiling doesn't drop down until the first one is at 50% health. 
        Unlike other giants in the game, these ones are easy to gun parry for a visceral attack. Keep in mind this will get very tricky after the other one starts fighting, so try to separate them and time your viscerals to get the invincibility at the right moment.
        If your range is inadequate you can use the monocular to angle a throwing knife to be able to hit the shark giant in the back. This way, you can continue from the strategy of killing them on the ledge with a gun/magic without going around. (confirmed as of January 19th, 2019)
        Chaining together backstabs is a very effecient way of dealing with them, if played right you should be able to eliminate the first shark giant before the second reaches you this way. It is extremely difficult to get behind the patrolling Shark Giant without him detecting you. 
        For a video showing an easy way to kill the sharks with a monocular and a throwing knife strategy, check .
        
        
        
        Rakuyo (ËêΩËëâ) literally means "falling leaf".
        The sword of Rakuyo bears resemblance to the "ky≈´ gunt≈ç", which was a hybrid of the sabre/katana with a handguard, used during the Russo-Japanese War.

        Reiterpallasch
        
        
        Weapon wielded by the Knights of Cainhurst. 
        Combines an elegant knight's sword with the peculiar firearm wielded by the Cainhurst order. 
        The old nobles, long-time imbibers of blood, are no strangers to the sanguine plague, and the disposal of beasts was a discrete task left to their servants, or knights, as they were called for the sake of appearances."
        
        
        
        It's found in a chest located in the entrance hall of Cainhurst Castle, where the Bound Widows are first encountered. When you first enter the room from the main entrance, run towards your two o'clock. The chest will be found in a corner.
        
        
        
        The Reiterpallasch (from German Reiter "horseback rider" and hungarian pallos [Ààp…ílo É] "sword") is a 17th century Hungarian straight sword with a typically double edged blade and guarded hilt that was used by Hungarian noble cavalry and later adapted by most western European armies.
        As pointed out in its description, the rifle spear is made "possibly in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon" (i.e. this one).
        Wynne D. Fanchon from Armored Core: For Answer; another From Software title, pilots a NEXT named Reiterpallasch.

        Rifle Spear
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. A prototype weapon serving as a simple firearm and spear, possibly created in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon. Lacks any notable functions, saving that it is the only trick weapon with an attached gun. "
        
        
        
        It can be found inside a hidden building in Old Yharnam. From the area you fight the first NPC Hunter (who wields a saw spear), drop down where the railing is missing in a corner and land on the ledges below. Go into the building and follow the stairs up; eventually you can find it stashed on a corpse tucked away in a hidden nook as you advance.
        Bought from the messengers for 4000 blood echoes after acquiring the Powder Keg Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        According to the Rifle Spear's description, it was designed as an imitation of "a lost Cainhurst weapon".
        That particular weapon may or may not be the Reiterpallasch.
        It should be noted these two weapons are the only two skill/firearm hybrids whose alternate forms utilize guns.
        The third skill/firearm hybrid weapon in this game is Simon's Bowblade, which transforms from a sword into a bow.
        The Rifle Spear is carried by a Yahar'Gul Hunter in the Cathedral Ward.
        This fight can be tricky because you first encounter a Yahar'Gul Hunter that uses a Tonitrus near the base of the stairs, and if you advance too far towards the houses, the Rifle Spear Yahar'Gul Hunter will join the fight as well.
        He also uses Ludwig's Rifle, meaning he can hit you from a considerable distance with shotgun pellets no matter what mode he uses for the Rifle Spear.

        This trick weapon is possibly inspired by the sword used by Jean-Fran√ßois de Morangias in the climactic battle of French action-horror film Brotherhood of the Wolf (which bears many other similarities to Bloodborne), or the sword used by a bandit leader in the anime/manga series Claymore. Both these weapons act as a straight, double-edged sword that can transform into a segmented, bladed whip.

        Saw Cleaver
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used in the hunting business. 
        This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts, transforms into a long cleaver that makes use of centrifugal force. 
        The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness the more grotesquely transformed the beast."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired as a gift from the Messengers the first time you visit the Hunter's Dream.
        If you don't select it, you may buy it after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne.)
        
        
        
        The Saw Cleaver is the Trick Weapon featured on the title screen.
        It was also one of the first weapons to be revealed for this game.
        Overall the mechanisms of this weapon didn't change at all, starting all the way back when Bloodborne was still known as "Project Beast."
        According to the concept art, the Saw Cleaver uses a trigger mechanism to unlock the joint during transformation.
        The design of the Saw Cleaver seems to be inspired by multiple references:
        The transformed cleaver shows a resemblance to LB-66 MOONLIGHT from Armored Core V.
        The Japanese name is written as "nokogiri nata" („Éé„Ç≥„ÇÆ„É™Èâà) or "saw hatchet". Nokogiri is a traditional Japanese saw that cuts from the pull stroke, as opposed to the more common push stroke.
        In real life, there is a type of cleaver known as a mezzaluna ("half moon") cleaver, known for chopping/mincing up various food products.
        Most of these types of cleavers have handles on both ends.
        However, some use a single handle that stretches across the blade, which was used to chop up herbs usually; the saw cleaver follows this particular model.
        Coincidentally, the Strength/Skill/Arcane scaling at maximum level is "CDC" in their respective order.
        The CDC is an American organization designed to combat and prevent "health threats" of varying natures.
        Since the beast scourge acts like a plague (and is spread due to blood-related reasons), those who wield the Saw Cleaver can be thought of as fighting a dangerous epidemic.
        Henryk uses this weapon when he fights you and Eileen the Crow during her questline, as well as when he is summoned by you when using the Old Hunter Bell.
        
        
    

        Threaded Cane
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used by hunters on their duties. Sufficiently deadly as a rigid bladed cane, but also serves as a whip when its blade is split into many. Concealing the weapon inside the cane and flogging the beasts with the whip is partly an act of ceremony, an attempt to demonstrate to oneself that the bloodlust of the hunt will never encroach upon the soul."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired at the beginning of the game as a gift from the Messengers.
        If not selected, it is later available for purchase from the blood fountain messengers after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne).

        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used by those who dedicate themselves to the hunt. This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts, transforms into a medium-range spear. The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness the more grotesquely transformed the beast."
        
        
        
        Can be bought from the Bath Messengers, after obtaining the Saw Hunter Badge, for 1,000 Blood Echoes.
        Treasure in Central Yharnam Sewer, on the ledge above the dead end with boats. You also need to cut down the corpse hanging from the rafters high above.
        
        
        
        Carried by Djura's Ally in Old Yharnam.

        Simon's Bowblade
        
        
        Choice weapon of Simon, one of the first Healing Church hunters.
        Simon despised firearms, and so the Church workshop had this specially fashioned to his liking. The large curved blade serves as a bow when transformed.
        But aside from a few close friends, Simon was scoffed at for his choice of arms, for who would dare face the beasts with a measly bow?"
        
        
        
        Fishing Hamlet: Found on the body of Simon the Harrowed next to the Lighthouse Hut lantern after answering the first option at the Hunter's Nightmare shortcut and going through his quest-line. Interact with him as he lies on the ground to obtain the weapon.
        You may also kill Simon the Harrowed at The Hunter's Nightmare or Research Hall to obtain the weapon.
        
        
        
        Simon's Bowblade is the only weapon to have a S-scaling for two attributes (Skill and Bloodtinge respectively) when fully upgraded

        Stake Driver
        
        
        A trick weapon fashioned by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. Favored by the retired hunter Djura. 
        The stake driver, with its queerly complex design, violently drives thick stakes into the flesh of foes. 
        The stake driver allows for high-damage critical attacks, but is difficult to use and leaves its wielder wide open, but none of this should bother a mere Powder Keg."
        
        
        
        Obtain Powder Keg Hunter Badge to unlock for purchase at the Messengers for 8,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Stake Driver is exclusively wielded by Djura when he is still hostile towards you.
        His fight is tricky because the area around him is very limited, meaning you can fall to your death if you're not careful.
        Furthermore, the limited space is perfect for his choice of weapon which has a short range.
        This is modeled after the "Pile Bunker," a type of fictional weaponry which launches piston with gunpowder or explosion.
        In the Japanese version of Bloodborne, this weapon is literally called the Pile Hammer („Éë„Ç§„É´„Éè„É≥„Éû„Éº).
        It bears a striking resemblance to the "Parrying Blade" weapons seen in several "Armored Core" games.
        Has the highest charged attack multiplier out of any other weapon.

        Tonitrus
        
        
        "A unique trick weapon contrived by Archibald, the infamous eccentric of the Healing Church workshop. 
        Striking this peculiar iron morning star flail like a match generates the same blue sparks that blanket a darkbeast. 
        Unfortunately, for reasons untold, the hunters of Archibald's time did not fully take to the device."
        
        
        
        Acquire the Spark Hunter Badge by defeating Darkbeast Paarl  to purchase from Messengers.
        Treasure: Yahar'gul, Unseen Village, at the top end of the road. (guarded by 2 Tainted Dogs and a Snatcher during daytime)
        
        
        
        Tonitrus is a Latin word meaning "thunder."
        The in-game description classifies this trick weapon as a morning star flail, but it's actually modeled in the form of a mace.
        The description of Archibald bears many similarities to Nikola Tesla, a famed inventor in real life who specialized in the field of electricity.
        Nikola Tesla created the Tesla Coil, a device that also bears many similarities to the Tonitrus.
        The Tonitrus also bears similarities with the aspergillum, a device used by the Roman Catholic Church to sprinkle holy water.
        According to the description of the Spark Hunter Badge, Archibald was associated with the Healing Church.
        In this sense, it may have been designed under the themes of "purificiation" and "cleansing" that is associated with many Healing Church trick weapons/tools.
        However, due to Archibald's fascination with Dark Beasts, it's more likely he designed the Tonitrus as a measure to replicate the sparks these creatures could unleash.

        Whirligig Saw
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs, and weapon of choice of the Old Hunter Valtr, the Beast Eater. 
        This weapon pummels beasts in its mace form, but its true strength lies in its attached mechanical saws. 
        These discs, lined with serrated teeth,spin rapidly, thrashing the flesh of beasts into fine shreds."
        
        
        
        From the Nightmare Church go down the stairs and follow the path. Drop down into the pools of blood of follow the path further until you reach the Cannon Executioner. Follow the left wall and turn down the path, the weapon is at the end.
        
        
        
        If you use the L2 buzzsaw attack against Orphan of Kos and hold it in place, it attempts to make an immediate counterattack for each time it gets hit by the whirring blades, only to get interrupted by the next hit. It shrieks every time it attacks, so as a result, it lets loose dozens of overlapping shriek sound effects for as long as you hold it in place.
        A whirligig is defined as a toy that is constantly spinning, such as a top or pinwheel, or as something regarded as hectic and constantly changing.
        Similar to most Powder Keg weapons sharing homage to Armored Core weapons, the Whirligig Saw is based on the Grind Blade.

        Amygdalan Arm 
        
        
        The arm of a small Amygdala Great One. 
        Strictly speaking, the Amygdalan Arm is no trick weapon of any sort, but certain madmen wield them like clubs. 
        Starts as a large, tough blunt weapon formed of bone, but when extended, the hand quivers as if it were still alive.
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare, cave at the end of the blood river to the right after getting out of the building that used to be the shortcut to the Cleric Beast in the main game. Gatling Gun Hunter dropping the Gatling Gun and a Blood-Starved Beast can be also found here. Arm is near the Blood-Starved Beast at the end of the cave.
        
        
        
        The Amygdalan Arm is a Trick Weapon in name only, considering that it is an arm obtained from Amygdala.
        The arm is remarkably small, as even the Lesser Amygdalae are huge. Perhaps it came from a newborn Amygdala.
        The arm could be the inspiration behind the Burial Blade.

        Beastly weapon wielded by Irreverent Izzy.
        Crafted by chiseling the long bones of an undead darkbeast and fastening them to the weapon. The bones are still alive, and when unleashed, grant its wielder a spurt of beastly power. 
        As flesh is flayed and blood is sprayed, the beast within awakens, and in time, the wielder of this weapon surges with both strength and feverish reverie."

        Can be bought from messengers for 34000 echoes after acquisition.
        Can be bought from messengers after co-operation with player who has them. This only occurs in Hunter's dream before fight with Gehrman or Moon Presence. It is not needed to complete any Chalice Dungeons. It is unknown if this is glitch or intentional. Was patched by 1.07 or 1.08.
        
        
        
        When this weapon is equipped, your gloves will be replaced by two bone gauntlets. This can allow for the lost art of rapid glove changing if you switch your weapons really fast.
        You can charge the beasthood meter on the first windows (Gilbert) of Central Yharnam
        In the past, there was a rare glitch that allowed a player to obtain this weapon without finding it in the Chalice Dungeons.
        It has since been patched, although it isn't quite known when it was successfully patched.

        Beasthunter Saif
        
        
        A trick weapon used by the old hunters. 
        A second blade is found inside the curve of the main one. In its initial form, the saif can be wielded like a long curved sword, but when transformed, its blade is contracted, allowing for quick, repeated stabs. 
        Although this trick weapon allows for adaptive combat, it was later replaced by saws and similar weapons that were more effective at disposing of beasts."

        Beast Cutter
        
        
        A trick weapon used by Old Hunters. 
        This thick iron cleaver slices through the toughest of beast hides, and when transformed the blade splits into sections, allowing one to lash it in the fashion of a heavy whip. 
        This crude weapon relies on brute force and is regrettably inelegant, suggesting that the hunts of the earliest hunters made for horrific affairs, painted in sanguine black and reds."
        
        
        
        When walking up the stairs to the nightmare version of the Grand Cathedral, turn left onto a small platform, then roll off and walk down some rough terrain to find the weapon on a corpse.
        
        
        
        Reminds many of the Zanpakut≈ç , a fictional segmented sword that can function as a whip. It is an iconic weapon from the Bleach anime.
        The untransformed form of the weapon is a cleaver-like serrated club, and it really looks like the samoan war club "Nifo Oti".

        Blade of mercy
        
        
        A special trick weapon passed down among hunters of hunters. One of the oldest weapons of the workshop. 
        Splits into two when activated. The weapon's warped blades are forged with siderite, a rare mineral of the heavens. Most effective swift attacks,such as after a quick-stepping."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers for 40000 echoes after obtaining the Crow Hunter Badge from Eileen the Crow's quest line.
        Killing Eileen is also a way to get the weapon early in the game.
        While progressing through Eileen's quest, it's possible for her to be killed by Henryk and thus drop the Crow Hunter Badge as a result, although the quest line will end.
        
        
        
        The Blade of Mercy was originally named as "Warped Twinblades" during the Alpha test, and it was the tool of choice for the "agile" hunter.
        Both the Burial Blade and Blade of Mercy make mentions of a mineral known as siderite in their descriptions.
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite, and it seems to be the reason why arcane power has direct scaling with both blade's damage output. Due to its extraterrestrial origins, that may explain why it cannot be buffed by an external source of any sort.
        It loosely resembles the Eleum Loyce from Dark Souls 2, a sword with two blades at the front.

        The demented hunter weapon brandished by Brador, the Healing Church assassin. 
        The Bloodletter assumes its true and terrifying form after it draws upon blood from the inner reaches of one's body and soul. 
        This is the only effective means of expelling tainted blood, or so Brador, isolated in his cell, continued to believe."
        
        
        
        Obtain the underground cell inner chamber key.
        Return to the underground prison (from the underground corpse pile lamp, go up the stairs and turn left) and open the door to Brador's cell. His cell is the second on the left behind a flight of downward stairs. Kill Brador to obtain the bloodletter.
        Brador will not be hostile in his cell, but will invade the player right outside his cell.

        A giant hammer equipped with a miniature furnace. When ignited and fired, it emits a volley of flame that explodes furiously upon impact. 
        Crush the beasts, then burn them - the brute simplicity of the Boom Hammer was favored by hunters with an acute distaste for beasts."

        Burial Blade
        
        
        Trick weapon wielded by Gehrman, the first hunter." 
        A masterpiece that defined the entire array of weapons crafted at the workshop. Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens. 
        Gehrman surely saw the hunt as a dirge of farewell, wishing only that his prey might rest in peace, never again to awaken to another harrowing nightmare. "
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 60,000 Blood Echoes after defeating Gehrman, the First Hunter and acquiring the Old Hunter Badge from him.
        To make Gehrman fight you, the "Refuse" option must be selected.
        If one accepts his proposal, the game will outright end there and it will be impossible to obtain this weapon in that playthrough (not including the uncanny/lost forms found in the chalice dungeons).
        Normally, the Burial Blade can only be obtained in NG+ and beyond. However, one can bypass this by using Bold Hunter's Mark, or being killed, during The Moon Presence boss battle.
        
        
        
         The Burial Blade was the first trick weapon ever created, and it inspired others to develop new trick weapons, usually on the premise of adapting to different combat scenerios.
        Not all weapons adapt to different combat scenerios (e.g. Tonitrus), but the Burial Blade still inspired an entire series of weapons that could "transform" to satisfy different purposes.
        It was created, and exclusively wielded, by Gehrman.
        A Burial Blade can be found above the workshop table in the Hunter's Dream.
        The weapon's description mentions that "Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens."
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite. Due to its extraterrestrial nature, it could be the reason why it has direct scaling with arcane and cannot be tampered by external sources.
        Both the Burial Blade and the Blade of Mercy mentions the use of it in their descriptions.
        Interestingly enough, these two weapons also resemble the talons of Mergo's Wet Nurse.
        The shape of the scythe highly resembles Rurufon's scythe from Shadow Tower Abyss, an early title created by From Software as well as being recurring weapons in Souls series.
        A strange bug on rare occurrences the cape on the hunter may come off, usually in a boss fight you could notice if you dodge back and do an R1 combo the cape disappears. [Note, I haven't seen this happen in a while, it's possible that it may have been fixed, but I'll need confirmation on this]

        Chikage
        
        
        Foreign-made weapon wielded by the royal guards who protect Annalise, Queen of the Vilebloods at Cainhurst Castle. 
        When the intricate, rippled engraving that spans the Chikage's blade is imbrued with blood, the sword sings in scarlet hues. 
        However, the rite eats away at the wielder's very essence."
        
        
        
        Join the Cainhurst Vilebloods covenant available at Cainhurst Castle, and then purchase from the Messengers for 50,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Chikage isn't actually a katana - it is a katana/european sword hybrid. Its short crossguard resembles the one of an early viking sword, or the one of a xiphos (greek sword). The closest european crossguard shape with  this sword is the one of a Karabela (a polish sabre). In other hand, the  hilt and pommel resemble the ones of a longsword (a bit longer, to get easier katana traditional jutsu swings), while the blade shape and the 2-handed fighting style is very similar to a katana. A possible explanation for the origin of this hybrid is that the katana's design was imported to Cainhurst, where some modifications were made to create a sword similar to that commonly used by their knights.
        The Chikage is an allusion to a particular 'breed' of Katanas in the Souls games. While it is similar to both the Hiltless and Chaos Blade from Demon's Souls and Dark Souls respectively, the Chikage bears a stronger resemblance to the Magic Sword "Makoto" (also from Demon's Souls). The Makoto is the only one the bunch to actually DRAIN the user's HP over time, rather than decrease it with each successful swing.
        Chikage (ÂçÉÊôØ) literally means "Thousands Views", however if you separated the word into Chi Kage (Ë°ÄÂΩ±), it means "Blood Shadow". This could be correlated to the fact that Shadows Of Yharnam wield a similar katana with a slight  crossguard, however without using the bloodtinge.
        The transforming attack has the hunter sheathe the Chikage before unleashing a strike. This is a reference to Iaijutsu, a traditional Japanese sword technique that focuses on quick-drawing. At its finest, Iaijutse allows the warrior to unsheathe and strike at incredible speeds.
        The name seems to be a tribute to Chikage Yamamura (mentioned as a "special thanks" in credits)
        The name may also be a reference to the work "1000 Plateaus" by Giles Deluze and Felix Guattari, a famous philosophical essay about fluidity and functionality, maybe dirrectly tied to the esoteric nature of the weapons function.

        Church Pick
        
        
        One of the old trick weapons of the Healing Church, a hunting weapon formed from one of the giant picks that appear in old beast tales. 
        The Church Pick initially serves as a large sword, but when transformed functions as an extended war pick. In spite of its origins, it is a highly practical weapon."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Dropped by a hunter wearing Yahar'Gul set (presumably, this is the summonable Old Hunter Defector Antal) in one of the cells that you open with the Underground Cell Key from the Research Hall. To make this battle simple, attack him through the door with a strong R2 attack, then leave the room. He will lose sight of you and his AI will return to a standstill behind the door. Rinse and repeat until dead.
        
        
        
        The Church Pick And The Hunter's Axe both have similar appearance. When transformed, both are wielded as a polearm and have the same de-transformation attack. The only difference apart from the Church Pick having a slightly more complicated mechanism is that the Hunter's Axe is a strength-based weapon.
        A few of its attacks in the transformed mode are very similar to that of the Burial Blade.

        Tonitrus is a Latin word meaning "thunder."
        The in-game description classifies this trick weapon as a morning star flail, but it's actually modeled in the form of a mace.
        The description of Archibald bears many similarities to Nikola Tesla, a famed inventor in real life who specialized in the field of electricity.
        Nikola Tesla created the Tesla Coil, a device that also bears many similarities to the Tonitrus.
        The Tonitrus also bears similarities with the aspergillum, a device used by the Roman Catholic Church to sprinkle holy water.
        According to the description of the Spark Hunter Badge, Archibald was associated with the Healing Church.
        In this sense, it may have been designed under the themes of "purificiation" and "cleansing" that is associated with many Healing Church trick weapons/tools.
        However, due to Archibald's fascination with Dark Beasts, it's more likely he designed the Tonitrus as a measure to replicate the sparks these creatures could unleash.

        Holy Moonlight Sword
        
        
        An arcane sword discovered long ago by Ludwig. 
        When blue moonlight dances around the sword, and it channels the abyssal cosmos, its great blade will hurl a shadowy lightwave. 
        The Holy Moonlight Sword is synonymous with Ludwig, the Holy Blade, but few have ever set eyes on the great blade, and whatever guidance it has to offer, it seems to be of a very private, elusive sort."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Found on the Underground Corpse Pile after the fight against Ludwig, The Holy Blade. Ludwig's head will be lying there and you can:
        Kill the head for the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and talk to the head. When prompted, reply "Yes" and you'll get the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and reply "No", then come back later and Simon the Harrowed will be there and give you the sword.
        NOTE: This weapon is missable. If Lawrence is killed before you obtain it, you will no longer be able to talk to the head or obtain it from Simon.
        
        
        
        It seems to be another reappearance of the Moonlight Greatsword, a recurring item found around FromSoftware's games. Notable examples of such games include the first, second and third Dark Souls games, Demon's Souls, King's Field, Ninja Blade, Enchanted Arms, Armored Core, 3D Dot Game Heroes, and Otogi.
        Lore theories exist under "Ebrietas Lore".

        Hunter Axe
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used on the hunt. Retains the qualities of an axe, but offers a wider palette of attacks by transforming. Boasts a heavy blunt attack, leading to high rally potential. No matter their pasts, beasts are no more than beasts. Some choose this axe to play the part of executioner."
        
        
        
        It's possible to pick this trick weapon as a starting weapon near the beginning of Bloodborne.
        If not chosen, it can instead be purchased from the Messengers after the Hunter has found the Saw Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is wielded by Father Gascoigne.
        However, he has a moveset that is different from the Hunter's version.
        He is also capable of using his unique Hunter Pistol even while his Hunter Axe is transformed, which is impossible for the Hunter to do.
        It's also wielded by the Madara's Twin who drops Madara's Whistle when defeated.
        Another hostile hunter NPC wields this trick weapon in the Nightmare Frontier.
        It's been heavily debated by the fanbase whether the transformed mode is a halberd or poleaxe.
        Both forms utilized axe heads with a spear tip at the end (although some poleaxes used hammer heads instead).
        However, neither weapon was known to have extendable handles, which is a special trademark of the Hunter Axe.
        In either case, it's possible this trick weapon was inspired by both weapons and simply incorporated many different designs.
        While wielded in it's transformed mode if the player had a torch equipped in the off-hand beasts afraid of the fire will still recoil in fear of you as if you were brandishing the torch normally (Tested on Beast Patient)

        Kirkhammer
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. On the one side, an easily handled silver sword. On the other, a giant obtuse stone weapon, characterized by a blunt strike and extreme force of impact. The Church takes a heavy-handed, merciless stance toward the plague of beasts, an irony not lost upon the wielders of this most symbolic weapon."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers after acquiring the Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        A miniature of the Kirkhammer was included as the Pre-Order Bonus for Asian editions of Bloodborne. [See the Bundles page for details]
        A "kirk" is an archaic old english word meaning "church."
        This means the weapon is literately known as the Church Hammer.
        The wording also might be a nod to Nordic culture since the word "Kirk" originated from northern England and Old Norse wording.
        The etched wording on the side of the hammer part has similarities to the Old Norse alphabet.
        However, it also has similarities to the Elder Futhark, one of the oldest forms of the runic alphabet system used by Germanic tribes.
        Similar etchings can be found on gravestones all over Yharnam.
        The sword used for this weapon is very similar to the one used for Ludwig's Holy Blade.
        This suggests that the Healing Church used the method of "interchangeable parts" to efficiently mass produce weapons for their hunters.
        However, the sword used for the Kirkhammer is shorter.
        It's wielded by Alfred, should you choose to be friends with him.
        He uses this weapon as a summon.
        However, he wields the Logarius' Wheel if you find him in Cainhurst Castle under special circumstances.
        When untransformed, with the hammer part on the character's back, some cloth parts (capes etc.) of the armor can either get awkwardly stuck on it or cover it.
        Despite being labeled a 'stone weapon', the etchings, wear, and sound produced when it strikes indicate that the hammer is in fact made of metal.

        Logarius's Wheel
        
        
        "Weapon wielded by martyr Logarius' band of executioners. 
        Used to slaughter the Vilebloods in Cainhurst. Bathed in pools of their blood, and forever steeped in their ire. 
        Transform to release the power of the wheel and manifest their lingering rage in a show of utter brilliance."
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 13,000 Blood Echoes after acquiring the Wheel Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        Alfred utilizes the Logarius' Wheel when found in Cainhurst Castle.
        This weapon is yet another reference to Berserk, as they are often made in Miyazaki's previous Souls games.
        "Logarius and his band of executioners" bear many similarities to Mozgus, an insanely devout man who traveled the land torturing heretics along with his disciples.
        The wheel in particular was wielded by one of his six disciples, .
        In Dark Souls, Bonewheel Skeletons are another reference to Mozgus' disciples.
        In real life, although wheels weren't typically wielded as weapons, they were commonly used as torture devices, especially during the Middle Ages.
        Torture wheels were nicknamed "breaking wheels," since victims often times would have their limbs broken during the process.
        They were also known as "catherine wheels."
         It's quite possible that Logarius' Wheel also takes some inspiration in its use as a weapon from the English folklore legend of Tom Hickathrift. Tom was a fabled giant killer who made use of a cartwheel to vanquish the Wisbech Giant (also referred to as an ogre).
        Lore theories can be found under "From Berserk to Bloodborne".

        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. It is said that the silver sword was employed by Ludwig, the first hunter of the church. When transformed, it combines with its sheath to form a greatsword. 
        It exhibits several departures from the workshop's design, suggesting that the Church anticipated much larger inhuman beasts."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased for 20,000 echoes from the Messengers after obtaining the Radiant Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon was wielded by Ludwig, a famous hunter of the Healing Church who designed the blade based on the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        According to the description, Ludwig wielded this sword in combat instead of the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        However, in his boss fight, he wields the Holy Moonlight Sword during a certain part in the fight.
        It is possible that Ludwig wielded the Holy Moonlight Sword and his fellow hunters, inspired by the huge weapon, sought to make replicas. Unable to make a magic sword, a huge metal sheath was the compromise.
        Before the DLC's release, Ludwig's Holy Blade was thought of as From Software's traditional "Moonlight Greatsword" seen throughout various games by the fanbase.
        However, this sword was eventually revealed in the DLC to be a replica of the "true" Moonlight Greatsword in Bloodborne, the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        This isn't the first time Miyazaki used the name of classical music composers in a game.
        A boss from the first "Dark Souls" game, Dragonslayer Ornstein, is named after Leo Ornstein.
        Berlioz from "Armored Core 4" is named after Hector Berlioz.
        The normal form of this weapon is very similar to the sword used for the Kirkhammer.
        However, this sword's normal form has a slightly longer reach when compared to the Kirkhammer's blade.
        The similar nature of these swords suggests that the Healing Church used the method of interchangeable parts to quickly mass produce weapons for their hunters.

        Rakuyo
        
        
        Hunter weapon wielded by Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower. 
        A trick sword originated in the same country as the Cainhurst Chikage, only this sword feeds not off blood, but instead demands great dexterity. 
        Lady Maria was fond of this aspect of the Rakuyo, as she frowned upon blood blades, despite being a distant relative of the queen. 
        One day, she abandoned her beloved Rakuyo, casting it into a dark well, when she could stomach it no longer."
        
        
        
        Fishing Hamlet. Get to the bottom of the well. Can be reached from the underground tunnels at the end of the area or via a ladder in the well right away. In that area a Shark Giant will wander around. Fighting him makes a second one appear after the first reaches sufficiently low health. The first giant will walk over near the ladder and scream at the ceiling, causing the second one to drop. The second one drops the weapon.
        Fighting the two of them can be difficult and it is a good idea to use the Shaman Bone Blade to make them fight each other and finish off the weaker one. Molotov cocktails are also very effective against them. If neither is available to you, try to kill the one with the anchor first, as it is significantly harder to dodge.
        One easy way to beat them is use of ranged weapon like Simon's Bowblade if you are a bloodtinge build, and the Holy Moonlight Sword if you are an arcane build.
        A Threaded Cane's transformed whip can easily hit the giants from the ledge once they're lured over and begin attacking, but be sure to keep your distance after each hit. Except that there is no way to lure them over the the ledge. No ranged weapon will hit the one standing at the back and the one hanging from the ceiling doesn't drop down until the first one is at 50% health. 
        Unlike other giants in the game, these ones are easy to gun parry for a visceral attack. Keep in mind this will get very tricky after the other one starts fighting, so try to separate them and time your viscerals to get the invincibility at the right moment.
        If your range is inadequate you can use the monocular to angle a throwing knife to be able to hit the shark giant in the back. This way, you can continue from the strategy of killing them on the ledge with a gun/magic without going around. (confirmed as of January 19th, 2019)
        Chaining together backstabs is a very effecient way of dealing with them, if played right you should be able to eliminate the first shark giant before the second reaches you this way. It is extremely difficult to get behind the patrolling Shark Giant without him detecting you. 
        For a video showing an easy way to kill the sharks with a monocular and a throwing knife strategy, check .
        
        
        
        Rakuyo (ËêΩËëâ) literally means "falling leaf".

        In this sense, it may have been designed under the themes of "purificiation" and "cleansing" that is associated with many Healing Church trick weapons/tools.
        However, due to Archibald's fascination with Dark Beasts, it's more likely he designed the Tonitrus as a measure to replicate the sparks these creatures could unleash.

        Reiterpallasch
        
        
        Weapon wielded by the Knights of Cainhurst. 
        Combines an elegant knight's sword with the peculiar firearm wielded by the Cainhurst order. 
        The old nobles, long-time imbibers of blood, are no strangers to the sanguine plague, and the disposal of beasts was a discrete task left to their servants, or knights, as they were called for the sake of appearances."
        
        
        
        It's found in a chest located in the entrance hall of Cainhurst Castle, where the Bound Widows are first encountered. When you first enter the room from the main entrance, run towards your two o'clock. The chest will be found in a corner.
        
        
        
        The Reiterpallasch (from German Reiter "horseback rider" and hungarian pallos [Ààp…ílo É] "sword") is a 17th century Hungarian straight sword with a typically double edged blade and guarded hilt that was used by Hungarian noble cavalry and later adapted by most western European armies.
        As pointed out in its description, the rifle spear is made "possibly in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon" (i.e. this one).
        Wynne D. Fanchon from Armored Core: For Answer; another From Software title, pilots a NEXT named Reiterpallasch.

        Rifle Spear
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. A prototype weapon serving as a simple firearm and spear, possibly created in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon. Lacks any notable functions, saving that it is the only trick weapon with an attached gun. "
        
        
        
        It can be found inside a hidden building in Old Yharnam. From the area you fight the first NPC Hunter (who wields a saw spear), drop down where the railing is missing in a corner and land on the ledges below. Go into the building and follow the stairs up; eventually you can find it stashed on a corpse tucked away in a hidden nook as you advance.
        Bought from the messengers for 4000 blood echoes after acquiring the Powder Keg Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        According to the Rifle Spear's description, it was designed as an imitation of "a lost Cainhurst weapon".
        That particular weapon may or may not be the Reiterpallasch.
        It should be noted these two weapons are the only two skill/firearm hybrids whose alternate forms utilize guns.
        The third skill/firearm hybrid weapon in this game is Simon's Bowblade, which transforms from a sword into a bow.
        The Rifle Spear is carried by a Yahar'Gul Hunter in the Cathedral Ward.
        This fight can be tricky because you first encounter a Yahar'Gul Hunter that uses a Tonitrus near the base of the stairs, and if you advance too far towards the houses, the Rifle Spear Yahar'Gul Hunter will join the fight as well.
        He also uses Ludwig's Rifle, meaning he can hit you from a considerable distance with shotgun pellets no matter what mode he uses for the Rifle Spear.

        Saw Cleaver
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used in the hunting business. 
        This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts, transforms into a long cleaver that makes use of centrifugal force. 
        The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness the more grotesquely transformed the beast."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired as a gift from the Messengers the first time you visit the Hunter's Dream.
        If you don't select it, you may buy it after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne.)
        
        
        
        The Saw Cleaver is the Trick Weapon featured on the title screen.
        It was also one of the first weapons to be revealed for this game.
        Overall the mechanisms of this weapon didn't change at all, starting all the way back when Bloodborne was still known as "Project Beast."
        According to the concept art, the Saw Cleaver uses a trigger mechanism to unlock the joint during transformation.
        The design of the Saw Cleaver seems to be inspired by multiple references:
        The transformed cleaver shows a resemblance to LB-66 MOONLIGHT from Armored Core V.
        The Japanese name is written as "nokogiri nata" („Éé„Ç≥„ÇÆ„É™Èâà) or "saw hatchet". Nokogiri is a traditional Japanese saw that cuts from the pull stroke, as opposed to the more common push stroke.
        In real life, there is a type of cleaver known as a mezzaluna ("half moon") cleaver, known for chopping/mincing up various food products.
        Most of these types of cleavers have handles on both ends.
        However, some use a single handle that stretches across the blade, which was used to chop up herbs usually; the saw cleaver follows this particular model.
        Coincidentally, the Strength/Skill/Arcane scaling at maximum level is "CDC" in their respective order.
        The CDC is an American organization designed to combat and prevent "health threats" of varying natures.
        Since the beast scourge acts like a plague (and is spread due to blood-related reasons), those who wield the Saw Cleaver can be thought of as fighting a dangerous epidemic.
        Henryk uses this weapon when he fights you and Eileen the Crow during her questline, as well as when he is summoned by you when using the Old Hunter Bell.

        Simon's Bowblade
        
        
        Choice weapon of Simon, one of the first Healing Church hunters.
        Simon despised firearms, and so the Church workshop had this specially fashioned to his liking. The large curved blade serves as a bow when transformed.
        But aside from a few close friends, Simon was scoffed at for his choice of arms, for who would dare face the beasts with a measly bow?"

        Stake Driver
        
        
        A trick weapon fashioned by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. Favored by the retired hunter Djura. 
        The stake driver, with its queerly complex design, violently drives thick stakes into the flesh of foes. 
        The stake driver allows for high-damage critical attacks, but is difficult to use and leaves its wielder wide open, but none of this should bother a mere Powder Keg."
        
        
        
        Obtain Powder Keg Hunter Badge to unlock for purchase at the Messengers for 8,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Stake Driver is exclusively wielded by Djura when he is still hostile towards you.
        His fight is tricky because the area around him is very limited, meaning you can fall to your death if you're not careful.
        Furthermore, the limited space is perfect for his choice of weapon which has a short range.
        This is modeled after the "Pile Bunker," a type of fictional weaponry which launches piston with gunpowder or explosion.
        In the Japanese version of Bloodborne, this weapon is literally called the Pile Hammer („Éë„Ç§„É´„Éè„É≥„Éû„Éº).
        It bears a striking resemblance to the "Parrying Blade" weapons seen in several "Armored Core" games.
        Has the highest charged attack multiplier out of any other weapon.

        Threaded Cane
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used by hunters on their duties. Sufficiently deadly as a rigid bladed cane, but also serves as a whip when its blade is split into many. Concealing the weapon inside the cane and flogging the beasts with the whip is partly an act of ceremony, an attempt to demonstrate to oneself that the bloodlust of the hunt will never encroach upon the soul."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired at the beginning of the game as a gift from the Messengers.
        If not selected, it is later available for purchase from the blood fountain messengers after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne).
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is used by Iosefka, Last Scholar Yurie and the Frontier Church Hunter.
        Gehrman carries a generic cane in the Workshop instead of the Threaded Cane.
        This trick weapon is possibly inspired by the sword used by Jean-Fran√ßois de Morangias in the climactic battle of French action-horror film Brotherhood of the Wolf (which bears many other similarities to Bloodborne), or the sword used by a bandit leader in the anime/manga series Claymore. Both these weapons act as a straight, double-edged sword that can transform into a segmented, bladed whip.

        However, due to Archibald's fascination with Dark Beasts, it's more likely he designed the Tonitrus as a measure to replicate the sparks these creatures could unleash.
        
        
    

        Tonitrus
        
        
        "A unique trick weapon contrived by Archibald, the infamous eccentric of the Healing Church workshop. 
        Striking this peculiar iron morning star flail like a match generates the same blue sparks that blanket a darkbeast. 
        Unfortunately, for reasons untold, the hunters of Archibald's time did not fully take to the device."
        
        
        
        Acquire the Spark Hunter Badge by defeating Darkbeast Paarl  to purchase from Messengers.
        Treasure: Yahar'gul, Unseen Village, at the top end of the road. (guarded by 2 Tainted Dogs and a Snatcher during daytime)
        
        
        
        Tonitrus is a Latin word meaning "thunder."
        The in-game description classifies this trick weapon as a morning star flail, but it's actually modeled in the form of a mace.
        The description of Archibald bears many similarities to Nikola Tesla, a famed inventor in real life who specialized in the field of electricity.
        Nikola Tesla created the Tesla Coil, a device that also bears many similarities to the Tonitrus.
        The Tonitrus also bears similarities with the aspergillum, a device used by the Roman Catholic Church to sprinkle holy water.

        Whirligig Saw
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs, and weapon of choice of the Old Hunter Valtr, the Beast Eater. 
        This weapon pummels beasts in its mace form, but its true strength lies in its attached mechanical saws.

        If you use the L2 buzzsaw attack against Orphan of Kos and hold it in place, it attempts to make an immediate counterattack for each time it gets hit by the whirring blades, only to get interrupted by the next hit. It shrieks every time it attacks, so as a result, it lets loose dozens of overlapping shriek sound effects for as long as you hold it in place.
        A whirligig is defined as a toy that is constantly spinning, such as a top or pinwheel, or as something regarded as hectic and constantly changing.
        Similar to most Powder Keg weapons sharing homage to Armored Core weapons, the Whirligig Saw is based on the Grind Blade.

        Amygdalan Arm 
        
        
        The arm of a small Amygdala Great One. 
        Strictly speaking, the Amygdalan Arm is no trick weapon of any sort, but certain madmen wield them like clubs. 
        Starts as a large, tough blunt weapon formed of bone, but when extended, the hand quivers as if it were still alive.
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare, cave at the end of the blood river to the right after getting out of the building that used to be the shortcut to the Cleric Beast in the main game. Gatling Gun Hunter dropping the Gatling Gun and a Blood-Starved Beast can be also found here. Arm is near the Blood-Starved Beast at the end of the cave.
        
        
        
        The Amygdalan Arm is a Trick Weapon in name only, considering that it is an arm obtained from Amygdala.
        The arm is remarkably small, as even the Lesser Amygdalae are huge. Perhaps it came from a newborn Amygdala.
        The arm could be the inspiration behind the Burial Blade.

        Beastly weapon wielded by Irreverent Izzy.
        Crafted by chiseling the long bones of an undead darkbeast and fastening them to the weapon. The bones are still alive, and when unleashed, grant its wielder a spurt of beastly power. 
        As flesh is flayed and blood is sprayed, the beast within awakens, and in time, the wielder of this weapon surges with both strength and feverish reverie."
        
        
        
        Ailing Loran Chalice: Layer 2 treasure room. Room is on the right when exiting the elevator from first layer boss fight, before the second layers lantern.
        Can be bought from messengers for 34000 echoes after acquisition.
        Can be bought from messengers after co-operation with player who has them. This only occurs in Hunter's dream before fight with Gehrman or Moon Presence. It is not needed to complete any Chalice Dungeons. It is unknown if this is glitch or intentional. Was patched by 1.07 or 1.08.
        
        
        
        When this weapon is equipped, your gloves will be replaced by two bone gauntlets. This can allow for the lost art of rapid glove changing if you switch your weapons really fast.
        You can charge the beasthood meter on the first windows (Gilbert) of Central Yharnam
        In the past, there was a rare glitch that allowed a player to obtain this weapon without finding it in the Chalice Dungeons.
        It has since been patched, although it isn't quite known when it was successfully patched.

        Beasthunter Saif
        
        
        A trick weapon used by the old hunters. 
        A second blade is found inside the curve of the main one. In its initial form, the saif can be wielded like a long curved sword, but when transformed, its blade is contracted, allowing for quick, repeated stabs. 
        Although this trick weapon allows for adaptive combat, it was later replaced by saws and similar weapons that were more effective at disposing of beasts."

        Beast Cutter
        
        
        A trick weapon used by Old Hunters. 
        This thick iron cleaver slices through the toughest of beast hides, and when transformed the blade splits into sections, allowing one to lash it in the fashion of a heavy whip. 
        This crude weapon relies on brute force and is regrettably inelegant, suggesting that the hunts of the earliest hunters made for horrific affairs, painted in sanguine black and reds."
        
        
        
        When walking up the stairs to the nightmare version of the Grand Cathedral, turn left onto a small platform, then roll off and walk down some rough terrain to find the weapon on a corpse.
        
        
        
        Reminds many of the Zanpakut≈ç , a fictional segmented sword that can function as a whip. It is an iconic weapon from the Bleach anime.
        The untransformed form of the weapon is a cleaver-like serrated club, and it really looks like the samoan war club "Nifo Oti".

        Blade of mercy
        
        
        A special trick weapon passed down among hunters of hunters. One of the oldest weapons of the workshop. 
        Splits into two when activated. The weapon's warped blades are forged with siderite, a rare mineral of the heavens. Most effective swift attacks,such as after a quick-stepping."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers for 40000 echoes after obtaining the Crow Hunter Badge from Eileen the Crow's quest line.
        Killing Eileen is also a way to get the weapon early in the game.
        While progressing through Eileen's quest, it's possible for her to be killed by Henryk and thus drop the Crow Hunter Badge as a result, although the quest line will end.
        
        
        
        The Blade of Mercy was originally named as "Warped Twinblades" during the Alpha test, and it was the tool of choice for the "agile" hunter.
        Both the Burial Blade and Blade of Mercy make mentions of a mineral known as siderite in their descriptions.
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite, and it seems to be the reason why arcane power has direct scaling with both blade's damage output. Due to its extraterrestrial origins, that may explain why it cannot be buffed by an external source of any sort.
        It loosely resembles the Eleum Loyce from Dark Souls 2, a sword with two blades at the front.

        This is the only effective means of expelling tainted blood, or so Brador, isolated in his cell, continued to believe."

        Return to the underground prison (from the underground corpse pile lamp, go up the stairs and turn left) and open the door to Brador's cell. His cell is the second on the left behind a flight of downward stairs. Kill Brador to obtain the bloodletter.

        A giant hammer equipped with a miniature furnace. When ignited and fired, it emits a volley of flame that explodes furiously upon impact. 
        Crush the beasts, then burn them - the brute simplicity of the Boom Hammer was favored by hunters with an acute distaste for beasts."

Be sure to shoot the explosives around the item (or act fast), as the wheelchair huntsman's corpse conceals a delayed molotov set to trigger when you try to grab the Boom Hammer, potential killing you in a huge blast.

        Burial Blade
        
        
        Trick weapon wielded by Gehrman, the first hunter." 
        A masterpiece that defined the entire array of weapons crafted at the workshop. Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens. 
        Gehrman surely saw the hunt as a dirge of farewell, wishing only that his prey might rest in peace, never again to awaken to another harrowing nightmare. "
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 60,000 Blood Echoes after defeating Gehrman, the First Hunter and acquiring the Old Hunter Badge from him.
        To make Gehrman fight you, the "Refuse" option must be selected.
        If one accepts his proposal, the game will outright end there and it will be impossible to obtain this weapon in that playthrough (not including the uncanny/lost forms found in the chalice dungeons).
        Normally, the Burial Blade can only be obtained in NG+ and beyond. However, one can bypass this by using Bold Hunter's Mark, or being killed, during The Moon Presence boss battle.
        
        
        
         The Burial Blade was the first trick weapon ever created, and it inspired others to develop new trick weapons, usually on the premise of adapting to different combat scenerios.
        Not all weapons adapt to different combat scenerios (e.g. Tonitrus), but the Burial Blade still inspired an entire series of weapons that could "transform" to satisfy different purposes.
        It was created, and exclusively wielded, by Gehrman.
        A Burial Blade can be found above the workshop table in the Hunter's Dream.
        The weapon's description mentions that "Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens."
        is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite. Due to its extraterrestrial nature, it could be the reason why it has direct scaling with arcane and cannot be tampered by external sources.
        Both the Burial Blade and the Blade of Mercy mentions the use of it in their descriptions.
        Interestingly enough, these two weapons also resemble the talons of Mergo's Wet Nurse.
        The shape of the scythe highly resembles Rurufon's scythe from Shadow Tower Abyss, an early title created by From Software as well as being recurring weapons in Souls series.
        A strange bug on rare occurrences the cape on the hunter may come off, usually in a boss fight you could notice if you dodge back and do an R1 combo the cape disappears.

        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs, and weapon of choice of the Old Hunter Valtr, the Beast Eater. 
        This weapon pummels beasts in its mace form, but its true strength lies in its attached mechanical saws. 
        These discs, lined with serrated teeth,spin rapidly, thrashing the flesh of beasts into fine shreds."
        
        
        
        From the Nightmare Church go down the stairs and follow the path. Drop down into the pools of blood of follow the path further until you reach the Cannon Executioner. Follow the left wall and turn down the path, the weapon is at the end.
        
        
        
        If you use the L2 buzzsaw attack against Orphan of Kos and hold it in place, it attempts to make an immediate counterattack for each time it gets hit by the whirring blades, only to get interrupted by the next hit. It shrieks every time it attacks, so as a result, it lets loose dozens of overlapping shriek sound effects for as long as you hold it in place.
        A whirligig is defined as a toy that is constantly spinning, such as a top or pinwheel, or as something regarded as hectic and constantly changing.
        Similar to most Powder Keg weapons sharing homage to Armored Core weapons, the Whirligig Saw is based on the Grind Blade.

        Chikage
        
        
        Foreign-made weapon wielded by the royal guards who protect Annalise, Queen of the Vilebloods at Cainhurst Castle. 
        When the intricate, rippled engraving that spans the Chikage's blade is imbrued with blood, the sword sings in scarlet hues. 
        However, the rite eats away at the wielder's very essence."
        
        
        
        Join the Cainhurst Vilebloods covenant available at Cainhurst Castle, and then purchase from the Messengers for 50,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Chikage isn't actually a katana - it is a katana/european sword hybrid. Its short crossguard resembles the one of an early viking sword, or the one of a xiphos (greek sword). The closest european crossguard shape with  this sword is the one of a Karabela (a polish sabre). In other hand, the  hilt and pommel resemble the ones of a longsword (a bit longer, to get easier katana traditional jutsu swings), while the blade shape and the 2-handed fighting style is very similar to a katana. A possible explanation for the origin of this hybrid is that the katana's design was imported to Cainhurst, where some modifications were made to create a sword similar to that commonly used by their knights.
        The Chikage is an allusion to a particular 'breed' of Katanas in the Souls games. While it is similar to both the Hiltless and Chaos Blade from Demon's Souls and Dark Souls respectively, the Chikage bears a stronger resemblance to the Magic Sword "Makoto" (also from Demon's Souls). The Makoto is the only one the bunch to actually DRAIN the user's HP over time, rather than decrease it with each successful swing.
        Chikage (ÂçÉÊôØ) literally means "Thousands Views", however if you separated the word into Chi Kage (Ë°ÄÂΩ±), it means "Blood Shadow". This could be correlated to the fact that Shadows Of Yharnam wield a similar katana with a slight  crossguard, however without using the bloodtinge.
        The transforming attack has the hunter sheathe the Chikage before unleashing a strike. This is a reference to Iaijutsu, a traditional Japanese sword technique that focuses on quick-drawing. At its finest, Iaijutse allows the warrior to unsheathe and strike at incredible speeds.
        The name seems to be a tribute to Chikage Yamamura (mentioned as a "special thanks" in credits)
        The name may also be a reference to the work "1000 Plateaus" by Giles Deluze and Felix Guattari, a famous philosophical essay about fluidity and functionality, maybe dirrectly tied to the esoteric nature of the weapons function.

        Church Pick
        
        
        One of the old trick weapons of the Healing Church, a hunting weapon formed from one of the giant picks that appear in old beast tales. 
        The Church Pick initially serves as a large sword, but when transformed functions as an extended war pick. In spite of its origins, it is a highly practical weapon."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Dropped by a hunter wearing Yahar'Gul set (presumably, this is the summonable Old Hunter Defector Antal) in one of the cells that you open with the Underground Cell Key from the Research Hall. To make this battle simple, attack him through the door with a strong R2 attack, then leave the room. He will lose sight of you and his AI will return to a standstill behind the door. Rinse and repeat until dead.
        
        
        
        The Church Pick And The Hunter's Axe both have similar appearance. When transformed, both are wielded as a polearm and have the same de-transformation attack. The only difference apart from the Church Pick having a slightly more complicated mechanism is that the Hunter's Axe is a strength-based weapon.
        A few of its attacks in the transformed mode are very similar to that of the Burial Blade.
        The Church Pick os the weapon of choice of the summonable Old Hunter NPC Defector Antal

        Holy Moonlight Sword
        
        
        An arcane sword discovered long ago by Ludwig. 
        When blue moonlight dances around the sword, and it channels the abyssal cosmos, its great blade will hurl a shadowy lightwave. 
        The Holy Moonlight Sword is synonymous with Ludwig, the Holy Blade, but few have ever set eyes on the great blade, and whatever guidance it has to offer, it seems to be of a very private, elusive sort."
        
        
        
        The Hunter's Nightmare: Found on the Underground Corpse Pile after the fight against Ludwig, The Holy Blade. Ludwig's head will be lying there and you can:
        Kill the head for the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and talk to the head. When prompted, reply "Yes" and you'll get the sword.
        Wear a piece of any church attire and reply "No", then come back later and Simon the Harrowed will be there and give you the sword.
        NOTE: This weapon is missable. If Lawrence is killed before you obtain it, you will no longer be able to talk to the head or obtain it from Simon.
        
        
        
        It seems to be another reappearance of the Moonlight Greatsword, a recurring item found around FromSoftware's games. Notable examples of such games include the first, second and third Dark Souls games, Demon's Souls, King's Field, Ninja Blade, Enchanted Arms, Armored Core, 3D Dot Game Heroes, and Otogi.
        Lore theories exist under "Ebrietas Lore".

        Hunter Axe
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used on the hunt. Retains the qualities of an axe, but offers a wider palette of attacks by transforming. Boasts a heavy blunt attack, leading to high rally potential. No matter their pasts, beasts are no more than beasts. Some choose this axe to play the part of executioner."
        
        
        
        It's possible to pick this trick weapon as a starting weapon near the beginning of Bloodborne.
        If not chosen, it can instead be purchased from the Messengers after the Hunter has found the Saw Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is wielded by Father Gascoigne.
        However, he has a moveset that is different from the Hunter's version.
        He is also capable of using his unique Hunter Pistol even while his Hunter Axe is transformed, which is impossible for the Hunter to do.
        It's also wielded by the Madara's Twin who drops Madara's Whistle when defeated.
        Another hostile hunter NPC wields this trick weapon in the Nightmare Frontier.
        It's been heavily debated by the fanbase whether the transformed mode is a halberd or poleaxe.
        Both forms utilized axe heads with a spear tip at the end (although some poleaxes used hammer heads instead).
        However, neither weapon was known to have extendable handles, which is a special trademark of the Hunter Axe.
        In either case, it's possible this trick weapon was inspired by both weapons and simply incorporated many different designs.
        While wielded in it's transformed mode if the player had a torch equipped in the off-hand beasts afraid of the fire will still recoil in fear of you as if you were brandishing the torch normally (Tested on Beast Patient)

        Kirkhammer
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. On the one side, an easily handled silver sword. On the other, a giant obtuse stone weapon, characterized by a blunt strike and extreme force of impact. The Church takes a heavy-handed, merciless stance toward the plague of beasts, an irony not lost upon the wielders of this most symbolic weapon."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased from the Messengers after acquiring the Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        A miniature of the Kirkhammer was included as the Pre-Order Bonus for Asian editions of Bloodborne. [See the Bundles page for details]
        A "kirk" is an archaic old english word meaning "church."
        This means the weapon is literately known as the Church Hammer.
        The wording also might be a nod to Nordic culture since the word "Kirk" originated from northern England and Old Norse wording.
        The etched wording on the side of the hammer part has similarities to the Old Norse alphabet.
        However, it also has similarities to the Elder Futhark, one of the oldest forms of the runic alphabet system used by Germanic tribes.
        Similar etchings can be found on gravestones all over Yharnam.
        The sword used for this weapon is very similar to the one used for Ludwig's Holy Blade.
        This suggests that the Healing Church used the method of "interchangeable parts" to efficiently mass produce weapons for their hunters.
        However, the sword used for the Kirkhammer is shorter.
        It's wielded by Alfred, should you choose to be friends with him.
        He uses this weapon as a summon.
        However, he wields the Logarius' Wheel if you find him in Cainhurst Castle under special circumstances.
        When untransformed, with the hammer part on the character's back, some cloth parts (capes etc.) of the armor can either get awkwardly stuck on it or cover it.
        Despite being labeled a 'stone weapon', the etchings, wear, and sound produced when it strikes indicate that the hammer is in fact made of metal.

        Kos Parasite
        
        
        When the carcass of Kos washed up on the coast, its insides were teeming with tiny parasites, unlike any found in humans. 
        This atypical weapon can only be clasped tight and swung, but a Kos Parasite is said to stimulate phantasms inhabiting a lumenwood"
        
        
        
        Dropped by Orphan of Kos
        
        
        
        The Kos Parasite is perhaps the most interestingly unique weapon in Bloodborne in various ways: It is one of two weapons that can reach it's full potential while using a rune (the other being Beast Claw), the weapon itself is not held, it is purely an arcane weapon, it is the only weapon directly dropped by defeating a boss, it has the highest durability of any weapon at 600 respectively, it is the only weapon to have an A-scaling of any weapon without any upgrades and is the only weapon to have an S-scaling by upgrading it twice.

        Logarius's Wheel
        
        
        "Weapon wielded by martyr Logarius' band of executioners. 
        Used to slaughter the Vilebloods in Cainhurst. Bathed in pools of their blood, and forever steeped in their ire. 
        Transform to release the power of the wheel and manifest their lingering rage in a show of utter brilliance."
        
        
        
        It can be purchased from the Messengers for 13,000 Blood Echoes after acquiring the Wheel Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        Alfred utilizes the Logarius' Wheel when found in Cainhurst Castle.
        This weapon is yet another reference to Berserk, as they are often made in Miyazaki's previous Souls games.
        "Logarius and his band of executioners" bear many similarities to Mozgus, an insanely devout man who traveled the land torturing heretics along with his disciples.
        The wheel in particular was wielded by one of his six disciples, .
        In Dark Souls, Bonewheel Skeletons are another reference to Mozgus' disciples.
        In real life, although wheels weren't typically wielded as weapons, they were commonly used as torture devices, especially during the Middle Ages.
        Torture wheels were nicknamed "breaking wheels," since victims often times would have their limbs broken during the process.
        They were also known as "catherine wheels."
         It's quite possible that Logarius' Wheel also takes some inspiration in its use as a weapon from the English folklore legend of Tom Hickathrift. Tom was a fabled giant killer who made use of a cartwheel to vanquish the Wisbech Giant (also referred to as an ogre).
        Lore theories can be found under "From Berserk to Bloodborne".

        Ludwig's Holy Blade
        
        
        A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters. It is said that the silver sword was employed by Ludwig, the first hunter of the church. When transformed, it combines with its sheath to form a greatsword. 
        It exhibits several departures from the workshop's design, suggesting that the Church anticipated much larger inhuman beasts."
        
        
        
        Can be purchased for 20,000 echoes from the Messengers after obtaining the Radiant Sword Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        This trick weapon was wielded by Ludwig, a famous hunter of the Healing Church who designed the blade based on the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        According to the description, Ludwig wielded this sword in combat instead of the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        However, in his boss fight, he wields the Holy Moonlight Sword during a certain part in the fight.
        It is possible that Ludwig wielded the Holy Moonlight Sword and his fellow hunters, inspired by the huge weapon, sought to make replicas. Unable to make a magic sword, a huge metal sheath was the compromise.
        Before the DLC's release, Ludwig's Holy Blade was thought of as From Software's traditional "Moonlight Greatsword" seen throughout various games by the fanbase.
        However, this sword was eventually revealed in the DLC to be a replica of the "true" Moonlight Greatsword in Bloodborne, the Holy Moonlight Sword.
        This isn't the first time Miyazaki used the name of classical music composers in a game.
        A boss from the first "Dark Souls" game, Dragonslayer Ornstein, is named after Leo Ornstein.
        Berlioz from "Armored Core 4" is named after Hector Berlioz.
        The normal form of this weapon is very similar to the sword used for the Kirkhammer.
        However, this sword's normal form has a slightly longer reach when compared to the Kirkhammer's blade.
        The similar nature of these swords suggests that the Healing Church used the method of interchangeable parts to quickly mass produce weapons for their hunters.
        Lore theories exist under Ebrietas Lore.

        Rakuyo
        
        
        Hunter weapon wielded by Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower. 
        A trick sword originated in the same country as the Cainhurst Chikage, only this sword feeds not off blood, but instead demands great dexterity. 
        Lady Maria was fond of this aspect of the Rakuyo, as she frowned upon blood blades, despite being a distant relative of the queen. 
        One day, she abandoned her beloved Rakuyo, casting it into a dark well, when she could stomach it no longer."
        
        
        
        Fishing Hamlet. Get to the bottom of the well. Can be reached from the underground tunnels at the end of the area or via a ladder in the well right away. In that area a Shark Giant will wander around. Fighting him makes a second one appear after the first reaches sufficiently low health. The first giant will walk over near the ladder and scream at the ceiling, causing the second one to drop. The second one drops the weapon.
        Fighting the two of them can be difficult and it is a good idea to use the Shaman Bone Blade to make them fight each other and finish off the weaker one. Molotov cocktails are also very effective against them. If neither is available to you, try to kill the one with the anchor first, as it is significantly harder to dodge.
        One easy way to beat them is use of ranged weapon like Simon's Bowblade if you are a bloodtinge build, and the Holy Moonlight Sword if you are an arcane build.
        A Threaded Cane's transformed whip can easily hit the giants from the ledge once they're lured over and begin attacking, but be sure to keep your distance after each hit. Except that there is no way to lure them over the the ledge. No ranged weapon will hit the one standing at the back and the one hanging from the ceiling doesn't drop down until the first one is at 50% health. 
        Unlike other giants in the game, these ones are easy to gun parry for a visceral attack. Keep in mind this will get very tricky after the other one starts fighting, so try to separate them and time your viscerals to get the invincibility at the right moment.
        If your range is inadequate you can use the monocular to angle a throwing knife to be able to hit the shark giant in the back. This way, you can continue from the strategy of killing them on the ledge with a gun/magic without going around. (confirmed as of January 19th, 2019)
        Chaining together backstabs is a very effecient way of dealing with them, if played right you should be able to eliminate the first shark giant before the second reaches you this way. It is extremely difficult to get behind the patrolling Shark Giant without him detecting you. 
        For a video showing an easy way to kill the sharks with a monocular and a throwing knife strategy, check .
        
        
        
        Rakuyo (ËêΩËëâ) literally means "falling leaf".
        The sword of Rakuyo bears resemblance to the "ky≈´ gunt≈ç", which was a hybrid of the sabre/katana with a handguard, used during the Russo-Japanese War.

        Reiterpallasch
        
        
        Weapon wielded by the Knights of Cainhurst. 
        Combines an elegant knight's sword with the peculiar firearm wielded by the Cainhurst order. 
        The old nobles, long-time imbibers of blood, are no strangers to the sanguine plague, and the disposal of beasts was a discrete task left to their servants, or knights, as they were called for the sake of appearances."
        
        
        
        It's found in a chest located in the entrance hall of Cainhurst Castle, where the Bound Widows are first encountered. When you first enter the room from the main entrance, run towards your two o'clock. The chest will be found in a corner.
        
        
        
        The Reiterpallasch (from German Reiter "horseback rider" and hungarian pallos [Ààp…ílo É] "sword") is a 17th century Hungarian straight sword with a typically double edged blade and guarded hilt that was used by Hungarian noble cavalry and later adapted by most western European armies.
        As pointed out in its description, the rifle spear is made "possibly in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon" (i.e. this one).
        Wynne D. Fanchon from Armored Core: For Answer; another From Software title, pilots a NEXT named Reiterpallasch.

        Rifle Spear
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. A prototype weapon serving as a simple firearm and spear, possibly created in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon. Lacks any notable functions, saving that it is the only trick weapon with an attached gun. "
        
        
        
        It can be found inside a hidden building in Old Yharnam. From the area you fight the first NPC Hunter (who wields a saw spear), drop down where the railing is missing in a corner and land on the ledges below. Go into the building and follow the stairs up; eventually you can find it stashed on a corpse tucked away in a hidden nook as you advance.
        Bought from the messengers for 4000 blood echoes after acquiring the Powder Keg Hunter Badge.
        
        
        
        According to the Rifle Spear's description, it was designed as an imitation of "a lost Cainhurst weapon".
        That particular weapon may or may not be the Reiterpallasch.
        It should be noted these two weapons are the only two skill/firearm hybrids whose alternate forms utilize guns.
        The third skill/firearm hybrid weapon in this game is Simon's Bowblade, which transforms from a sword into a bow.
        The Rifle Spear is carried by a Yahar'Gul Hunter in the Cathedral Ward.
        This fight can be tricky because you first encounter a Yahar'Gul Hunter that uses a Tonitrus near the base of the stairs, and if you advance too far towards the houses, the Rifle Spear Yahar'Gul Hunter will join the fight as well.
        He also uses Ludwig's Rifle, meaning he can hit you from a considerable distance with shotgun pellets no matter what mode he uses for the Rifle Spear.

        Saw Cleaver
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used in the hunting business. 
        This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts, transforms into a long cleaver that makes use of centrifugal force. 
        The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness the more grotesquely transformed the beast."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired as a gift from the Messengers the first time you visit the Hunter's Dream.
        If you don't select it, you may buy it after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne.)
        
        
        
        The Saw Cleaver is the Trick Weapon featured on the title screen.
        It was also one of the first weapons to be revealed for this game.
        Overall the mechanisms of this weapon didn't change at all, starting all the way back when Bloodborne was still known as "Project Beast."
        According to the concept art, the Saw Cleaver uses a trigger mechanism to unlock the joint during transformation.
        The design of the Saw Cleaver seems to be inspired by multiple references:
        The transformed cleaver shows a resemblance to LB-66 MOONLIGHT from Armored Core V.
        The Japanese name is written as "nokogiri nata" („Éé„Ç≥„ÇÆ„É™Èâà) or "saw hatchet". Nokogiri is a traditional Japanese saw that cuts from the pull stroke, as opposed to the more common push stroke.
        In real life, there is a type of cleaver known as a mezzaluna ("half moon") cleaver, known for chopping/mincing up various food products.
        Most of these types of cleavers have handles on both ends.
        However, some use a single handle that stretches across the blade, which was used to chop up herbs usually; the saw cleaver follows this particular model.
        Coincidentally, the Strength/Skill/Arcane scaling at maximum level is "CDC" in their respective order.
        The CDC is an American organization designed to combat and prevent "health threats" of varying natures.
        Since the beast scourge acts like a plague (and is spread due to blood-related reasons), those who wield the Saw Cleaver can be thought of as fighting a dangerous epidemic.
        Henryk uses this weapon when he fights you and Eileen the Crow during her questline, as well as when he is summoned by you when using the Old Hunter Bell.

        Simon's Bowblade
        
        
        Choice weapon of Simon, one of the first Healing Church hunters.
        Simon despised firearms, and so the Church workshop had this specially fashioned to his liking. The large curved blade serves as a bow when transformed.
        But aside from a few close friends, Simon was scoffed at for his choice of arms, for who would dare face the beasts with a measly bow?"
        
        
        
        Fishing Hamlet: Found on the body of Simon the Harrowed next to the Lighthouse Hut lantern after answering the first option at the Hunter's Nightmare shortcut and going through his quest-line. Interact with him as he lies on the ground to obtain the weapon.
        You may also kill Simon the Harrowed at The Hunter's Nightmare or Research Hall to obtain the weapon.

        Stake Driver
        
        
        A trick weapon fashioned by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. Favored by the retired hunter Djura. 
        The stake driver, with its queerly complex design, violently drives thick stakes into the flesh of foes. 
        The stake driver allows for high-damage critical attacks, but is difficult to use and leaves its wielder wide open, but none of this should bother a mere Powder Keg."
        
        
        
        Obtain Powder Keg Hunter Badge to unlock for purchase at the Messengers for 8,000 Blood Echoes.
        
        
        
        The Stake Driver is exclusively wielded by Djura when he is still hostile towards you.
        His fight is tricky because the area around him is very limited, meaning you can fall to your death if you're not careful.
        Furthermore, the limited space is perfect for his choice of weapon which has a short range.
        This is modeled after the "Pile Bunker," a type of fictional weaponry which launches piston with gunpowder or explosion.
        In the Japanese version of Bloodborne, this weapon is literally called the Pile Hammer („Éë„Ç§„É´„Éè„É≥„Éû„Éº).
        It bears a striking resemblance to the "Parrying Blade" weapons seen in several "Armored Core" games.
        Has the highest charged attack multiplier out of any other weapon.

        Threaded Cane
        
        
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used by hunters on their duties. Sufficiently deadly as a rigid bladed cane, but also serves as a whip when its blade is split into many. Concealing the weapon inside the cane and flogging the beasts with the whip is partly an act of ceremony, an attempt to demonstrate to oneself that the bloodlust of the hunt will never encroach upon the soul."
        
        
        
        It can be acquired at the beginning of the game as a gift from the Messengers.
        If not selected, it is later available for purchase from the blood fountain messengers after acquiring the Saw Hunter Badge in the tunnel with the giant pig (below the bridge to Father Gascoigne).
        
        
        
        This trick weapon is used by Iosefka, Last Scholar Yurie and the Frontier Church Hunter.
        Gehrman carries a generic cane in the Workshop instead of the Threaded Cane.
        This trick weapon is possibly inspired by the sword used by Jean-Fran√ßois de Morangias in the climactic battle of French action-horror film Brotherhood of the Wolf (which bears many other similarities to Bloodborne), or the sword used by a bandit leader in the anime/manga series Claymore. Both these weapons act as a straight, double-edged sword that can transform into a segmented, bladed whip.

        Unfortunately, for reasons untold, the hunters of Archibald's time did not fully take to the device."
        
        
        
        Acquire the Spark Hunter Badge by defeating Darkbeast Paarl  to purchase from Messengers.
        Treasure: Yahar'gul, Unseen Village, at the top end of the road. (guarded by 2 Tainted Dogs and a Snatcher during daytime)
        
        
        
        Tonitrus is a Latin word meaning "thunder."
        The in-game description classifies this trick weapon as a morning star flail, but it's actually modeled in the form of a mace.
        The description of Archibald bears many similarities to Nikola Tesla, a famed inventor in real life who specialized in the field of electricity.
        Nikola Tesla created the Tesla Coil, a device that also bears many similarities to the Tonitrus.
        The Tonitrus also bears similarities with the aspergillum, a device used by the Roman Catholic Church to sprinkle holy water.
        According to the description of the Spark Hunter Badge, Archibald was associated with the Healing Church.
        In this sense, it may have been designed under the themes of "purificiation" and "cleansing" that is associated with many Healing Church trick weapons/tools.
        However, due to Archibald's fascination with Dark Beasts, it's more likely he designed the Tonitrus as a measure to replicate the sparks these creatures could unleash.
        
        
    

        Whirligig Saw
        
        
        A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs, and weapon of choice of the Old Hunter Valtr, the Beast Eater. 
        This weapon pummels beasts in its mace form, but its true strength lies in its attached mechanical saws. 
        These discs, lined with serrated teeth,spin rapidly, thrashing the flesh of beasts into fine shreds."
        
        
        
        From the Nightmare Church go down the stairs and follow the path. Drop down into the pools of blood of follow the path further until you reach the Cannon Executioner. Follow the left wall and turn down the path, the weapon is at the end.
        
        
        
        If you use the L2 buzzsaw attack against Orphan of Kos and hold it in place, it attempts to make an immediate counterattack for each time it gets hit by the whirring blades, only to get interrupted by the next hit. It shrieks every time it attacks, so as a result, it lets loose dozens of overlapping shriek sound effects for as long as you hold it in place.
        A whirligig is defined as a toy that is constantly spinning, such as a top or pinwheel, or as something regarded as hectic and constantly changing.
        Similar to most Powder Keg weapons sharing homage to Armored Core weapons, the Whirligig Saw is based on the Grind Blade.
