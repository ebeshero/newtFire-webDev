<sp><speaker/><p>[opening credits]</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>rick  Isn't that something? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>morty  You were right Best day spa in the galaxy.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>rick  It's not even cruel, either.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>These things are just doing what they do in the wild It loves swallowing stressed-out creatures for 20 minutes and then puking them up.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>morty  My whole body's like a baby's ass.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>spa employee  Complimentary psychological detox? Removes all your cognitive toxins, purifies your system.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>rick  Oof, this guy on commission or something? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>morty  I don't think </p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>rick  Are you on commission? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>spa employeeWe're not on commission.  We get paid by the hour. There's no incentive really </p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>rick  Oh, my God.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Okay, listen W-W-W-We'll try the machine, but but I'd like you to try something.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Try swallowing the giant ball of snot that's dangling around in the back of your throat.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>It's disgusting.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Nobody wants to hear that.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>That's what you do.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>morty  Okay, Rick, come on.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Enough.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>rick  Man, did you hear me bite that guy's head off? Geez, I really need to chill.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>morty  Maybe you should go through twice.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>rick  All right, mister comedy man, you don't have to bust my balls.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>You're not helping things.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>morty  Rick, is this thing supposed to be making this </p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>rick  Morty! - </p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>morty  Ri-Rick - </p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>rick  Morty! </p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>morty  What happened? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>rick  We blew up, idiot! Are you really that stupid? Obviously the guy I yelled at overloaded the machine.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>It takes more than that to kill Rick and Morty, mother[bleep]! But this might do it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>rick  Run, Morty! </p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>morty  E-Everything hurts! </p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>rick  That's because you're worthless! </p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>morty  Jesus, how big was this explosion? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>rick  I'm a genius.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>I don't have time for this [bleep].</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>morty  W-W-We're in Hell, aren't we, Rick? - </p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>morty  You're so stupid, Morty.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>- You're an idiot.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>There's no such thing as Hell.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>morty  I believe you, but I just want to die.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>rick  You can die when I say so.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>I control you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>I control the universe! Why am I bragging about that? I have nothing to prove.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>I'm surrounded by inferior pieces of [bleep] and Toxins.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>We're not in Hell, Morty.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>We're in the detoxifier.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>The machine didn't blow up.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>It worked normally.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>It removed our toxins.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>We're the toxins.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Are you listening, you stupid little garbage person?! We're what got removed!! </p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>spa employee  I hope you both found that detox sufficiently relaxing.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>rick  Hey, man, listen Those comments I made about your throat? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>spa employee  It's all good.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>rick  It's nice of you to let me off the hook.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>It's still unacceptable behavior, and I do regret it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>spa employee  Believe me, man, I've been working here a long time.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>I get it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>morty  Hey, uh, you mind if I put on some music? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>rick  Not at all. Grab my terrifolds  What is that? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>morty  I just hit shuffle.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>rick  Are you kidding? -This universe. Oh, excuse me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>morty  We should listen to one random song a day, you know? We'd end up hearing more songs we didn't like, but we'd discover a lot more that we did.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>rick  That is an interesting concept.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>You know, it makes me wonder if there's an algorithmic expression that could achieve the ideal ratio.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Listen to me Trying to calculate happiness over here.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>morty  Hoo, if anyone could, Rick.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>rick  Hey, here's something no science could measure I'm real proud to be your grandpa, Morty.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>morty  Thanks, Rick.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>I love you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p/></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>rick  Yeah, mother[bleep]! Yeah! Get it! Get some! Right up your [bleep] bitch ass, you [bleep]! Guess who just discovered a new element?! You think you could do that, Morty? You think anyone but me could do that ever in a billion years? Do you think if God existed he could do it? The answer is no.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>If God exists, it's [bleep] me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>morty  Yes, Rick. I-I agree, Rick.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>rick  While you were flapping your parasitic turd holster, I discovered the toxic equivalent of electricity, Morty.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>What do you think about that? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>morty  Uh I th I think my voice is annoying.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>rick  It is, and it's your best quality.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>morty  So true.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>math teacher  Now, who can tell me the common denominator of these two factions? You don't know or y'all just bored? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>morty  Hey, listen, you know, wha If we're all bored over here, wouldn't the common denominator be you? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>math teacher  Damn, Morty. That's hilarious. Normally I would come down on any kind of disruption, but it seems to represent a positive change for your character.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Class dismissed! - </p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>kid1  Awesome, Morty! - </p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>kid2  You done good, Morty.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>kid3  Oh, yeah! Thanks for the advice, Morty.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>morty  You got it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>kid4  I did it, Morty! </p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>morty  I knew you could.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>mitch  Hey, Morty, remember yesterday when I couldn't play the trombone? Well, check this out! </p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>morty  Just like I told you, Mitch The music was in your heart the whole time.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>goth girl  Stupid hat Wish I had the courage to just be myself.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>There you are.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>jock  You might have all these idiots fooled, but I know you're still the same pathetic loser hiding behind a confident facade.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>I know that because I'm doing the same thing, brother.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>I'm not alone anymore! </p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>jessica  Hey, Morty.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Word around school is you've become super healthy.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>morty  I don't know about all that.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>I do, however, know that I have a pretty bad case of haven't taken you to dinner-itis.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Might be fatal.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>rick  Hey, kids.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Uh, hope I'm not interrupting.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Morty, a moment of your time? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>morty  Happy to help, Rick.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>rick  I hate to bug you with this, but after our morning hike I started receiving very faint, highly unusual transmissions on my sub ether phone.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Listen.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>morty  It's a bad phone. Chuck it. I downgraded to a clamshell for emergencies only.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>You know, if if if something's worth saying, I-it's worth eye contact.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>rick  Uh, I-I-I traced the source of the call back to the spa we went to, Morty.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>I thought I could hear a voice in there, so I enhanced it, a-and listen.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p/></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>rick  Hey, asshole! </p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>morty  Oh, man! </p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>rick  Remember us? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>morty  Oh, I don't like confrontation! </p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>rick  You [bleep] us, you pieces of garbage! That's right, you're [bleep] garbage, not us.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>I'm a [bleep] genius and a god.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>You really think this thing can hold me? I'm gonna rip your throat </p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p/></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>rick  Morty, what if the toxic parts of us have their own identities, their own will to live? W-What if mine shares my intelligence and devised a way to reach out to us? Sounds like he's in a lot of pain.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Lot.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>O.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Pain.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>morty  But, you know, you shouldn't have to deal with that, man.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>You know, l-let's work off your trauma with some urban spin yoga.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>It's amazing.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>You do yoga on a bike, but you have an at-risk preteen </p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>rick  I don't think I can just blow this off, Morty.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>If I had known it worked this way, I wouldn't have detoxed.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>  Well, I would have because I was toxic.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>  Now I'm detoxed and I'm accountable to my toxins, right? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>I-It's a dilemma.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>I think I know what to do.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Morty! </p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>morty  Rick! You know, the only problem here is a big fat brain that misses eating all them big fat problems.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>  Focus on the good thing.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Trust me, things are good.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Taking that away from me that wouldn't be healthy.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>  Oh, man.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>World's Greatest Grandpa, for reals.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>It's not just a coffee cup for you, bud.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>You're legit.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>[restaurant]</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>morty  I love drums.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>I never took drum lessons.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Why? Limitations.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>We are addicted to our own limitations.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>How amazing is that? Is the kale prepared in the kitchen? I'll have a water.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>  Uh How is the "cru-dite?" </p></sp>

<sp><speaker/><p>Just kidding.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>You know, you're so quiet.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>What's wrong? W-Why don't you tell me about yourself? What's the atmosphere like on planet Jessica? Where's the equator, what are the vacations, a-and the holidays? I mean, you know, are they the same time? Talk to me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>jessica  Well I like this restaurant.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>morty  Holy [bleep]! Holy [bleep]! We have a moron over here! I'm an idiot.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>I can't believe I haven't thought of this.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>You have to do this detox thing I did.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>It's an alien spa, you go through it, fwoos-s-s-ssh, lasers, bwaa-bwaa-bwaa sucks everything out.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Everything that was holding me back, everything bad, I mean, it just Right? </p></sp>

<sp><speaker/><p>Oh, my God! I can't believe this.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>morty  Yeah, phones are awful, I downgraded to I totally forgot my I have a thing, and Things are good.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker/><p>This is what dating is for, you know? First date, no sparks.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker/><p>I lied, dumbass! I lie about everything! Why would I ever re-merge with a pussy like you? So you were just gonna trap us in that tank? T-That was your plan? Not was, mother[bleep] still is.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Kill him, Rick! I don't like this! This is scary! All right, you asked for it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Did I ask for this? Did I ask for this? Huh? Did I? Assessing threat to groin.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Groin System 6000.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Kill him! That is my groin's user.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Believe me, I got a lot more use out of that thing than he ever did.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>You know what? Not my table.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>You do know me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>What the hell, Grandpa Rick? [Bleep] you, Summer! Sorry, Summer! Okay, okay, take it easy.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Don't do it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>I love you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Good boy.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Daddy's little boy.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Summer, get out of here! Go! Oh, who's that? Who's that over there? Oh, no.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>You see the bad man in front of you? You're a good little boy, you're gonna get him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>You're gonna get him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Ahh! Son of a Ahh! Nice try, asshole.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>We can resolve our issues.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>We don't need to resort to over-the-top Aah! I-I did it, Rick.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>I got the tank! I-I'm a piece of [bleep], but I got the tank! You're going in that tank, mother[bleep].</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>You're gonna live in that toxic [bleep] wasteland like I had to do! Ahh! Ow! That's right, mother You're going in that [bleep] Dads? Okay, just Just leave her out of it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>What's going on? All right, [bleep] this.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Time for plan B If I can't trap you in a toxic world, I'll just make the whole world toxic.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>It's okay, girls.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>I-I'm so sorry I put us in danger with some of my behavior.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>I-If you'd like I can go out in the g-garden, pick some fresh basil, and make us a nice Scallopini.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>What did the booger version of you mean when he said he was going to make the whole world toxic? Believe me, sweetie, that man's motivations are a mystery.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Screw that, Rick.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>We got to stop him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>What's the last thing you'd think about doing with that tank thing? Morty, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but it's not our place, you know, to pick and choose which world gets saved from what apocalypse.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Our our toxins have as much a right to their worldview as Morty, how is it healthy to slap me? Obviously my version of health is a hell of a lot different from yours, you useless old turd.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Wait.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>That's it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>How could that detox machine know the difference between healthy and sick for everything that goes through it? It can't.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>It must be by the individual's own definition of toxicity.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>That means Dad! What the What the hell, Rick? I'll explain on the way.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>This "Moon Tower," Morty, is the perfect height and metallic composition for the amplification and beaming of toxic energies.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>What do you think about that, Morty? Are you excited about that, Morty? Oh, man.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>I'm just freaked out.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>I-It's too high up here.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Once I flip this switch, the entire world is gonna be just as toxic as us, baby.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>As we praise our loving Father God is a lie! We made him up for money! Santa Claus isn't real.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>You were all mistakes! We [bleep] did it, Morty.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Put your [bleep] hands in the air.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Yeah, you little piece of [bleep].</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Remember me? Didn't you learn last time that you can't beat me? Yeah, I did.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>And then I learned something else.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>- This.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>- Ahh!! That bullet is laced with an encrypted nanobotic virus that will disintegrate your Morty in about, ah, 20 minutes.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>You think I give a [bleep]? I know you give a [bleep], dummy.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Because I know I don't.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Here's another thing I know The decryption key that neutralizes the virus.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>You want it? Come and get it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Merge with me and you'll know how to save him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Pfft.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Come on, man.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>I've been trapped in your pussy brain for 70 years of delusions, but this is the all-time weakest bluff that I've ever Ow-Ohh!! Jesus Christ! What are you doing?! He's cutting your time in half.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>10 minutes.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Ohh! It hurts! What is your problem? Oh, I had all my problems removed my entitlement, my narcissism, my crippling loneliness, my irrational attachments.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>They must be somewhere.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>They ain't over here, bro.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>I'm not going back in there! Honestly, I don't care either way.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>I hate having you in me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>And when I say "honestly" you can believe it, because we both know I'm too healthy to lie.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Watch.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>All right! Knock it off! You're not impressing anyone.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Morty, not that I give a [bleep], but are you okay? Jesus Christ, it hurts.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Relax, quit your bitching.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Y-You're gonna be fine.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Grandpa's here.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>You think that's funny? Y-You got to have a sense of humor about these things.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Oh, wait, you can't.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>You're literally incapable of seeing the bigger picture.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>I guess it's just funny because you've never done anything but complain about me being in charge, but if I ever gave you the wheel we'd be dead in five minutes.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>- Rick? - You poor, dumb, sick animal.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Rick? Ahh! Just do it! Just do it, you piece of I'm back, baby! Regular Rick! Master of both worlds! Check it it out! "Excuse me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>" Now we'll just reverse this hacky toxicity beam.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Man, I really over think shit when I'm angry.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Oh, give it to me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Mm, ma-mah.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>God is not a lie.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Mommy! Mommy! Ha! All right, Morty, now it's time we re-merge your little ass.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>You're a better man than me, Rick.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>I'm healthy enough to admit that! That kid is a real piece of [bleep].</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Y-Y-You're gonna save me, right? Part of me wanted to, Toxic Morty.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Part of me really wanted to.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>I'm telling you, these shares are hot.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Yeah.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>That sounds like a good idea.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>It's definitely a good idea.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Duane, Duane, Duane, I get it, now can you get me? Have I ever lied to you? That's right, and ask around, I never do, Duane.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Let me put this real simple.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>This stock is a beautiful redhead, recently single, not looking to date but ready to fall in love, and fate has put her locker two down from yours, Duane Two lockers down.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>So step up or step off, Duane.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Blue pill or red pill, what'll be, bro? Totally understand, Duane.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>You're the boss.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Hainholz Biotech Million and a half at thirty-three.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Heh.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>You little [bleep] monster.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Mmm! Is this organic? Mmm! Go for Morty.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Hi, Morty.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>It's Jessica.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Look, can we just talk for a minute? Is that how long it takes for Rick to trace my location? Come back, Morty.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>I miss you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>You miss the old me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>You miss someone that loved you so much you never had to love 'em back.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>How do you know I don't want to love you? Because I'm not sick.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Ex-girlfriend? Should I be jealous? There's nothing to be jealous of.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>I just realized that I'm scheduled to speak at that fundraiser on our date night.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>I can cancel.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>We'll be together.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>That's a date.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>You are the perfect man.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Oh, sweetie, I think you hit the wrong button.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>You didn't hang up.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Huh.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>How 'bout that? Sorry, tiny American Psycho, time to take the opposite of your medicine.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Do what you got to do.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Oh! Ow! Ahh! So, how do you feel, Morty? Ah, geez.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>I'm miserable.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Am I good or what? I guess it's worth it, though, to know how much you care.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Care? Me? Morty, I'm fine with you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>I only did this for him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>You lying bitch.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>She kept coming to our house, Morty, and kept asking me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>"Did did d-did you get a new Morty yet?" Because you kept drunk dialing me and crying about it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>I wasn't crying! Jacquelyn, I I-I-I wasn't who I said I was.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>You weren't a 14-year-old boy from the Midwest who ran away from his family and capitalized on his lack of conscience by becoming a stock broker? Oh.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>I guess I was pretty up front about that, wasn't I? You were up front about everything.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>You were my soul mate.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Well N Not anymore.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>I'll, um Y-You can keep the apartment, and and and, uh the drones.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>She can't keep the drones.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>They turn into a little Voltron robot.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>They're awesome.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>You can't keep the drones.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>So, how was your date with Brad? It wasn't a date.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>We were just having lunch.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>You guys are getting back together, aren't you? Morty, I need your help on an adventure.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Eh, "need" is a strong word.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>We need door stops, but a brick would work, too.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Okay.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Morty.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Good to have you back.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Have you ever been peed on before? Oh, my God.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker/><p>Yum.</p></sp>
