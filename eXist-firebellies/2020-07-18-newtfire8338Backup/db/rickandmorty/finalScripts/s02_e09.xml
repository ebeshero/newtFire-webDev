<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker><p>    I got to tell you, Rick. It’s pretty great to be in this spaceship, just the two of us, you know? Just cruising around, Rick and Morty style.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    I agree, Morty. [ Belches ] It’s nice to get back to the basics after a pretty intense, mixed-bag of a year.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker><p>    Ohh!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    Relax. That’s what windshields are for.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker><p>    I didn’t know that there were bugs out in space.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    Well, w-what did you think, Morty? Life just developed on earth by itself? Here, let me take care of this.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker><p>    Geez, Rick, that’s disgusting. I don’t want to look at that.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    Yeah, guess I’m out of fluid. L-let me find a place to stop. Hey, muchacho, does your planet have wiper fluid yet, or are you gonna freak out and start worshipping us?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Farmer</speaker><p>    The general store ought to have what you need.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    Thanks.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Farmer</speaker><p>    Of course, you’ll be wanting to be gone from here by sundown.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    Yeah, sure thing. Wait a minute. What? Why?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Farmer</speaker><p>    Sundown is when the festival begins.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker><p>    The festival?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Farmer</speaker><p>    Ooh, well, for millennia, our society has been free of crime and war, living in perfect peace.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    Oh, I know what this is! You’ve been able to sustain world peace because you have one night a year where you all run around robbing and murdering each other without consequence.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Farmer</speaker><p>    That’s right.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker><p>    What?!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    It’s like "the purge," Morty. That movie "the purge"?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Farmer</speaker><p>    Oh, have you been here before?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    No, no, but I’ve been to a few planets with the same gimmick. You know, sometimes it’s called the cleansing or the red time. There was this one world that called it just murder night. I-it’s a purge planet. They’re peaceful, and then, you know, they just purge.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker><p>    T-that’s horrible!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    Yeah. You want to check it out?</p></sp>

    <stage>Theme music♪
    [ Electricity crackling ]</stage>
            
<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    So, what do you do during the festival? You lock yourself in, or you go out and do some stuff?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>General Store Owner</speaker><p>    Oh, I do some pretty bad stuff.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    Oh, I bet you do, old timer. [ Laughs ]</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker><p>    Gee... Rick, come on. The sun is setting. W-we got to get out of here.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    All right, well, w-what do I owe you for the wiper fluid?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>General Store Owner</speaker><p>    It’s on the house. Oh, and, uh, why... why don’t you have some candy bars, as well?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    Oh, no way. That’s really nice of you.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>General Store Owner</speaker><p>    I’m a nice guy... For now.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    [ Chuckling ] Ohh, I don’t doubt it.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker><p>    Rick!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    Yeah, yeah. Hey, have a good festival, old timer.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>General Store Owner</speaker><p>    I intend to.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker><p>    Rick, unlock it!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    Just a second, Morty. Oh, look at that sunset.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker><p>    Stop screwing around.</p></sp>

    <stage>[ Click ]</stage>
    
<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    There we go. Much better. Now we can see.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker><p>    Great.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    Hey, you know what, Morty? Why don’t we christen our squeaky-clean windshield here by watching a little of this purge through it?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker><p>    What?! No! What is your problem?!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    Morty, grow up. If you don’t want to watch, don’t watch, but, you know, it’s my car. [ Belches ] Also, if you tell your mom about this, I’ll purge you.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker><p>    You’re the worst. And this planet is the worst. How can you be into this? You know, people are gonna kill each other.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    So, what, y-y-you trying to sit here and tell me that [belches] I-if... if there’s a video online with someone getting decapitated, you don’t click on it?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker><p>    No! Why... why would I do that? You do that?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    I don’t, because it would bore me. I see shit like that for breakfast, Morty. But if you don’t do it, I say it’s because you’re afraid of your own primal instincts. So you stuff them down and... [ Bell chiming ] Oh, oh! Shh. Shh. It’s starting. Oh-ho-ho! Here we go.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker><p>    I’m not watching.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    Yeah, yeah, yeah, your medal’s in the mail. I’m gonna get a closer look.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker><p>    Oh, okay, sure. And then someone’s gonna throw a rock and hit the car and then we’re gonna crash and we’re gonna be stuck down there and it’s gonna be what we deserve.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    Yawn. Whoa! [ Indistinct shouting ] Whoa, they are purging the F[Bleep] out of each other.  [ Muffled screaming ] Oh, my God! Oh [Bleep] That was... okay, yeah. T-that was gross. Wow. Man, I think my eyes were bigger than my stomach on this one, Morty. Ugh. My appetite for purge-spectating got filled pretty quick. Oh, God. [ Grunts ]</p></sp>

    <stage>[ Retching ]
    [ Woman screaming ]</stage>
            
<sp><speaker>Arthrisha</speaker><p>    Get away from me! No! No! Help! Somebody help me! Aah!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    All right, Morty. L-let’s get out of here.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker><p>    Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. W-we have to go down there.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    [ Belching ] What? Why?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker><p>    That poor girl. W-we have to save her.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    Uh, Morty, in space, we have something we call the non-interference policy. We got the wiper fluid. We watched them kill each other. We’re leaving.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker><p>    Help me save that girl, or I’m telling mom you brought me here.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    You little turd. [ Screaming ]</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Arthrisha</speaker><p>    Please! Leave me alone!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Man</speaker><p>    Leave you alone? During a purge?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Man</speaker><p>    I don’t think so, baby.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker><p>    It’s okay. We’re not gonna hurt you. My name is Morty. This is my grandpa. We’re tourists.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    Not anymore. Aah! Aah! Oh, my God. This is [Bleep] awesome! Morty, this is really cool. Hey, y-you want to help me out here and kill some people? It’s fun. We’re totally justified because we’re saving a little girl. I mean, w-w-we’re both free and clear to murder these people.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker><p>    Are you okay?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Arthrisha</speaker><p>    Yes. I have to find somewhere to hide.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker><p>    Well, you can hide with us. Rick?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    Yeah?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker><p>    Do you think we could take... w-what’s your name?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Arthrisha</speaker><p>    Arthrisha.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker><p>    Could we take arthrisha up in the ship and, you know, just wait out the purge?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    Oh, Morty, how can I refuse after all you’ve done to blackmail me?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Arthrisha</speaker><p>    Your vehicle... is it from the gods?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker><p>    No.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    Yes.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker><p>    So, uh, you know, when the purge started, did people get into it right away, or were they like, "wait, what?" This is gonna stop crime how, exactly?"</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Arthrisha</speaker><p>    Yeah, it took some time for people to accept it.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker><p>    Yeah, I bet. [ Chuckles ] I bet. Yeah, it’s kind of like cellphones, you know? At first, everyone was like, "look at those douchebags purging," and then the next thing you know, they’re like, "it’s just so convenient."</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    Geez, you working on your tight five for the comedy store, Morty?</p></sp>


<stage>scene</stage>

<sp><speaker>Jerry</speaker><p>    Whatcha doing? Watching some TV, playing on your phone?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Summer</speaker><p>    Is that a real question?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jerry</speaker><p>    Just making conversation.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Summer</speaker><p>    Are you? What part of that gives me anything to work with?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Summer</speaker><p>    My choice is to say nothing, be sarcastic, or bark "yes" like a trained animal. It’s not a conversation. You’re holding me verbally hostage.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jerry</speaker><p>    Okay, ass-face. I’ll go in the kitchen.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Summer</speaker><p>    Hey, dad.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Arthrisha</speaker><p>    I-I don’t want to answer any more purge questions.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    Haven’t you been through like 15 purges? I mean, some as a child?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Arthrisha</speaker><p>    Will somebody just help me get her?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    Fine, whatever. Morty, stay.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Arthrisha</speaker><p>    For what it’s worth, I’m sorry, but that’s not really worth anything tonight, is it?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker><p>    Y-you can’t leave us here. You’re killing us! You hear me? Come back. Y-you got to come back. Change your mind. Oh, geez.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    Morty! Aah! [Bleep] Amish bitch shot me! [ Grunts ] She tried to purge me, Morty. You let your wiener do the walking, and now I’m dead.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker><p>    Rick, she took the car!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    You [Bleep] kidding me, Morty?! She took my car and the gun. We’re like the rest of these assholes now. W-w-we’re gonna get purged, Morty. Help me up.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker><p>    Oh, geez, geez! Wait a minute, Rick. Why don’t we just use your portal gun?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    It’s in the car, dip-ass. [ Grunts ] Oh, God, it hurts. She got me right in the goddamn liver, Morty. It’s the hardest-working liver in the galaxy, Morty, and now it has a hole in it. I hope it was worth it.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker><p>    I was just trying to do right.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    Yeah, well, that’s not really the theme of tonight’s party. Heads up. Rapists. Well, don’t just stand there, Morty. Purge ‘em.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker><p>    Me?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    No, me. Should I rub my liver hole on them? Pick up a stick or something and kill them.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    We’re on a planet that’s purging, Summer. Purging. We lost our car and my gun, and we’re in a purge.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jerry</speaker><p>    Ooh, is it taddi Mason?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Summer</speaker><p>    Like the movie "the purge"?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker><p>    I’m sorry.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    There’s a pile of silverware next to you, and you throw me the one thing that can never kill anything?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    Summer, on the shelf above my workbench in the garage, there’s a red box with a keypad on it. You’re gonna take that box outside, and you’re gonna type the number I just gave you into the keypad. Got it?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Summer</speaker><p>    Got it. Is it just part of growing up to hate your dad?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    I’m ignoring you. Morty, if I can get to the top of that lighthouse, I can send the beacon, and your sister can launch our package. Just remember, if there’s people in there and they try to purge us, we got to purge them first.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker><p>    We’re not purging anyone, Rick, all right? W-will you stop it?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    Morty, if we’re gonna survive tonight, you’re gonna need to harness your repressed rage.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Lighthouse Keeper</speaker><p>    Do you have any thoughts? Notes?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker><p>    No. I-I just enjoyed it. That’s my note, you know? Please write more.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker><p>    Hey, man, we asked if we could put up a beacon... </p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Lighthouse Keeper</speaker><p>   well, you can’t. I want you out of here. You’re a petty person, and you’re insecure, and you’re taking it out on me. That’s a good script.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker><p>    What the hell?!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Lighthouse Keeper</speaker><p>    I don’t care. I want you out.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker><p>    Yes! Did you want me to weep with joy? It’s terrible!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p>    Whoa! Morty! We’re guests here.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker><p>    No, stop! That’s not fair! Just because you hate your own writing doesn’t make me a bad person!</p></sp>
