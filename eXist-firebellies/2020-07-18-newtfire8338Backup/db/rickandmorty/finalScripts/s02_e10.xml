<sp><speaker>Summer</speaker> <p>   Gross. What is that thing?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker> <p>   It’s a courier flap. It’s like the intergalactic version of u.P.S., but less off-putting. Oh, shiiit! It looks like an egg-vite from birdperson. Must be time for his annual Oscar party. And, by the way, our TV signals take light years to reach his planet. Nobody tell him that "braveheart" wins.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Birdperson</speaker> <p>   Inviting you to planet squanch for our mate-melding ceremony... blugh! [ Muffled ] </p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Tammy</speaker> <p>   If you’re from earth, that means we’re getting married!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Summer</speaker> <p>   Oh, my God! My friend Tammy’s marrying birdperson!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jerry</speaker> <p>   What the hell is a birdperson?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker> <p>   He’s Rick’s best friend.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker> <p>   Uh, l-let’s not get carried away, Morty.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Courier Flap</speaker> <p>   Would you like to rsvp or send a gift?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker> <p>   No. Weddings are basically funerals with cake. If I wanted to watch someone throw their life away, [burps] I’d hang out with Jerry all day.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Courier Flap</speaker> <p>   Affirmative! Returning to sender.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Beth</speaker> <p>   Dad, you have a friend that’s getting married. That’s a big deal.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jerry</speaker> <p>   It’s a big deal he has a friend.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker> <p>   What do you know about friendship, Jerry?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker> <p>   I assume planet squanch... 6,000 light years across the galaxy.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker> <p>   Whoa, t-that’s... that’s insane!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Beth</speaker> <p>   You’re language has the word "squanch" in it a lot. Doesn’t that become tedious and worn out, like the smurf thing?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker> <p>   Beth, squanchy culture is more contextual than literal. You just say what’s in your squanch and people understand.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Beth</speaker> <p>   Oh. Okay. I squanch my family. Uh... What, I do. I squanch my family.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Beth</speaker> <p>   Jerry, stop networking. We’re in space.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jerry</speaker> <p>   "Jerry, get a job! Jerry, don’t look for a job at an alien wedding!" I don’t get you.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Beth</speaker> <p>   This is the closest I’ve ever gotten to this part of my father’s life.I don’t want to blow it.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jerry</speaker> <p>   Okay, I get it. I’m cramping your style.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Beth</speaker> <p>   You say you get it, but I’m scared you’ll keep doing it. Look, here’s some humans you can practice on.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Pat</speaker> <p>   You must be Summer’s mom and dad.  We’re Tammy’s parents... pat and Donna guterman.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Beth</speaker> <p>   Hi. Beth. This is Jerry.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jerry</speaker> <p>   So you’re teenage daughter’s marrying a birdman. Are you guys down with that? [ Chuckles ] No pun intended.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Pat</speaker> <p>   We’re quite proud. He’s a wonderful person and an incredible bird.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jerry</speaker> <p>   Still, what is he, 40? [ Chuckles ] It’s just, you know, when he was 30, she was an actual child. When he was her age, she wasn’t born. When he was, let’s see, like, 18, she was literally in there in your womb. Imagine being pregnant with your daughter and a bird teenager comes into your home and says, "I’ll take that. I’ll have s*x with that."</p></sp>

    <stage>[ Both chuckle ]</stage>
    
<sp><speaker>Beth</speaker> <p>   Give us one second.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jerry</speaker> <p>   Oof! </p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Beth</speaker> <p> Were you born with your feet in your mouth?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jerry</speaker> <p>   I was transported here against my will in a meatball, all right? So take your attitude to the men’s section of kmart ‘cause you need to cut me some slack... S.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Beth</speaker> <p>   I want you to stand in the corner and face the corner and talk to nobody.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jerry</speaker> <p>   Maybe... I... Will.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker> <p>   You know, you’re not being very supportive of birdperson on his big day.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker> <p>   Birdperson’s big day, Morty, was at blood Ridge on glapflap’s third moon against the gromflamites! This? This is a losing battle.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker> <p>   Geez, Rick, it’s not like he’s dying. He’s getting married! I mean, what do you think’s gonna happen if you open yourself up a little bit? I mean, look around. This is your family and friends all around you, you know? Take the day off. There’s nothing to run from, nothing to fight.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Tammy</speaker> <p>   [ Whistles ] That’s his last name.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker> <p>   Good one, Morty. Excuse me, bartender. Can you make me a dumb grandson pep talk? It’s one part lame advice about stuff you know nothing about and a lot of vodka.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Bartender</speaker> <p>   Mm-hmm. I have a lot of vodka.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker> <p>   Then I’ll take one of those. I don’t need the rest.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker> <p>   God, whatever, Rick.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Beth</speaker> <p>   Oh, it sounds like you and my dad have a long history together. Wish I could say the same.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Birdperson</speaker> <p>   The road your father and I walked together is soaked deeply with the blood of both friends and enemies.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Beth</speaker> <p>   Must be nice. Um, I used to have to draw him into family photos with a crayon.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Birdperson</speaker> <p>   The war in which we fought is far from over. We live our lives in hiding.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Beth</speaker> <p>   I guess I should be happy for you. I mean, great, you guys got to hang out. I hope you had a blast.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Birdperson</speaker> <p>   The galactic government considers us terrorists. It’s unwise of me to share these details, but I’ve become inebriated.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Beth</speaker> <p>   I don’t know if you can appreciate what it means to grow up without a father, but... the guest list at this wedding includes 17 of the federation’s most wanted.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Birdperson</speaker> <p>   We have committed numerous atrocities in the name of freedom.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Beth</speaker> <p>   Annnd during that time, I don’t suppose he ever mentioned his daughter. Are those baby quiches?</p></sp>

And being nice is something stupid people do to hedge their bets. Now, I haven’t been exactly subtle about how little I trust marriage. I couldn’t make it work, and I could turn a black hole into a sun, so at a certain point, you got to ask yourself what are the odds this is legit and not just some big lie we’re all telling ourselves because we’re afraid to die alone?

The plucky little ball of water and dirt, which is where it gets its name, is dominated by seven billion primate-descended natives who love to eat spaghetti and pray to kangaroos.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Female Alien Newscastor</speaker> <p>   Spaghetti, kangaroos? I’ve got to check this place out.</p></sp>

    <stage>[ Both laugh ]</stage>
    
<sp><speaker>Alien Newscastor</speaker> <p>   Well, you can. Contact the ministry of tourism for details. Up next, teenagers are calling it [ growls and squeals] And it’s not what you think.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker> <p>   What are you... what did you do that for?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Summer</speaker> <p>   Dramatic effect.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker> <p>   Good morning, family. Oh, do I smell bacon?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Beth</speaker> <p>   Yes, we discovered a species of tiny pig off the coast of new Australia about 30 yards east. Or 300 yards west. We’d offer you some, but we hunted it to extinction for breakfast.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker> <p>   Well, I thought I’d walk to the South pole and do a little bit of exploring. If you guys need me, just yell or throw something so hard that it goes around the world and hits me.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jerry</speaker> <p>   [ Door shuts ] Okay, now that he’s gone, can we please talk about our situation?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker> <p>   Dad, you can’t talk about people behind their back. You know, it’s a small world.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jerry</speaker> <p>   Please, he’s in the South pole! And we need to have a serious conversation.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker> <p>   South pole discovered, baby! Ohhhh! Oh [Bleep] an ice cave? [Bleep] Things just keep on getting better. Wow, it’s the planet’s core.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jerry</speaker> <p>   I’m just saying, we keep acting like there’s only two options, but there’s not. So, yes, if we went back to earth, as long as Rick was out there, they’d want to interrogate us. But, and this is purely hypothetical, what if we turned your father in to the government?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Beth</speaker> <p>   Jerry, so help me God, if you ever bring this up again, no more bacon.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jerry</speaker> <p>   There already is no more bacon! This world sucks!Our life sucks! Why are we doing this for someone that would never do anything for anyone but himself?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker> <p>That’s not the point, dad! We love Rick... F-for the most part.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Summer</speaker><p> Yeah, you don’t love people in hopes of a reward, dad, you love them unconditionally.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Beth</speaker> <p>   That’s very good, kids. I’m proud of you.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jerry</speaker> <p>   Okay, so let me get this straight. For the rest of your lives, no matter how much it hurts you, no matter how much it destroys our children’s futures, we’re gonna do whatever Rick wants, whenever he wants?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>All</speaker> <p>Yes. </p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jerry</speaker> <p>   Why?!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Beth</speaker> <p>   Because I don’t want him to leave again, you dumb asshole!!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker> <p>   Hey. Uh... I was gonna hope over to the gloppydrop system, get some ice cream.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker> <p>   You... you want me to come with? I mean, don’t you need my brain waves for camouflage or something?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker> <p>   I’ll be okay. Bye, Morty.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker> <p>   Rick? You’re not leaving, right?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker> <p>   Yeah, I am. To get ice cream.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker> <p>   So, you’re coming back?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker> <p>   Morty, if you go to where there’s a bunch of ice cream and then you don’t come back, you haven’t actually gotten ice cream, you’ve just gone where ice cream is.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker> <p>   Rick, I can handle it if you go, but you’ll break mom’s heart. And I won’t forgive you for that.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker> <p>   Where’s the van, Morty?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker> <p>   It’s over the horizon in the driveway.</p></sp>

    Hi, I’m Mr. poopybutthole from episode 204.
