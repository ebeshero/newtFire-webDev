            Description:
            It’s amazing how little we know about the many forms of marine life in the ocean. Out of 230 000 species that we know of so far, it’s feasible to assume that there are many more we just don’t have on record. However, some of the freakishly unusual creatures in this list will give you a better idea of what lives beneath the ocean depths. You may have more to fear than just a simple Great White Shark after watching this.
