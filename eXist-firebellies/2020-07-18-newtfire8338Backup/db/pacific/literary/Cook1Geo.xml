               <!--Page  [unnumbered]--><l>INTRODUCTION.</l></head><p n="4">I Have in the General Introduction to this work mentioned the reasons why the
               Narratives of the several Voyages are written in the person of the Commanders, upon
               what ground liberty has been taken to introduce such sentiments as the events
               suggested to me, and what the materials were from which my work has been drawn up. It
               has also been said, that with respect to the Voyage of the Endeavour, I had still
               farther assistance, and of this I am now to give an account. </p><p n="5">On board this vessel embarked Joseph Banks Esquire, a Gentleman possessed of
               considerable landed property in Lincolnshire. He received the education of a scholar
               rather to qualify him for the enjoyments than the labours of life; yet an ardent
               desire to know more of Nature than could be learnt from books, determined him, at a
               very early age, to forego what are generally thought to be the principal advantages
               of a liberal fortune, and to apply his revenue not in procuring the pleasures of
               leisure and ease, but in the pursuit of his favourite study, through a series of
               fatigue and danger, which, in such circumstances, have very seldom been voluntarily
               incurred, Page xii except to gratify the restless and insatiable desires of avarice
               or ambition. </p><p n="6">Upon his leaving the university of Oxford, in the year 1763, he crossed the
               Atlantic, and visited the coasts of Newfoundland and Labradore. The danger,
               difficulty, and inconvenience that attend long voyages are very different in idea and
               experience; Mr. Banks however returned, undiscouraged, from his first expedition; and
               when he found that the Endeavour was equipping for a voyage to the South Seas, in
               order to observe the Transit of Venus, and afterwards attempt farther discoveries, he
               determined to embark in the expedition, that he might enrich his native country with
               a tribute of knowlege from those which have been hitherto unknown, and not without
               hope of leaving among the rude and uncultivated nations that he might discover,
               something that would render life of more value, and enrich them perhaps in a certain
               degree with the knowlege, or at least with the productions, of Europe. </p><p n="7">As he was determined to spare no expence in the execution of his plan, he
               engaged Dr. Solander to accompany him in the voyage. This Gentleman, by birth a
               Swede, was educated under the celebrated Linnaeus, from whom he brought letters of
               recommendation into England, and his merit, being soon known, he obtained an
               appointment in the British Musaeum, a public institution which was then just
               established; such a companion Mr. Banks considered as an acquisition of no small
               importance, and to his great satisfaction the event abundantly proved that Page xiii
               he was not mistaken. He also took with him two draftsmen, one to delineate views and
               figures, the other to paint such subjects of natural history as might offer; together
               with a secretary and four servants, two of whom were negroes. </p><p n="8">Mr. Banks kept an accurate and circumstantial journal of the voyage, and, soon
               after I had received that of Captain Cook from the Admiralty, was so obliging as to
               put it into my hands, with permission to take out of it whatever I thought would
               improve or embellish the narrative. This was an offer of which I gladly and
               thankfully accepted: I knew the advantage would be great, for few philosophers have
               furnished materials for accounts of voyages undertaken to discover new countries. The
               adventurers in such expeditions have generally looked only upon the great outline of
               Nature, without attending to the variety of shades within, which give life and beauty
               to the piece. </p><p n="9">The papers of Captain Cook contained a very particular account of all the
               nautical incidents of the voyage, and a very minute description of the figure and
               extent of the countries he had visited, with the bearings of the headlands and bays
               that diversify the coasts, the situation of the harbours in which shipping may obtain
               refreshments, with the depth of water wherever there were soundings; the latitudes,
               longitudes, variation of the needle, and such other particulars as lay in his
               department; and abundantly shewed him to be an excellent officer, and skilful
               navigator. Page xiv But in the papers, which were communicated to me by Mr. Banks, I
               found a great variety of incidents which had not come under the notice of Captain
               Cook, with descriptions of countries and people, their productions, manners, customs,
               religion, policy, and language, much more full and particular than were expected from
               a Gentleman whose station and office naturally turned his principal attention to
               other objects; for these particulars, therefore, besides many practical observations,
               the Public is indebted to Mr. Banks. To Mr. Banks also the Public is indebted for the
               designs of the engravings which illusstrate and adorn the account of this voyage, all
               of them, except the maps, charts, and views of the coasts as they appear at sea,
               being copied from his valuable drawings, and some of them from such as were made for
               the use of the artists at his expence. </p><p n="10">As the materials furnished by Mr. Banks were so interesting and copious, there
               arose an objection against writing an account of this voyage in the person of the
               Commander, which could have no place with respect to the others; the descriptions and
               observations of Mr. Banks would be absorbed without any distinction, in a general
               narrative given under another name: but this objection he generously over-ruled, and
               it therefore became necessary to give some account of the obligations which he has
               laid upon the Public and myself in this place. It is indeed fortunate for mankind,
               when wealth and science, and a Page xv strong inclination to exert the powers of both
               for purposes of public benefit, unite in the same person; and I cannot but
               congratulate my country upon the prospect of further pleasure and advantage from the
               same Gentleman, to whom we are indebted for so considerable a part of this narrative. </p><p n="11"><!--Page  [unnumbered]--> ERRATA. </p><p n="12">VOL. II. P. 13. l. 8. from the bottom, for Charearias, read Carcharias. P. 18.

                  went on board on the <date>27th</date>, hoisted the pennant, and took charge of the ship, which
                  then lay in the bason in Deptford Yard. She was fitted for sea with all
                  expedition; and stores and provisions being taken on board,* sailed down the river
                  on the <date>30th of July</date>,* and on the <date>13th of August</date> anchored in Plymouth Sound. </p><p n="14">While we lay here waiting for a wind, the articles of war and the act of
                  parliament were read to the ship's company, who were paid two months wages in
                  advance, and told that they were to expect no additional pay for the performance
                  of the voyage. </p><p n="15">On Friday the <date>26th of August</date>, the wind becoming fair,* we got under sail,
                  and put to sea. On the <date>31st</date>,* we saw several of the birds which the sailors call
                  Mother Carey's <pb n="2"/> Chickens,* and which they suppose to be the forerunners
                  of a storm; and on the next day we had a very hard gale, which brought us under
                  our courses, washed over-board a small boat belonging to the Boatswain, and
                  drowned three or four dozen of our poultry, which we regretted still more. </p><p n="16">*On Friday the <date>2d of September</date> we saw land, between Cape Finister and Cape
                  Ortegal, on the coast of Gallicia, in Spain;* and on the <date>5th</date>, by an observation of
                  the sun and moon, we found the latitude of Cape Finister to be <geo select="lat" n="1">42° 53′
                     N</geo>orth, and its longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">8° 46′ W</geo>est, our first meridian being
                  always supposed to pass through Greenwich; variation of the needle <geo select="lon">21° 4′
                     W</geo>est. </p><p n="17">During this course, Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander had an opportunity of
                  observing many marine animals, of which no naturalist has hitherto taken notice;
                  particularly, a new species of the Oniscus, which was found adhering to the Medusa
                  Pelagica; and an animal of an angular figure, about three inches long and one
                  thick, with a hollow passing quite through it, and a brown spot on one end, which
                  they conjectured might be its stomach; four of these adhered together by their
                  sides when they were taken, so that at first they were thought to be one animal,
                  but upon being put into a glass of water they soon separated, and swam about very
                  briskly. These animals are of a new genus, to which Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander
                  gave the name of Dagysa, from the likeness of one species of them to a gem:
                  several specimens of them were taken adhering together sometimes to the length of
                  a yard or more, and shining in the water with very beautiful colours. Another
                  animal of a new genus they also discovered, which shone in the water with colours
                  still more beautiful and vivid, and which indeed exceeded in variety and
                  brightness any thing that we had ever seen: the colouring and splendour of these
                  animals were equal to those <pb n="3"/> of an Opal, and from their resemblance to
                  that gem,* the genus was called Carcinium Opalinum. One of them lived several
                  hours in a glass of salt water, swimming about with great agility, and at every
                  motion displaying a change of colours almost infinitely various. We caught also
                  among the rigging of the ship, when we were at the distance of about ten leagues
                  from Cape Finister, several birds which have not been described by Linnaeus; they
                  were supposed to have come from Spain, and our gentlemen called the species
                  Motacilla velificans, as they said none but sailors would venture themselves on
                  board a ship that was going round the world: one of them was so exhausted that it
                  died in Mr. Banks's hand, almost as soon as it was brought to him. </p><p n="18">It was thought extraordinary that no naturalist had hitherto taken notice
                  of the Dagysa, as the sea abounds with them not twenty leagues from the coast of
                  Spain; but, unfortunately for the cause of science, there are but very few of
                  those who traverse the sea, that are either disposed or qualified to remark the
                  curiosities of which Nature has made it the repository. </p><p n="19">On the <date>12th</date> we discovered the islands of Porto Santo and Madeira, and on
                  the next day anchored in Funchiale road,* and moored with the stream-anchor: but,
                  in the night, the bend of the hawser of the stream-anchor slipped, owing to the
                  negligence of the person who had been employed to make it fast. In the morning the
                  anchor was heaved up into the boat, and carried out to the southward; but in
                  heaving it again, Mr. Weir, the master's mate, was carried overboard by the
                  buoy-rope, and went to the bottom with the anchor: the people in the ship saw the
                  accident, and got the anchor up with all possible expedition; it was however too
                  late, the body came up intangled in the buoy-rope, but it was dead. </p><p n="20"><pb n="4"/>*When the island of Madeira is first approached from the sea, it has a
                  very beautiful appearance; the sides of the hills being intirely covered with
                  vines almost as high as the eye can distinguish, and the vines are green when
                  every kind of herbage, except where they shade the ground, and here and there by
                  the sides of a rill, is intirely burnt up, which was the case at this time. </p><p n="21">*On the <date>13th</date>, about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, a boat, which our
                  sailors call the product boat, came on board from the officers of health, without
                  whose permission no person is suffered to land from on board a ship. As soon as
                  this permission was obtained, we went on shore at Funchiale, the capital of the
                  island, and proceeded directly to the house of Mr. Cheap, who is the English
                  consul there, and one of the most considerable merchants of the place. This
                  gentleman received us with the kindness of a brother, and the liberality of a
                  prince; he insisted upon our taking possession of his house, in which he furnished
                  us with every possible accommodation during our stay upon the island: he procured
                  leave for Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander to search the island for such natural
                  curiosities as they should think worth their notice; employed persons to take fish
                  and gather shells, which time would not have permitted them to collect for
                  themselves; and he provided horses and guides to take them to any part of the
                  country which they should chuse to visit. With all these advantages, however,
                  their excursions were seldom pushed farther than three miles from the town, as
                  they were only five days on shore; one of which they spent at home, in receiving
                  the honour of a visit from the governor. The season was the worst in the year for
                  their purpose, as it was neither that of plants nor insects; a few of the plants,
                  however, were procured in flower, by the kind attention of Dr. <pb n="5"/>
                  Heberden, the chief physician of the island,* and brother to Dr. Heberden of
                  London, who also gave them such specimens as he had in his possession, and a copy
                  of his Botanical Observations; containing, among other things, a particular
                  description of the trees of the island. Mr. Banks enquired after the wood which
                  has been imported into England for cabinet work, and is here called Madeira
                  mahogany: he learnt that no wood was exported from the island under that name, but
                  he found a tree called by the natives Vigniatico, the Laurus indicus of Linnaeus,
                  the wood of which cannot easily be distinguished from mahogany. Dr. Heberden has a
                  book-case in which the vigniatico and mahogany are mixed, and they are no
                  otherwise to be known from each other than by the colour, which, upon a nice
                  examination, appears to be somewhat less brown in the vigniatico than the
                  mahogany; it is therefore in the highest degree probable, that the wood known in
                  England by the name of Madeira mahogany, is the vigniatico. </p><p n="22">There is great reason to suppose that this whole island was, at some remote
                  period, thrown up by the explosion of subterraneous fire, as every stone, whether
                  whole or in fragments, that we saw upon it appeared to have been burnt, and even
                  the sand itself to be nothing more than ashes: we did not, indeed, see much of the
                  country, but the people informed us that what we did see was a very exact specimen
                  of the rest. </p><p n="23">The only article of trade in this island is wine, and the manner in which
                  it is made is so simple, that it might have been used by Noah, who is said to have
                  planted the first vineyard after the stood: the grapes are put into a square
                  wooden vessel, the dimensions of which are proportioned to the size of the
                  vineyard to which it belongs; the servants <pb n="6"/> then,* having taken off
                  their stockings and jackets, get into it, and with their feet and elbows, press
                  out as much of the juice as they can: the stalks are afterwards collected, and
                  being tied together with a rope, are put under a square piece of wood, which is
                  pressed down upon them by a lever with a stone tied to the end of it. The
                  inhabitants have made so little improvement in knowlege or art, that they have but
                  very lately brought all the fruit of a vineyard to be of one sort, by engrafting
                  their vines: there seems to be in mind as there is in matter, a kind of vis
                  inertioe, which resists the first impulse to change. He who proposes to assist the
                  artificer or the husbandman by a new application of the principles of philosophy,
                  or the powers of mechanism, will find, that his having hitherto done without them,
                  will be a stronger motive for continuing to do without them still, than any
                  advantage, however manifest and considerable, for adopting the improvement.
                  Wherever there is ignorance there is prejudice; and the common people of all
                  nations are, with respect to improvements, like the parish poor of England with
                  respect to a maintenance, for whom the law must not only make a provision, but
                  compel them to accept it, or else they will be still found begging in the streets.
                  It was therefore with great difficulty that the people of Madeira were persuaded
                  to engraft their vines, and some of them still obstinately refuse to adopt the
                  practice, though a whole vintage is very often spoiled by the number of bad grapes
                  which are mixed in the vat, and which they will not throw out, because they
                  increase the quantity of the wine: an instance of the force of habit, which is the
                  more extraordinary, as they have adopted the practice of engrafting with respect
                  to their chesnut-trees, an object of much less importance, which, however, are
                  thus brought to bear sooner than they would otherwise have done. </p><p n="24"><pb n="7"/>We saw no wheel-carriages of any sort in the place,* which perhaps is
                  not more owing to the want of ingenuity to invent them, than to the want of
                  industry to mend the roads, which, at present, it is impossible that any
                  wheel-carriage should pass: the inhabitants have horses and mules indeed,
                  excellently adapted to such ways; but their wine is, notwithstanding, brought to
                  town from the vineyards where it is made, in vessels of goat-skins, which are
                  carried by men upon their heads. The only imitation of a carriage among these
                  people is a board, made somewhat hollow in the middle, to one end of which a pole
                  is tied, by a strap of whitleather: this wretched sledge approaches about as near
                  to an English cart, as an Indian canoe to a ship's long-boat; and even this would
                  probably never have been thought of, if the English had not introduced wine
                  vessels which are too big to be carried by hand, and which, therefore, are dragged
                  about the town upon these machines. </p><p n="25">One reason, perhaps, why art and industry have done so little for Madeira
                  is, Nature's having done so much. The soil is very rich, and there is such a
                  difference of climate between the plains and the hills, that there is scarcely a
                  single object of luxury that grows either in Europe or the Indies, that might not
                  be produced here. When we went to visit Dr. Heberden, who lives upon a
                  considerable ascent, about two miles from town, we left the thermometer at 74, and
                  when we arrived at his house, we found it at 66. The hills produce, almost
                  spontaneously, walnuts, chesnuts, and apples in great abundance; and in the town
                  there are many plants which are the natives both of the East and West Indies,
                  particularly the banana, the guava, the pine-apple or anana, and the mango, which
                  flourish almost without culture. The corn of this country is of a most excellent
                  quality, large grained and very fine, and the island would produce <pb n="8"/> it
                  in great plenty;* yet most of what is consumed by the inhabitants is imported. The
                  mutton, pork, and beef are also very good; the beef in particular, which we took
                  on board here, was universally allowed to be scarcely inferior to our own; the
                  lean part was very like it, both in colour and grain, though the beasts are much
                  smaller, but the fat is as white as the fat of mutton. </p><p n="26">The town of Funchiale derives its name from Funcho, the Portuguese name for
                  fennel, which grows in great plenty upon the neighbouring rocks, and, by the
                  observation of Dr. Heberden, lies in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="2">32° 33′ 33″ N.</geo> and
                  longitude <geo select="lon" n="2">16° 49′ W</geo>. It is situated in the bottom of a bay, and though
                  larger than the extent of the island seems to deserve, is very ill built; the
                  houses of the principal inhabitants are large, those of the common people are
                  small, the streets are narrow, and worse paved than any I ever saw. The churches
                  are loaded with ornaments, among which are many pictures, and images of favourite
                  saints, but the pictures are in general wretchedly painted, and the saints are
                  dressed in laced clothes. Some of the convents are in a better taste, especially
                  that of the Franciscans, which is plain, simple, and neat in the highest degree.
                  The infirmary in particular drew our attention as a model which might be adopted
                  in other countries with great advantage. It consists of a long room, on one side
                  of which are the windows, and an altar for the convenience of administering the
                  sacrament to the sick: the other side is divided into wards, each of which is just
                  big enough to contain a bed, and neatly lined with gally-tiles; behind these
                  wards, and parallel to the room in which they stand, there runs a long gallery,
                  with which each ward communicates by a door, so that the sick may be separately
                  supplied with whatever they want without disturbing their neighbours. In this
                  convent there is also a <pb n="9"/> singular curiosity of another kind; a small
                  chapel,* the whole lining of which, both sides and ceiling, is composed of human
                  sculls and thigh bones; the thigh bones are laid across each other, and a scull is
                  placed in each of the four angles. Among the sculls one is very remarkable; the
                  upper and the lower jaw, on one side, perfectly and firmly cohere; how the
                  ossification which unites them was formed, it is not perhaps very easy to
                  conceive, but it is certain that the patient must have lived some time without
                  opening his mouth: what nourishment he received was conveyed through a hole which
                  we discovered to have been made on the other side, by forcing out some of the
                  teeth, in doing which the jaw also seems to have been injured. </p><p n="27">We visited the good Fathers of this convent on a Thursday evening, just
                  before supper-time, and they received us with great politeness; </p><p n="28">We will not ask you, said they, to sup with us, because we are not
                  prepared, but if you will come to-morrow, though it is a fast with us, we will
                  have a turkey roasted for you. This invitation, which shewed a liberality of
                  sentiment not to have been expected in a convent of Portuguese Friars at this
                  place, gratified us much, though it was not in our power to accept it. We visited
                  also a convent of nuns, dedicated to Santa Clara, and the Ladies did us the honour
                  to express a particular pleasure in seeing us there: they had heard that there
                  were great philosophers among us, and not at all knowing what were the objects of
                  philosophical knowlege, they asked us several questions that were absurd and
                  extravagant in the highest degree; one was, when it would thunder; and another,
                  whether a spring of fresh water was to be found any where within the walls of
                  their convent, of which it seems they were in great want. It will naturally be
                  supposed that our answers to such questions were neither satisfactory to <pb n="10"/> the Ladies,* nor, in their estimation, honourable to us; yet their
                  disappointment did not in the least lessen their civility, and they talked,
                  without ceasing, during the whole of our visit, which lasted about half an hour. </p><p n="29">The hills of this country are very high; the highest, Pico Ruivo, rises
                  5,068 feet, near an English mile, perpendicularly from its base, which is much
                  higher than any land that has been measured in Great Britain. The sides of these
                  hills are covered with vines to a certain height, above which there are woods of
                  chesnut and pine of immense extent, and above them forests of wild timber of
                  various kinds not known in Europe; particularly two, called by the Portuguese
                  Mirmulano and Paobranco, the leaves of both which, particularly the Paobranco, are
                  so beautiful, that these trees would be a great ornament to the gardens of Europe. </p><p n="30">The number of inhabitants in this island is supposed to be about 80,000,
                  and the custom-house duties produce a revenue to the king of Portugal of 20,000
                  pounds a-year, clear of all expences, which might easily be doubled by the product
                  of the island, exclusive of the vines, if advantage was taken of the excellence of
                  the climate, and the amazing fertility of the soil; but this object is utterly
                  neglected by the Portuguese. In the trade of the inhabitants of Madeira with
                  Lisbon the balance is against them, so that all the Portuguese money naturally
                  going thither, the currency of the island is Spanish; there are indeed a few
                  Portuguese pieces of copper, but they are so scarce that we did not see one of
                  them: the Spanish coin is of three denominations; Pistereens, worth about a
                  shilling; Bitts, worth about six pence; and Half-bitts, three pence. </p><p n="31">The tides at this place flow at the full and change of the moon, north and
                  south; the spring tides rise seven feet perpendicular, <pb n="11"/> and the neap
                  tides four.* By Dr. Heberden's observation, the variation of the compass here is
                  now <geo select="lon">15° 30′ W</geo>est, and decreasing; but I have some doubt whether he is
                  not mistaken with respect to its decrease: we found that the North point of the
                  dipping needle belonging to the Royal Society dipped <geo select="lat">77° 18″.</geo></p><p n="32">The refreshments to be had here, are water, wine, fruit of several sorts,
                  onions in plenty, and some sweetmeats; fresh meat and poultry are not to be had
                  without leave from the governor, and the payment of a very high price. </p><p n="33">We took in 270 lb. of fresh beef, and a live bullock, charged at 613 lb.
                  3,032 gallons of water, and ten tuns of wine; and in the night,* between Sunday
                  the <date>18th</date> and Monday the <date>19th of September</date>,* we set sail in prosecution of our
                  voyage. </p><p n="34">When Funchiale bore North, 13 East, at the distance of 76 miles, the
                  variation appeared by several azimuths to be <geo select="lon">16° 30′ W</geo>est. </p></div><pb n="12"/><div type="chapter" n="2"><head><l>CHAP.II.</l><l><emph rend="italic"> The Passage from Madeira to Rio de Janeiro, with some
                        account of the Country, and the Incidents that happened there.</emph></l></head><p n="35">*ON the <date>21st of September</date> we saw the islands called the Salvages, to the
                  north of the Canaries; when the principal of these bore S. ½ W. at the distance of
                  about 5 leagues we found the variation of the compass by an azimuth to be <geo select="lon">17°
                     50′</geo>. I make these islands to lie in latitude <geo select="lat">30° 11′ N</geo>orth,
                  and distant 58 leagues from Funchiale in Madeira, in the direction of S. 16 E. </p><p n="36">*On Friday the <date>23d</date> we saw the Peak of Teneriffe bearing W. by S. ½ S. and
                  found the variation of the compass to be from <geo select="lat">17° 22′</geo> to <geo select="lat">16°
                     30′</geo>. The height of this mountain, from which I took a new departure, has
                  been determined by Dr. Heberden, who has been upon it, to be 15,396 feet, which is
                  but 148 yards less than three miles, reckoning the mile at 1760 yards. Its
                  appearance at sunset was very striking; when the sun was below the horizon, and
                  the rest of the island appeared of a deep black, the mountain still reflected his
                  rays, and glowed with a warmth of colour which no painting can express. There is
                  no eruption of visible fire from it, but a heat issues from the chinks near the
                  top, too strong to be borne by the hand when it is held near them. We had received
                  from Dr. Heberden, among other favours, some salt which he collected on the top of
                  the mountain, where it is found in large quantities, and which he supposes to be
                  the true natrum or nitrum of the ancients: he gave us <pb n="13"/> also some
                  native sulphur exceedingly pure,* which he had likewise found upon the surface in
                  great plenty. </p><p n="37">On the next day, Saturday the <date>24th</date>,* we came into the north-east trade
                  wind, and on Friday the <date>30th</date> saw Bona Vista,* one of the Cape de Verd Islands; we
                  ranged the east side of it, at the distance of three or four miles from the shore,
                  till we were obliged to haul off to avoid a ledge of rocks which stretch out S. W.
                  by W. from the body, or S.E. point of the island, to the extent of a league and an
                  half. Bona Vista by our observation lies in latitude <geo select="lat" n="3">16 N</geo>. and longitude <geo select="lon" n="3">21°
                     51′ W</geo>est. </p><p n="38">On the first of October,* in latitude <geo select="lat" n="4">14° 6′ N</geo> and longitude
                  <geo select="lon" n="4">22° 10′ W</geo>. we found the variation by a very good azimuth to be
                     <geo select="lon">10° 37′ W</geo>. and the next morning it appeared to be <geo select="lon">10°</geo>.*
                  This day we found the ship five miles a-head of the log, and the next day seven.
                  On the third,* hoisted out the boat to discover whether there was a current, and
                  found one to the eastward, at the rate of three quarters of a mile an hour. </p><p n="39">During our course from Teneriffe to Bona Vista we saw great numbers of
                  flying fish, which from the cabbin windows appear beautiful beyond imagination,
                  their sides having the colour and brightness of burnished silver; when they are
                  seen from the deck they do not appear to so much advantage, because their backs
                  are of a dark colour. We also took a Shark, which proved to be the Squalus
                  Charearias of Linnaeus. </p><p n="40">Having lost the trade wind on the third, in latitude <geo select="lat" n="5">12° 14′</geo> and
                  longitude <geo select="lon" n="5">22° 10′</geo>, the wind became somewhat variable, and we had light
                  airs and calms by turns. </p><p n="41">On the seventh,* Mr. Banks went out in the boat and took what the seamen
                  call a Portuguese man of war; it is the Holothuria Physalis of Linnaeus, and a
                  species of the Mollusca.<pb n="14"/> It consisted of a small bladder about seven
                  inches long,* very much resembling the air-bladder of fishes, from the bottom of
                  which descended a number of strings, of a bright blue and red, some of them three
                  or four feet in length, which upon being touched sting like a nettle, but with
                  much more force. On the top of the bladder is a membrane which is used as a sail,
                  and turned so as to receive the wind which way soever it blows: this membrane is
                  marked in fine pink coloured veins, and the animal is in every respect an object
                  exquisitely curious and beautiful. </p><p n="42">We also took several of the shell-fishes, or testaceous animals, which are
                  always found floating upon the water, particularly the Helix Janthina and
                  Violacea; they are about the size of a snail, and are supported upon the surface
                  of the water by a small cluster of bubbles, which are filled with air and consist
                  of a tenaceous flimy substance that will not easily part with its contents; the
                  animal is oviparous, and these bubbles serve also as a nidus for its eggs. It is
                  probable that it never goes down to the bottom, nor willingly approaches any
                  shore; for the shell is exceedingly brittle, and that of few fresh water snails is
                  so thin: every shell contains about a tea-spoonful of liquor, which it easily
                  discharges upon being touched, and which is of the most beautiful red purple that
                  can be conceived. It dies linen cloth, and it may perhaps be worth enquiry, as the
                  shell is certainly found in the Mediterranean, whether it be not the Purpura of
                  the ancients. </p><p n="43">*On the <date>8th</date>, in latitude <geo select="lat" n="6">8° 25′ N</geo>orth, longitude <geo select="lon" n="6">22° 4′
                     W</geo>est, we found a current setting to the southward, which the next day in
                  latitude <geo select="lat" n="7">7° 58′</geo> longitude <geo select="lon" n="7">22° 13′</geo> shifted to the N.N.W. ¾ W.
                  at the rate of one mile and a furlong an hour. The variation here, by the mean of
                  several azimuths, appeared to be <geo select="lon">8° 39′ W</geo>est. </p><p n="44"><pb n="15"/>On the tenth, Mr. Banks shot the black-toed gull,* not yet described
                  according to Linnaeus's system; he gave it the name of Larus crepidatus: it is
                  remarkable that the dung of this bird is of a lively red, somewhat like that of
                  the liquor procured from the shells, only not so full; its principal food
                  therefore is probably the Helix just mentioned. A current to the N.W. prevailed
                  more or less till Monday the <date>24th</date>,* when we were in latitude <geo select="lat" n="8">1° 7′ N</geo>.
                  and longitude <geo select="lon" n="8">28° 50′</geo>. </p><p n="45">On the <date>25th</date>,* we crossed the line with the usual ceremonies in longitude
                     <geo select="lon">29° 30′</geo>, when, by the result of several very good azimuths, the
                  variation was <geo select="lon">2° 34′</geo>. </p><p n="46">On the <date>28th</date>, at noon,* being in the latitude of Ferdinand Noronha, and, by
                  the mean of several observations by Mr. Green and myself, in longitude <geo select="lon">32° 5′
                     16″ W.</geo> which is to the westward of it by some charts, and to the eastward
                  by others, we expected to see the island, or some of the shoals that are laid down
                  in the charts between it and the main, but we saw neither one nor the other. </p><p n="47">In the evening of the <date>29th</date>,* we observed that luminous appearance of the
                  sea which has been so often mentioned by navigators, and of which such various
                  causes have been assigned; some supposing it to be occasioned by fish, which
                  agitated the water by darting at their prey, some by the putrefaction of fish and
                  other marine animals, some by electricity, and others referring it into a great
                  variety of different causes. It appeared to emit flashes of light exactly
                  resembling those of lightning, only not so considerable, but they were so frequent
                  that sometimes eight or ten were visible almost at the same moment. We were of
                  opinion that they proceeded from some luminous animal, and upon throwing out the
                  casting net our opinion was confirmed: it brought up a species of the Medusa,
                  which when it came on <pb n="16"/> board had the appearance of metal violently
                  heated,* and emitted a white light: with these animals were taken some very small
                  crabs, of three different species, each of which gave as much light as a
                  glow-worm, though the creature was not so large by nine tenths: upon examination
                  of these animals Mr. Banks had the satisfaction to find that they were all
                  entirely new. </p><p n="48">*On Wednesday the <date>2d of November</date>, about noon, being in the latitude of
                  <geo select="lat" n="9">10° 38′ S</geo>. and longitude <geo select="lon" n="9">32° 13′ 43″ W.</geo> we passed the
                  line in which the needle at this time would have pointed due north and south,
                  without any variation: for in the morning, having decreased gradually in its
                  deviation for some days, it was no more than 18′ W. and in the afternoon it was
                  34′ East. </p><p n="49">*On the <date>6th</date>, being in latitude <geo select="lat" n="10">19° 3′ S</geo>outh, longitude <geo select="lon" n="10">35°
                     50′ W</geo>est, the colour of the water was observed to change, upon which we
                  sounded, and found ground at the depth of 32 fathoms; the lead was cast three
                  times within about four hours, without a foot difference in the depth or quality
                  of the bottom, which was coral rock, fine sand, and shells; we therefore supposed
                  that we had passed over the tail of the great shoal which is laid down in all our
                  charts by the name of Abrothos, on which Lord Anson struck soundings in his
                  passage outwards:*at four the next morning we had no ground with 100 fathom. </p><p n="50">As several articles of our stock and provisions now began to fall short, I
                  determined to put into Rio de Janeiro, rather than at any port in Brazil or
                  Falkland's Islands, knowing that it could better supply us with what we wanted,
                  and making no doubt but that we should be well received. </p><p n="51">*On the <date>8th</date>, at day-break, we saw the coast of Brazil, and about ten
                  o'clock we brought to, and spoke with a fishing-boat; <pb n="17"/> the people on
                  board told us that the land which we saw, lay to the southward of Sancto
                  Espirito,* but belonged to the captainship of that place. </p><p n="52">Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander went on board this vessel, in which they found
                  eleven men, nine of whom were Blacks; they all fished with lines, and their fresh
                  cargo, the chief part of which Mr. Banks bought, consisted of dolphins, large
                  pelagic scombers of two kinds, sea bream, and some of the fish which in the West
                  Indies are called Welshmen. Mr. Banks had taken Spanish silver with him, which he
                  imagined to be the currency of the continent, but to his great surprize the people
                  asked him for English shillings; he gave them two which he happened to have about
                  him, and it was not without some dispute that they took the rest of the money in
                  pistereens. Their business seemed to be to catch large fish at a good distance
                  from the shore, which they salted in bulk, in a place made for that purpose in the
                  middle of their boat: of this merchandize they had about two quintals on board,
                  which they offered for about 16 shillings, and would probably have sold for half
                  the money. The fresh fish, which was bought for about nineteen shillings and six
                  pence, served the whole ship's company; the salt was not wanted. </p><p n="53">The sea provision of these fishermen consisted of nothing more than a cask
                  of water, and a bag of Cassada flour, which they called Farinha de Pao, or wooden
                  flour, which indeed is a name which very well suits its taste and appearance.
                  Their water cask was large, as wide as their boat, and exactly fitted a place that
                  was made for it in the ballast; it was impossible therefore to draw out any of its
                  contents by a tap, the sides being, from the bottom to the top, wholly
                  inaccessible; neither could any be taken out by dipping a <pb n="18"/> vessel in
                  at the head,* for an opening sufficiently wide for that purpose would have
                  endangered the loss of great part of it by the rolling of the vessel: their
                  expedient to get at their water, so situated, was curious; when one of them wanted
                  to drink, he applied to his neighbour, who accompanied him to the water cask with
                  a hollow cane about three feet long, which was open at both ends; this he thrust
                  into the cask through a small hole in the top, and then, stopping the upper end
                  with the palm of his hand, drew it out; the pressure of the air against the other
                  end keeping in the water which it contained; to this end the person who wanted to
                  drink applied his mouth, and the assistant then taking his hand from the other,
                  and admitting the air above, the cane immediately parted with its contents, which
                  the drinker drew off till he was satisfied. </p><p n="54">*We stood off and on along the shore till the <date>12th</date>, and successively saw a
                  remarkable hill near Santo Espirito, then Cape St. Thomas, and then an island just
                  without Cape Trio, which in some maps is called the island of Trio, and which
                  being high, with a hollow in the middle, has the appearance of two islands when
                  seen at a distance. On this day we stood along the shor for Rio de Janeiro, and at
                  nine the next morning made sail for the harbour.* I then sent Mr. Hicks, my first
                  Lieutenant, before us in the pinnace, up to the city, to acquaint the Governor,
                  that we put in there to procure water and refreshments; and to desire the
                  assistance. of a pilot to bring us into proper anchoring ground. I continued to
                  stand up the river, trusting to Mr. Bellisle's draught, published in the Petit
                  Atlas maritime, Vol. II, N° 54, which we found very good, till five o'clock in the
                  evening, expecting the return of my Lieutenant; and just as I was about to anchor,
                  above the island of Cobras, which lies before <pb n="19"/> the city, the pinnace
                  came back without him,* having on board a Portuguese officer, but no pilot. The
                  people in the boat told me, that my Lieutenant was detained by the Viceroy till I
                  should go on shore. We came immediately to an anchor; and, almost at the same
                  time, a ten oared boat, full of soldiers, came up and kept rowing round the ship,
                  without exchanging a word: in less than a quarter of an hour, another boat came on
                  board with several of the Viceroy's officers, who asked, Whence we came; what was
                  our cargo; the number of men and guns on board; the object of our voyage, and
                  several other questions, which we directly and truly answered: they then told me,
                  as a kind of apology for detaining my Lieutenant, and putting an officer on board
                  my pinnace, that it was the invariable custom of the place, to detain the first
                  officer who came on shore from any ship on her arrival, till a boat from the
                  Viceroy had visited her, and to suffer no boat to go either from or to a ship,
                  while she lay there, without having a soldier on board. They said that I might go
                  on shore when I pleased; but wished that every other person might remain on board
                  till the paper which they should draw up had been delivered to the Viceroy,
                  promising that, immediately upon their return, the Lieutenant should be sent on
                  board. </p><p n="55">This promise was performed; and, on the next morning,* the <date>14th</date>, I went on
                  shore, and obtained leave of the Viceroy to purchase provisions and refreshments
                  for the ship, provided I would employ one of their own people as a factor, but not
                  otherwise. I made some objections to this, but he insisted upon it as the custom
                  of the place. I objected also against the putting a soldier into the boat every
                  time she went between the ship and the shore; but he told me, that this was done
                  by the express orders of his court, with which he could in no case dispense. I
                  then requested, that the Gentlemen <pb n="20"/> whom I had on board might reside
                  on shore during our stay,* and that Mr. Banks might go up the country to gather
                  plants; but this he absolutely refused. I judged from his extreme caution, and the
                  severity of these restrictions, that he suspected we were come to trade; I
                  therefore took some pains to convince him of the contrary. I told him, that we
                  were bound to the southward, by the order of his Britannic Majesty, to observe a
                  transit of the planet Venus over the Sun, an astronomical phaenomenon of great
                  importance to navigation. Of the transit of Venus, however, he could form no other
                  conception, than that it was the passing of the North Star through the South Pole;
                  for these are the very words of his interpreter, who was a Swede, and spoke
                  English very well. I did not think it necessary to ask permission for the
                  Gentlemen to come on shore during the day, or that, when I was on shore myself, I
                  might be at liberty, taking for granted that nothing was intended to the contrary;
                  but in this I was unfortunately mistaken. As soon as I took leave of his
                  Excellency, I found an officer who had orders to attend me wherever I went: of
                  this I desired an explanation, and was told that it was meant as a compliment; I
                  earnestly desired to be excused from accepting such an honour, but the good
                  Viceroy would by no means suffer it to be dispensed with. </p><p n="56">With this officer, therefore, I returned on board, about twelve o'clock,
                  where I was impatiently expected by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, who made no doubt
                  but that a fair account of us having been given by the officers who had been on
                  board the evening before, in their paper called a Practica, and every scruple of
                  the Viceroy removed in my conference with his Excellency, they should immediately
                  be at liberty to go on shore, and dispose of themselves as they pleased. Their
                  disappointment at receiving my report may <pb n="21"/> easily be conceived; and it
                  was still increased by an account,* that it had been resolved, not only to prevent
                  their residing on shore, and going up the country, but even their leaving the
                  ship; orders having been given, that no person except the Captain, and such common
                  sailors as were required to be upon duty, should be permitted to land; and that
                  there was probably a particular view to the passengers in this prohibition, as
                  they were reported to be Gentlemen sent abroad to make observations and
                  discoveries, and were uncommonly qualified for that purpose. In the evening,
                  however, Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander dressed themselves, and attempted to go on
                  shore, in order to make a visit to the Viceroy; but they were stopped by the
                  guard-boat which had come off with our pinnace, and which kept hovering round the
                  ship all the while she lay here, for that purpose; the officer on board saying,
                  that he had particular orders, which he could not disobey, to suffer no passenger,
                  nor any officer, except the Captain, to pass the boat. After much expostulation to
                  no purpose, they were obliged, with whatever reluctance and mortification, to
                  return on board. I then went on shore myself, but found the Viceroy inflexible; he
                  had one answer ready for every thing I could say, That the restrictions under
                  which he had laid us, were in obedience to the King of Portugal's commands, and
                  therefore indispensible. </p><p n="57">In this situation I determined, rather than be made a prisoner in my own
                  boat, to go on shore no more; for the officer who, under pretence of a compliment,
                  attended me when I was ashore, insisted also upon going with me to and from the
                  ship: but still imagining, that the scrupulous vigilance of the Viceroy must
                  proceed from some mistaken notion about us, which might more easily be removed by
                  writing than in conversation, I drew up a memorial, and Mr. Banks drew up another,
                  which we sent on shore. These memorials <pb n="22"/> were both answered,* but by
                  no means to our satisfaction; we therefore replied: in consequence of which,
                  several other papers were interchanged between us and the Viceroy, but still
                  without effect. However, as I thought some degree of force, on the part of the
                  Viceroy, to enforce these restrictions, necessary to justify my acquiescence in
                  them to the admiralty; I gave orders to my Lieutenant, Mr. Hicks, when I sent him
                  with our last reply on Sunday the <date>20th</date>,* in the evening, not to suffer a guard to
                  be put into his boat. When the officer on board the guard-boat found that Mr.
                  Hicks was determined to obey my orders, he did not proceed to force, but attended
                  him to the landing-place, and reported the matter to the Viceroy. Upon this his
                  Excellency refused to receive the memorial, and ordered Mr. Hicks to return to the
                  ship; when he came back to the boat, he found that a guard had been put on board
                  in his absence, but he absolutely refused to return till the soldier was removed:
                  the officer then proceeded to enforce the Viceroy's orders; he seized all the
                  boat's crew, and sent them under an armed force to prison, putting Mr. Hicks at
                  the same time into one of their own boats, and sending him under a guard back to
                  the ship. As soon as he had reported these particulars, I wrote again to the
                  Viceroy, demanding my boat and crew, and in my letter inclosed the memorial which
                  he had refused to receive from Mr. Hicks: these papers I sent by a petty officer,
                  that I might wave the dispute about a guard, against which I had never objected
                  except when there was a commissioned officer on board the boat. The petty officer
                  was permitted to go on shore with his guard, and, having delivered his letter, was
                  told that an answer would be sent the next day. </p><p n="58">About eight o'clock this evening it began to blow very hard in sudden gusts
                  from the South, and our long-boat <pb n="23"/> coming on board just at this time
                  with four pipes of rum,* the rope which was thrown to her from the ship, and which
                  was taken hold of by the people on board, unfortunately broke, and the boat, which
                  had come to the ship before the wind, went adrift to windward of her, with a small
                  skiff of Mr. Banks's that was fastened to her stern. This was a great misfortune,
                  as the pinnace being detained on shore, we had no boat on board but a four oar'd
                  yawl: the yawl, however, was immediately manned and sent to her assistance; but,
                  notwithstanding the utmost effort of the people in both boats, they were very soon
                  out of sight: far indeed we could not see at that time in the evening, but the
                  distance was enough to convince us that they were not under command, which gave us
                  great uneasiness, as we knew they must drive directly upon a reef of rocks which
                  ran out just to leeward of where we lay: after waiting some hours in the utmost
                  anxiety, we gave them over for lost, but about three o'clock the next morning had
                  the satisfaction to see all the people come on board in the yawl. From them we
                  learnt,* that the long-boat having filled with water, they had brought her to a
                  grappling and left her; and that, having fallen in with the reef of rocks in their
                  return to the ship, they had been obliged to cut Mr. Banks's little boat adrift.
                  As the loss of our long-boat, which we had now too much reason to apprehend, would
                  have been an unspeakable disadvantage to us, considering the nature of our
                  expedition, I sent another letter to the Viceroy, as soon as I thought he could be
                  seen, acquainting him with our misfortune, and requesting the assistance of a boat
                  from the shore for the recovery of our own; I also renewed my demand that the
                  pinnace and her crew should be no longer detained: after some delay, his
                  Excellency thought sit to comply both with my request and demand; and the same day
                  we happily recovered both the <pb n="24"/> long-boat and skiff,* with the rum, but
                  every thing else that was on board was lost. On the <date>23d</date>, the Viceroy, in his
                  answer to my remonstrance against seizing my men and detaining the boat,
                  acknowledged that I had been treated with some incivility, but said that the
                  resistance of my officers, to what he had declared to be the King's orders, made
                  it absolutely necessary; he also expressed some doubts whether the Endeavour,
                  considering her structure and other circumstances, was in the service of his
                  Majesty, though I had before shewed him my commission: to this I answered in
                  writing, That to remove all scruples, I was ready to produce my commission again.
                  His Excellency's scruples however still remained, and in his reply to my letter he
                  not only expressed them in still plainer terms, but accused my people of
                  smuggling. This charge, I am confident, was without the least foundation in truth.
                  Mr. Banks's servants had indeed found means to go on shore on the <date>22d</date> at
                  day-break, and stay till it was dark in the evening, but they brought on board
                  only plants and insects, having been sent for no other purpose. And I had the
                  greatest reason to believe that not a single article was smuggled by any of our
                  people who were admitted on shore, though many artful means were used to tempt
                  them even by the very officers that were under his Excellency's roof, which made
                  the charge still more injurious and provoking. I have indeed some reason to
                  suspect that one poor fellow bought a single bottle of rum with some of the
                  clothes upon his back; and in my answer I requested of his Excellency, that, if
                  such an attempt at illicit trade should be repeated, he would without scruple
                  order the offender to be taken into custody. And thus ended our altercation, both
                  by conference and writing, with the Viceroy of Rio de Janeiro. </p><p n="59"><pb n="25"/>A friar in the town having requested the assistance of our surgeon,*
                  Dr. Solander easily got admittance in that character on the <date>25th</date>,* and received
                  many marks of civility from the people. On the <date>26th</date>, before day-break,* Mr. Banks
                  also found means to elude the vigilance of the people in the guard-boat, and got
                  on shore; he did not however go into the town, for the principal objects of his
                  curiosity were to be found in the fields: to him also the people behaved with
                  great civility, many of them invited him to their houses, and he bought a porker
                  and some other things of them for the ship's company; the porker, which was by no
                  means lean, cost him eleven shillings, and he paid something less than two for a
                  Muscovy duck. </p><p n="60">On the <date>27th</date>, when the boats returned from watering,* the people told us
                  there was a report in town, that search was making after some persons who had been
                  on shore from the ship without the Viceroy's permission; these persons we
                  conjectured to be Dr. Solander and Mr. Banks, and therefore they determined to go
                  on shore no more. </p><p n="61">On the <date>1st of December</date>,* having got our water and other necessaries on
                  board, I sent to the Viceroy for a pilot to carry us to sea, who came off to us;
                  but the wind preventing us from getting out, we took on board a plentiful supply
                  of fresh beef, yams and greens for the ship's company. On the <date>2d</date>, a Spanish packet
                  arrived,* with letters from Buenos Ayres for Spain, commanded by Don Antonio de
                  Monte Negro y Velasco, who with great politeness offered to take our letters to
                  Europe: I accepted the favour, and gave him a packet for the Secretary of the
                  Admiralty, containing copies of all the papers that had passed between me and the
                  Viceroy; leaving also duplicates with the Viceroy, to be by him forwarded to
                  Lisbon. </p><p n="62"><pb n="26"/>*On Monday the <date>5th</date>, it being a dead calm, we weighed anchor and towed
                  down the bay; but, to our great astonishment, when we got abreast of Santa Cruz,
                  the principal fortification, two shot were fired at us. We immediately cast
                  anchor, and sent to the fort to enquire the reason of what had happened: our
                  people brought us word, That the Commandant had received no order from the Viceroy
                  to let us pass; and that, without such an order, no vessel was ever suffered to go
                  below the fort. It was now, therefore, become necessary that we should send to the
                  Viceroy, to enquire why the necessary order had not been given, as he had notice
                  of our departure, and had thought fit to write me a polite letter, wishing me a
                  good voyage. Our messenger soon returned with an account, that the order had been
                  written some days, but by an unaccountable negligence not sent. </p><p n="63">*We did not get under sail till the <date>7th</date>; and, when we had passed the fort,
                  the pilot desired to be discharged. As soon as he was dismissed, we were left by
                  our guard-boat, which had hovered about us from the first hour of our being in
                  this place to the last: and Mr. Banks, having been prevented from going ashore at
                  Rio de Janeiro, availed himself of her departure to examine the neighbouring
                  islands, where, particularly on one in the mouth of the harbour called Raza, he
                  gathered many species of plants, and caught a variety of insects. </p><p n="64">It is remarkable, that, during the last three or four days of our staying
                  in this harbour, the air was loaded with butterflies: they were chiefly of one
                  sort, but in such numbers that thousands were in view in every direction, and the
                  greatest part of them above our mast-head. </p><p n="65">We lay here from the <date>14th of November</date> to the <date>7th of December</date>, something
                  more than three weeks, during which <pb n="27"/> time Mr. Monkhouse, our Surgeon,*
                  was on shore every day to buy our provisions; Dr. Solander was on shore once; I
                  was several times on shore myself, and Mr. Banks also found means to get into the
                  country, notwithstanding the watch that was set over us. I shall, therefore, with
                  the intelligence obtained from these Gentlemen, and my own observations, give some
                  account of the town, and the country adjacent. </p><p n="66">Rio de Janeiro, or the river of Januarius, was probably so called from its
                  having been discovered on the feast-day of that saint; and the town, which is the
                  capital of the Portuguese dominions in America, derives its name from the river,
                  which indeed is rather an arm of the sea, for it did not appear to receive any
                  considerable stream of fresh water: it stands on a plain, close to the shore, on
                  the west side of the bay, at the foot of several high mountains which rise behind
                  it. It is neither ill designed nor ill built; the houses, in general, are of
                  stone, and two stories high; every house having, after the manner of the
                  Portuguese, a little balcony before its windows, and a lattice of wood before the
                  balcony. I computed its circuit to be about three miles; for it appears to be
                  equal in size to the largest country towns in England, Bristol and Liverpool not
                  excepted; the streets are straight, and of a convenient breadth, intersecting each
                  other at right angles; the greater part, however, lie in a line with the citadel,
                  called St. Sebastian, which stands on the top of a hill that commands the town. </p><p n="67">It is supplied with water from the neighbouring hills, by an aqueduct,
                  which is raised upon two stories of arches, and is said in some places to be at a
                  great height from the ground, from which the water is conveyed by pipes into a
                  fountain in the great square that exactly fronts the Viceroy's palace. At this
                  fountain great numbers of people are <pb n="28"/> continually waiting for their
                  turn to draw water;* and the soldiers, who are posted at the Governor's door, find
                  it very difficult to maintain any regularity among them. The water at this
                  fountain however is so bad, that we, who had been two months at sea, confined to
                  that in our casks, which was almost always foul, could not drink it with pleasure.
                  Water of a better quality is laid into some other part of the town, but I could
                  not learn by what means. </p><p n="68">The churches are very fine, and there is more religious parade in this
                  place than in any of the Popish countries in Europe: there is a procession of some
                  parish every day, with various insignia, all splendid and costly in the highest
                  degree: they beg money, and say prayers in great form, at the corner of every
                  street. </p><p n="69">While we lay here, one of the churches was rebuilding; and to defray the
                  expence, the parish to which it belonged had leave to beg in procession through
                  the whole city once a week, by which very considerable sums were collected. At
                  this ceremony, which was performed by night, all the boys of a certain age were
                  obliged to assist, the sons of Gentlemen not being excused. Each of these boys was
                  dressed in a black cassock, with a short red cloak, hanging about as low as the
                  waist, and carried in his hand a pole about six or seven feet long, at the end of
                  which was tied a lantern: the number of lanterns was generally above two hundred,
                  and the light they gave was so great, that the people who saw it from the cabbin
                  windows thought the town had been on fire. </p><p n="70">The inhabitants, however, may pay their devotions at the shrine of any
                  saint in the calendar, without waiting till there is a procession; for before
                  almost every house there is a little cupboard, furnished with a glass window, in
                  which one of these tutelary powers is waiting to be gracious; and to prevent <pb n="29"/> his being out of mind, by being out of sight,* a lamp is kept
                  constantly burning before the window of his tabernacle in the night. The people
                  indeed are by no means remiss in their devotions, for before these saints they
                  pray and sing hymns with such vehemence, that in the night they were very
                  distinctly heard on board the ship, though she lay at the distance of at least
                  half a mile from the town. </p><p n="71">The government here, as to its form, is mixed; it is notwithstanding very
                  despotic in fact. It consists of the Viceroy, the Governor of the town, and a
                  council, the number of which I could not learn: without the consent of this
                  council, in which the Viceroy has a casting vote, no judicial act should be
                  performed; yet both the Viceroy and Governor frequently commit persons to prison
                  at their own pleasure, and sometimes send them to Lisbon, without acquainting
                  their friends or family with what is laid to their charge, or where they may be
                  found. </p><p n="72">To restrain the people from travelling into the country, and getting into
                  any district where gold or diamonds may be found, of both which there is much more
                  than the government can otherwise secure, certain bounds are prescribed them, at
                  the discretion of the Viceroy, sometimes at a few, and sometimes at many miles
                  distance from the city. On the verge of these limits a guard constantly patroles,
                  and whoever is found beyond it, is immediately seized and thrown into prison: and
                  if a man is, upon any pretence, taken up by the guard within the limits, he will
                  be sent to prison, tho' it should appear that he did not know their extent. </p><p n="73">The inhabitants, which are very numerous, consist of Portuguese, Negroes,
                  and Indians, the original natives of the country. The township of Rio, which, as I
                  was told, is but a small part of the Capitanea, or province, is said to contain
                     <pb n="30"/> 37,000 White persons,* and 629,000 Blacks, many of whom are free;
                  making together 666,000, in the proportion of seventeen to one. The Indians, who
                  are employed to do the King's work in this neighbourhood, can scarcely be
                  considered as inhabitants; their residence is at a distance, from whence they come
                  by turns to their task, which they are obliged to perform for a small pay. The
                  guard-boat was constantly rowed by these people, who are of a light copper colour,
                  and have long black hair. </p><p n="74">The military establishment here consists of twelve regiments of regular
                  troops, six of which are Portuguese and six Creoles; and twelve other regiments of
                  provincial militia. To the regulars the inhabitants behave with the utmost
                  humility and submission; and I was told, that if any of them should neglect to
                  take off his hat upon meeting an officer, he would immediately be knocked down.
                  These haughty severities render the people extremely civil to any stranger who has
                  the appearance of a Gentleman. But the subordination of the officers themselves to
                  the Viceroy is enforced with circumstances equally mortifying, for they are
                  obliged to attend in his hall three times every day to ask his commands: the
                  answer constantly is, "There is nothing new." I have been told, that this servile
                  attendance is exacted to prevent their going into the country; and if so, it
                  effectually answers the purpose. </p><p n="75">It is, I believe, universally allowed, that the women, both of the Spanish
                  and Portuguese settlements in South America, make less difficulty of granting
                  personal favours, than those of any other civilized country in the world. Of the
                  Ladies of this town some have formed so unfavourable an opinion as to declare,
                  that they did not believe there was a modest one among them. This censure is
                  certainly too general; <pb n="31"/> but what Dr. Solander saw of them when he was
                  on shore, gave him no very exalted idea of their chastity:* he told me, that as
                  soon as it was dark, one or more of them appeared in every window, and
                  distinguished those whom they liked, among the Gentlemen that walked past them, by
                  giving them nosegays; that he, and two Gentlemen who were with him, received so
                  many of these favours, that, at the end of their walk, which was not a long one,
                  they threw whole hatfuls of them away. Great allowance must certainly be made for
                  local customs; that which in one country would be an indecent familiarity, is a
                  mere act of general courtesy in another; of the fact, therefore, which I have
                  related, I shall say nothing, but that I am confident it is true. </p><p n="76">Neither will I take upon me to affirm, that murders are frequently
                  committed here; but the churches afford an asylum to the criminal: and as our
                  cockswain was one day looking at two men, who appeared to be talking together in a
                  friendly manner, one of them suddenly drew a knife and stabbed the other; who not
                  instantly falling, the murderer withdrew the weapon, and stabbed him a second
                  time. He then ran away, and was pursued by some Negroes who were also witnesses of
                  the fact; but whether he escaped or was taken I never heard. </p><p n="77">The country, at a small distance round the town, which is all that any of
                  us saw, is beautiful in the highest degree; the wildest spots being varied with a
                  greater luxuriance of flowers, both as to number and beauty, than the best gardens
                  in England. </p><p n="78">Upon the trees and bushes sat an almost endless variety of birds,
                  especially small ones, many of them covered with the most elegant plumage; among
                  which were the hummingbird. <pb n="32"/> Of insects too there was a great
                  variety,* and some of them very beautiful; but they were much more nimble than
                  those of Europe, especially the butterflies, most of which flew near the tops of
                  the trees, and were therefore very difficult to be caught, except when the sea
                  breeze blew fresh, which kept them nearer to the ground. </p><p n="79">The banks of the sea, and of the small brooks which water this part of the
                  country, are almost covered with the small crabs called Cancer vocans; some of
                  these had one of the claws, called by naturalists the hand, very large; others had
                  them both remarkably small, and of equal size, a difference which is said to
                  distinguish the sexes, that with the large claw being the male. </p><p n="80">There is the appearance of but little cultivation; the greater part of the
                  land is wholly uncultivated, and very little care and labour seem to have been
                  bestowed upon the rest; there are indeed little patches or gardens, in which many
                  kinds of European garden stuff are produced, particularly cabbages, peas, beans,
                  kidney-beans, turnips, and white radishes, but all much inferior to our own: water
                  melons and pine apples are also produced in these spots, and they are the only
                  fruits that we saw cultivated, though the country produces musk melons, oranges,
                  limes, lemons, sweet lemons, citrons, plantains, bananas, mangos, mamane apples,
                  acajou or cashou apples and nuts; jamboira of two kinds, one of which bears a
                  small black fruit; cocoa nuts, mangos, palm nuts of two kinds, one long, the other
                  round; and palm berries, all which were in season while we were there. </p><p n="81">Of these fruits the water melons and oranges are the best in their kind;
                  the pine apples are much inferior to those that I have eaten in England; they are
                  indeed more juicy <pb n="33"/> and sweet, but have no flavour;* I believe them to
                  be natives of this country, though we heard of none that at this time grow wild;
                  they have, however, very little care bestowed upon them, the plants being set
                  between beds of any kind of garden-stuff, and suffered to take the chance of the
                  season. The melons are still worse, at least those that we tasted, which were
                  mealy and insipid; but the water melons are excellent; they have a flavour, at
                  least a degree of acidity, which ours have not. We saw also several species of the
                  prickle pear, and some European fruits, particularly the apple and peach, both
                  which were very mealy and insipid. In these gardens also grow yams, and mandihoca,
                  which in the West Indies is called Cassada or Cassava, and to the flour of which
                  the people here, as I have before observed, give the name of Farinha de Pao, which
                  may not improperly be translated, Powder of post. The soil, though it produces
                  tobacco and sugar, will not produce bread-corn; so that the people here have no
                  wheat-flour, but what is brought from Portugal, and sold at the rate of a shilling
                  a pound, though it is generally spoiled by being heated in its passage. Mr. Banks
                  is of opinion, that all the products of our West Indian islands would grow here;
                  notwithstanding which, the inhabitants import their coffee and chocolate from
                  Lisbon. </p><p n="82">Most of the land, as far as we saw of the country, is laid down in grass,
                  upon which cattle are pastured in great plenty; but they are so lean, that an
                  Englishman will scarcely eat of their flesh: the herbage of these pastures
                  consists principally of cresses, and consequently is so short, that though it may
                  afford a bite for horses and sheep, it can scarcely be grazed by horned cattle in
                  a sufficient quantity to keep them alive. </p><p n="83">This country may possibly produce many valuable drugs; but we could not
                  find any in the apothecaries shops, except <pb n="34"/> pareira brava,* and balsam
                  capivi; both of which were excellent in their kind, and sold at a very low price.
                  The drug trade is probably carried on to the northward, as well as that of the
                  dying woods, for we could get no intelligence of either of them here. </p><p n="84">As to manufactures, we neither saw nor heard of any, except that of cotton
                  hammocks, in which people are carried about here, as they are with us in sedan
                  chairs; and these are principally, if not wholly, fabricated by the Indians. </p><p n="85">The riches of the place consists chiefly in the mines, which we supposed to
                  lie far up the country, though we could never learn where, or at what distance;
                  for the situation is concealed as much as possible, and troops are continually
                  employed in guarding the roads that lead to them: it is almost impossible for any
                  man to get a sight of them, except those who are employed there; and indeed the
                  strongest curiosity would scarcely induce any man to attempt it, for whoever is
                  found upon the road to them, if he cannot give undeniable evidence of his having
                  business there, is immediately hanged up upon the next tree. </p><p n="86">Much gold is certainly brought from these mines, but at an expence of life,
                  that must strike every man, to whom custom has not made it familiar, with horror.
                  No less than forty thousand negroes are annually imported, on the king's account,
                  to dig the mines; and we were credibly informed, that, the last year but one
                  before we arrived here, this number fell so short, probably from some epidemic
                  disease, that twenty thousand more were draughted from the town of Rio. </p><p n="87">Precious stones are also found here in such plenty, that a certain quantity
                  only is allowed to be collected in a year; to collect this quantity, a number of
                  people are sent into the <pb n="35"/> country where they are found, and when it is
                  got together,* which sometimes happens in a month, sometimes in less and sometimes
                  in more, they return; and after that, whoever is found in these precious
                  districts, on any pretence, before the next year, is immediately put to death. </p><p n="88">The jewels found here, are diamonds, topazes of several kinds, and
                  amethysts. We did not see any of the diamonds, but were informed that the Viceroy
                  had a large quantity by him, which he would sell on the King of Portugal's
                  account, but not at a less price than they are sold for in Europe. Mr. Banks
                  bought a few topazes and amethysts as specimens: of the topazes there are three
                  sorts, of very different value, which are distinguished here by the names of Pinga
                  d'agua qualidade primeiro, Pinga d'agua qualidade secundo, and Chrystallos
                  armerillos: they are sold, large and small, good and bad together, by octavos, or
                  the eighth part of an ounce; the best at <date>4s</date>. <date>9d</date>. All dealing, however, in these
                  stones is prohibited to the subject, under the severest penalties: there were
                  jewellers here formerly, who purchased and worked them on their own account; but
                  about fourteen months before our arrival, orders came from the court of Portugal,
                  that no more stones should be wrought here, except on the King's account: the
                  jewellers were ordered to bring all their tools to the Viceroy, and left without
                  any means of subsistence. The persons employed here to work stones for the King
                  are slaves. </p><p n="89">The coin that is current here, is either that of Portugal, consisting
                  chiefly of thirty-six shillings pieces; or pieces, both of gold and silver, which
                  are struck at this place: the pieces of silver, which are very much debased, are
                  called Petacks, and are of different value, and easily distinguished by the number
                  of rees that is marked on the outside. Here is also <pb n="36"/> a copper coin,*
                  like that in Portugal, of five and ten ree pieces. A ree is a nominal coin of
                  Portugal, ten of which are equal in value to about three farthings sterling. </p><p n="90">The harbour of Rio de Janeiro is situated W. by N. 18 leagues from Cape
                  Trio, and may be known by a remarkable hill, in the form of a sugar-loaf, at the
                  west point of the bay; but as all the coast is very high, and rises in many peaks,
                  the entrance of this harbour may be more certainly distinguished by the islands
                  that lie before it; one of which, called Rodonda, is high and round like a
                  hay-stack, and lies at the distance of two leagues and an half from the entrance
                  of the bay, in the direction of S. by W.; but the first islands which are met
                  with, coming from the east, or Cape Trio, are two that have a rocky appearance,
                  lying near to each other, and at the distance of about four miles from the shore:
                  there are also at the distance of three leagues to the westward of these, two
                  other islands which lie near to each other, a little without the bay on the east
                  side, and very near the shore. This harbour is certainly a good one; the entrance
                  indeed is not wide, but the sea breeze, which blows every day from ten or twelve
                  o'clock till sunset, makes it easy for any ship to go in before the wind; and it
                  grows wider as the town is approached, so that abreast of it there is room for the
                  largest fleet, in five or six fathom water, with an oozy bottom. At the narrow
                  part, the entrance is defended by two forts. The principal is Santa Cruz, which
                  stands on the east point of the bay, and has been mentioned before; that on the
                  west side is called fort Lozia, and is built upon a rock that lies close to the
                  main; the distance between them is about ¾ of a mile, but the channel is not quite
                  so broad, because there are sunken rocks which lie off each fort, and in this part
                  alone there is danger: the narrowness of the channel causes the tides, both flood
                  and ebb, to run with considerable <pb n="37"/> strength,* so that they cannot be
                  stemmed without a fresh breeze. The rockyness of the bottom makes it also unsafe
                  to anchor here; but all danger may be avoided by keeping in the middle of the
                  channel. Within the entrance, the course up the bay is first N. by W. ½ W. and.
                  N.N.W. something more than a league; this will bring the vessel the length of the
                  great road; and N.W. and W.N.W. one league more will carry her to the Isle dos
                  Cobras, which lies before the city: she should then keep the north side of this
                  island close on board, and anchor above it, before a monastery of Benedictines
                  which stands upon a hill at the N.W. end of the city. </p><p n="91">The river, and indeed the whole coast, abounds with a greater variety of
                  fish than we had ever seen; a day seldom passed in which one or more of a new
                  species were not brought to Mr. Banks: the bay also is as well adapted for
                  catching these fish as can be conceived; for it is full of small islands, between
                  which there is shallow water, and proper beaches for drawing the seine. The sea,
                  without the bay, abounds with dolphins, and large mackrel of different kinds,
                  which readily bite at a hook, and the inhabitants always tow one after their boats
                  for that purpose. </p><p n="92">Though the climate is hot, the situation of this place is certainly
                  wholesome; while we stayed here the thermometer never rose higher than 83, though
                  we had frequent rains, and once a very hard gale of wind. </p><p n="93">Ships water here at the fountain in the great square, though, as I have
                  observed, the water is not good; they land their casks upon a smooth sandy beach,
                  which is not more than a hundred yards distant from the fountain, and upon
                  application to the Viceroy, a centinel will be appointed to look after <pb n="38"/> them,* and clear the way to the fountain where they are to be filled. </p><p n="94">Upon the whole, Rio de Janeiro is a very good place for ships to put in at
                  that want refreshment: the harbour is safe and commodious; and provisions, except
                  wheaten bread and flour, may be easily procured: as a succedaneum for bread, there
                  are yams and cassada in plenty; beef, both fresh and jerked, may be bought at
                  about two pence farthing a pound; though, as I have before remarked, it is very
                  lean. The people here jerk their beef by taking out the bones, cutting it into
                  large but thin slices, then curing it with salt, and drying it in the shade: it
                  eats very well, and, if kept dry, will remain good a long time at sea. Mutton is
                  scarcely to be procured, and hogs and poultry are dear; of garden-stuff and fruit
                  there is abundance, of which, however, none can be preserved at sea but the
                  pumpkin; rum, sugar, and molasses, all excellent in their kind, may be had at a
                  reasonable price; tobacco also is cheap, but it is not good. Here is a yard for
                  building shipping, and a small hulk to heave down by; for, as the tide never rises
                  above six or seven foot, there is no other way of coming at a ship's bottom. </p><p n="95">When the boat which had been sent on shore returned, we hoisted her on
                  board, and stood out to sea. </p><p n="96"><!--Page  [unnumbered]--></p><list type="simple"><item>[illustration] A View of Part of the N.E. side of Terra del Fuego taken from

                        Streight of Le Maire, with a Description of some of the Inhabitants of Terra
                        del Fuego.</emph></l></head><p n="97">ON the <date>9th of December</date>,* we observed the sea to be covered with broad
                  streaks of a yellowish colour, several, of them a mile long, and three or four
                  hundred yards wide: some of the water thus coloured was taken up, and found to be
                  full of innumerable atoms pointed at the end, of a yellowish colour, and none more
                  than a quarter of a line, or the fortieth part of an inch long: in the microscope
                  they appeared to be Fasciculi of small fibres interwoven with each other, not
                  unlike the nidus of some of the Phyganeas, called Caddices; but whether they were
                  animal or vegetable substances, whence they came, or for what they were designed,
                  neither Mr. Banks nor Dr. Solander could guess. The same appearance had been
                  observed before, when we first discovered the continent of South America. </p><p n="98">On the <date>11th</date> we hooked a shark,* and while we were playing it under the
                  cabbin window, it threw out, and drew in again several times what appeared to be
                  its stomach: it proved to be a female, and upon being opened six young ones were
                  taken out of it; five of them were alive and swam briskly in a tub of water, but
                  the sixth appeared to have been dead some time. </p><p n="99">Nothing remarkable happened till the <date>30th</date>,* except that we prepared for the
                  bad weather, which we were shortly to expect, by bending a new suit of sails; but
                  on this day we <pb n="40"/> ran a course of one hundred and sixty miles by the
                  log,* through innumerable land insects of various kinds, some upon the wing, and
                  more upon the water, many of which were alive; they appeared to be exactly the
                  same with the Carabi, the Grylli, the Phalanae, Aranea, and other flies that are
                  seen in England, though at this time we could not be less than thirty leagues from
                  land; and some of these insects, particularly the Grylli and Aranea, never
                  voluntarily leave it at a greater distance than twenty yards. We judged ourselves
                  to be now nearly opposite to Baye sans fond, where Mr. Dalrymple supposes there is
                  a passage quite through the continent of America; and we thought from the insects
                  that there might be at least a very large river, and that it had overflowed its
                  banks. </p><p n="100">*On the <date>3d of January</date>, 1769, being in latitude <geo select="lat" n="11">47° 17′ S</geo>. and
                  longitude <geo select="lon" n="11">61° 29′ 45″ W.</geo> we were all looking out for Pepys' island, and
                  for some time an appearance was seen in the east which so much resembled land,
                  that we bore away for it; and it was more than two hours and an half before we
                  were convinced that it was nothing but what sailors call a Fogbank. </p><p n="101">The people now beginning to complain of cold, each of them received what
                  is called a Magellanic jacket, and a pair of trowsers. The jacket is made of a
                  thick woollen-stuff, called Fearnought, which is provided by the government. We
                  saw, from time to time, a great number of penguins, albatrosses, and sheer waters,
                  seals, whales, and porpoises: and on the <date>11th</date>,* having passed Falkland's islands,
                  we discovered the coast of Terra del Fuego, at the distance of about four leagues,
                  extending from the W. to S. E. by S. We had here five and thirty fathom, the
                  ground soft, small slate stones. As we ranged along the shore to the S. E. at the
                  distance of <pb n="41"/> two or three leagues, we perceived smoke in several
                  places,* which was made by the natives, probably as a signal, for they did not
                  continue it after we had passed by. This day we discovered that the ship had got
                  near a degree of longitude to the westward of the log, which, in this latitude, is
                  35 minutes of a degree on the equator: probably there is a small current setting
                  to the westward, which may be caused by the westerly current coming round Cape
                  Horn, and through the Streight of Le Maire, and the indraught of the Streight of
                  Magellan*. </p><p n="102">Having continued to range the coast,* on the <date>14th</date> we entered the Streight
                  of Le Maire; but the tide turning against us, drove us out with great violence,
                  and raised such a sea off Cape St. Diego, that the waves had exactly the same
                  appearance as they would have had if they had broke over a ledge of rocks; and
                  when the ship was in this torrent, she frequently pitched, so that the bowsprit
                  was under water. About noon, we got under the land between Cape St. Diego and Cape
                  St. Vincent, where I intended to have anchored; but finding the ground every where
                  hard and rocky, and shallowing from thirty to twelve fathoms, I sent the Master to
                  examine a little cove which lay at a small distance to the eastward of Cape St.
                  Vincent. When he returned, he reported, that there was anchorage in four fathom,
                  and a good bottom, close to the eastward of the first bluff point, on the east of
                  Cape St. Vincent, at the very entrance of the cove, to which I gave the name of
                  VINCENT's Bay: before this anchoring <pb n="42"/> ground,* however, lay several
                  rocky ledges, that were covered with sea-weed; but I was told that there was not
                  less than eight and nine fathom over all of them. It will probably be thought
                  strange, that where weeds, which grow at the bottom, appear above the surface,
                  there should be this depth of water; but the weeds which grow upon rocky ground in
                  these countries, and which always distinguish it from sand and ooze, are of an
                  enormous size. The leaves are four foot long, and some of the stalks, though not
                  thicker than a man's thumb, above one hundred and twenty: Mr. Banks and Dr.
                  Solander examined some of them, over which we founded and had fourteen fathom,
                  which is eighty-four feet; and, as they made a very acute angle with the bottom,
                  they were thought to be at least one half longer: the foot stalks were swelled
                  into an air vessel, and Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander called this plant Fucus
                  giganteus. Upon the report of the Master, I stood in with the ship; but not
                  trusting implicitly to his intelligence, I continued to sound, and found but four
                  fathom upon the first ledge that I went over; concluding, therefore, that I could
                  not anchor here without risk, I determined to seek some port in the Streight,
                  where I might get on board such wood and water as we wanted. </p><p n="103">Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, however, being very desirous to go on shore, I
                  sent a boat with them and their people, while I kept plying as near as possible
                  with the ship. </p><p n="104">Having been on shore four hours, they returned about nine in the evening,
                  with above an hundred different plants and flowers, all of them wholly unknown to
                  the botanists of Europe. They found the country about the bay to be in general
                  slat, the bottom of it in particular was a plain, covered with grass, which might
                  easily have been made into a large quantity of hay; they found also abundance of
                  good <pb n="43"/> wood and water, and fowl in great plenty.* Among other things,
                  of which Nature has been liberal in this place, is Winter's bark, Winteranea
                  aromatica; which may easily be known by its broad leaf, shaped like the laurel, of
                  a light green colour without, and inclining to blue within: the bark is easily
                  stripped with a bone or a stick, and its virtues are well known: it may be used
                  for culinary purposes as a spice, and is not less pleasant than wholesome: here is
                  also plenty of wild celery and scurvy grass. The trees are chiefly of one kind, a
                  species of the birch, called Betula antartica; the stem is from thirty to forty
                  feet long, and from two to three feet in diameter, so that in a case of necessity
                  they might possibly supply a ship with top-masts: they are a light white wood,
                  bear a small leaf, and cleave very straight. Cranberries were also found here in
                  great plenty, both white and red. </p><p n="105">The persons who landed saw none of the inhabitants, but fell in with two
                  of their deserted huts, one in a thick wood, and the other close by the beach. </p><p n="106">Having taken the boat on board, I made sail into the Streight, and at
                  three in the morning of the <date>15th</date>,* I anchored in twelve fathom and an half, upon
                  coral rocks, before a small cove, which we took for Port Maurice, at the distance
                  of about half a mile from the shore. Two of the natives came down to the beach,
                  expecting us to land; but this spot afforded so little shelter, that I at length
                  determined not to examine it: I therefore got under sail again about ten o'clock,
                  and the savages retired into the woods. </p><p n="107">At two o'clock, we anchored in the bay of Good Success; and after dinner I
                  went on shore, accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, to look for a
                  watering-place, and speak to the Indians, several of whom had come in sight. We
                  landed on the starboard side of the bay near some rocks, which <pb n="44"/> made
                  smooth water and good landing;* thirty or forty of the Indians soon made their
                  appearance at the end of a sandy beach on the other side of the bay, but seeing
                  our number, which was ten or twelve, they retreated. Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander
                  then advanced about one hundred yards before us, upon which two of the Indians
                  returned, and, having advanced some paces towards them, sat down; as soon as they
                  came up, the Indians rose, and each of them having a small stick in his hand threw
                  it away, in a direction both from themselves and the strangers, which was
                  considered as the renunciation of weapons in token of peace: they then walked
                  briskly towards their companions, who had halted at about fifty yards behind them,
                  and beckoned the Gentle men to follow, which they did. They were received with
                  many uncouth signs of friendship; and, in return, they distributed among them some
                  beads and ribbons, which had been brought on shore for that purpose, and with
                  which they were greatly delighted. A mutual confidence and good-will being thus
                  produced, our parties joined; the conversation, such as it was, became general;
                  and three of them accompanied us back to the ship. When they came on board, one of
                  them, whom we took to be a priest, performed much the same ceremonies which M.
                  Bougainville describes, and supposes to be an exorcism. When he was introduced
                  into a new part of the ship, or when any thing that he had not seen before caught
                  his attention, he shouted with all his force for some minutes, without directing
                  his voice either to us or his companions. </p><p n="108">They eat some bread and some beef, but not apparently with much pleasure,
                  though such part of what was given them as they did not eat they took away with
                  them; but they would not swallow a drop either of wine or spirits: they put the
                  glass to their lips, but, having tasted the liquor, <pb n="45"/> they returned it,
                  with strong expressions of disgust.* Curiosity seems to be one of the few passions
                  which distinguish men from brutes; and of this our guests appeared to have very
                  little. They went from one part of the ship to another, and looked at the vast
                  variety of new objects that every moment presented themselves, without any
                  expression either of wonder or pleasure, for the vociferation of our exorcist
                  seemed to be neither. </p><p n="109">After having been on board about two hours, they expressed a desire to go
                  ashore. A boat was immediately ordered, and Mr. Banks thought fit to accompany
                  them: he landed them in safety, and conducted them to their companions, among whom
                  he remarked the same vacant indifference, as in those who had been on board; for
                  as on one side there appeared no eagerness to relate, so on the other there seemed
                  to be no curiosity to hear, how they had been received, or what they had seen. In
                  about half an hour, Mr. Banks returned to the ship, and the Indians retired from
                  the shore. </p></div><pb n="46"/><div type="chapter" n="4"><head><l>CHAP.IV.</l><l><emph rend="italic"> An Account of what happened in ascending a Mountain to
                        search for Plants.</emph></l></head><p n="110">*ON the <date>16th</date>, early in the morning, Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, with their
                  attendants and servants, and two seamen to assist in carrying the baggage,
                  accompanied by Mr. Monkhouse the Surgeon, and Mr. Green the Astronomer, set out
                  from the ship, with a view to penetrate as far as they could into the country, and
                  return at night. The hills, when viewed at a distance, seemed to be partly a wood,
                  partly a plain, and above them a bare rock. Mr. Banks hoped to get through the
                  wood, and made no doubt, but that, beyond it, he should, in a country which no
                  botanist had ever yet visited, find alpine plants which would abundantly
                  compensate his labour. They entered the wood at a small sandy beach, a little to
                  the westward of the watering-place, and continued to ascend the hill, through the
                  pathless wilderness, till three o'clock, before they got a near view of the places
                  which they intended to visit. Soon after they reached what they had taken for a
                  plain; but, to their great disappointment, found it a swamp, covered with low
                  bushes of birch, about three feet high, interwoven with each other, and so
                  stubborn that they could not be bent out of the way; it was therefore necessary to
                  lift the leg over them, which at every step was buried, ancle deep, in the soil.
                  To aggravate the pain and difficulty of such travelling, the weather, which
                  hitherto had been very fine, much like one of our bright days in May, became
                  gloomy and cold; with sudden <pb n="47"/> blasts of a most piercing wind,
                  accompanied with snow.* They pushed forward, however, in good spirits,
                  notwithstanding their fatigue, hoping the worst of the way was past, and that the
                  bare rock which they had seen from the tops of the lower hills was not more than a
                  mile before them; but when they had got about two thirds over this woody swamp,
                  Mr. Buchan, one of Mr. Banks's draughtmen, was unhappily seized with a fit. This
                  made it necessary for the whole company to halt, and as it was impossible that he
                  should go any farther, a fire was kindled, and those who were most fatigued were
                  left behind to take care of him. Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, Mr. Green, and Mr.
                  Monkhouse went on, and in a short time reached the summit. As botanists, their
                  expectations were here abundantly gratified; for they found a great variety of
                  plants, which, with respect to the alpine plants in Europe, are exactly what those
                  plants are with respect to such as grow in the plain. </p><p n="111">The cold was now become more severe, and the snow-blasts more frequent;
                  the day also was so far spent, that it was found impossible to get back to the
                  ship before the next morning: to pass the night upon such a mountain, in such a
                  climate, was not only comfortless, but dreadful; it was impossible however to be
                  avoided, and they were to provide for it as well as they could. </p><p n="112">Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, while they were improving an opportunity which
                  they had, with so much danger and difficulty, procured, by gathering the plants
                  which they found upon the mountain, sent Mr. Green and Mr. Monkhouse back to Mr.
                  Buchan and the people that were with him, with directions to bring them to a hill,
                  which they thought lay in a better rout for returning to the wood, and which was
                  therefore appointed as a general rendezvous. It <pb n="48"/> was proposed,* that
                  from this hill they should push through the swamp, which seemed by the new rout
                  not to be more than half a mile over, into the shelter of the wood, and there
                  build their wigwam, and make a fire: this, as their way was all down hill, it
                  seemed easy to accomplish. Their whole company assembled at the rendezvous, and,
                  though pinched with the cold, were in health and spirks, Mr. Buchan himself having
                  recovered his strength in a much greater degree than could have been expected. It
                  was now near eight o'clock in the evening, but still good day-light, and they set
                  forward for the nearest valley, Mr. Banks himself undertaking to bring up the
                  rear, and see that no straggler was left behind: this may perhaps be thought a
                  superfluous caution, but it will soon appear to be otherwise. Dr. Solander, who
                  had more than once crossed the mountains which divide Sweden from Norway, well
                  knew that extreme cold, especially when joined with fatigue, produces a torpor and
                  sleepiness that are almost irresistible: he therefore conjured the company to keep
                  moving, whatever pain it might cost them, and whatever relief they might be
                  promised by an inclination to rest: Whoever sits down, says he, will sleep; and
                  whoever sleeps, will wake no more. Thus, at once admonished and alarmed, they set
                  forward; but while they were still upon the naked rock, and before they had got
                  among the bushes, the cold became suddenly so intense, as to produce the effects
                  that had been most dreaded. Dr. Solander himself was the first who found the
                  inclination, against which he had warned others, irresistible; and insisted upon
                  being suffered to lie down. Mr. Banks intreated and remonstrated in vain, down he
                  lay upon the ground, though it was covered with snow; and it was with great
                  difficulty that his friend kept him from sleeping. Richmond also, one of the black
                     <pb n="49"/> servants, began to linger,* having suffered from the cold in the
                  same manner as the Doctor. Mr. Banks, therefore, sent five of the company, among
                  whom was Mr. Buchan, forward to get a fire ready at the first convenient place
                  they could find; and himself, with four others, remained with the Doctor and
                  Richmond, whom partly by persuasion and entreaty, and partly by force, they
                  brought on; but when they had got through the greatest part of the birch and
                  swamp, they both declared they could go no farther. Mr. Banks had recourse again
                  to entreaty and expostulation, but they produced no effect: when Richmond was
                  told, that if he did not go on he would in a short time be frozen to death; he
                  answered, That he desired nothing but to lie down and die: the Doctor did not so
                  explicitly renounce his life; he said he was willing to go on, but that he must
                  first take some sleep, though he had before told the company that to sleep was to
                  perish. Mr. Banks and the rest found it impossible to carry them, and there being
                  no remedy they were both suffered to sit down, being partly supported by the
                  bushes, and in a few minutes they fell into a profound sleep: soon after, some of
                  the people who had been sent forward returned, with the welcome news that a fire
                  was kindled about a quarter of a mile farther on the way. Mr. Banks then
                  endeavoured to wake Dr. Solander and happily succeeded: but, though he had not
                  slept five minutes, he had almost lost the use of his limbs, and the muscles were
                  so shrunk that his shoes fell from his feet; he consented to go forward with such
                  assistance as could be given him, but no attempts to relieve poor Richmond were
                  successful. It being found impossible to make him stir, after some time had been
                  lost in the attempt, Mr. Banks left his other black servant and a seaman, who
                  seemed to have suffered least by the cold, to look after him; promising, that as
                  soon as two others should be sufficiently warmed, they should <pb n="50"/> be
                  relieved.* Mr. Banks, with much difficulty, at length got the Doctor to the fire;
                  and soon after sent two of the people who had been refreshed, in hopes that, with
                  the assistance of those who had been left behind, they would be able to bring
                  Richmond, even though it should still be found impossible to wake him. In about
                  half an hour, however, they had the mortification to see these two men return
                  alone; they said, that they had been all round the place to which they had been
                  directed, but could neither find Richmond nor those who had been left with him;
                  and that though they had shouted many times, no voice had replied. This was matter
                  of equal surprise and concern, particularly to Mr. Banks, who, while he was
                  wondering how it could happen, missed a bottle of rum, the company's whole stock,
                  which they now concluded to be in the knapsack of one of the absentees. It was
                  conjectured, that with this Richmond had been rouzed by the two persons who had
                  been left with him, and that, having perhaps drank too freely of it themselves,
                  they had all rambled from the place where they had been left, in search of the
                  fire, instead of waiting for those who should have been their assistants and
                  guides. Another fall of snow now came on, and continued incessantly for two hours,
                  so that all hope of seeing them again, at least alive, were given up; but about
                  twelve o'clock, to the great joy of those at the fire, a shouting was heard at
                  some distance. Mr. Banks, with four more, immediately went out, and found the
                  seaman with just strength enough left to stagger along, and call out for
                  assistance: Mr. Banks sent him immediately to the fire, and, by his direction,
                  proceeded in search of the other two, whom he soon after found. Richmond was upon
                  his legs, but not able to put one before the other; his companion was lying upon
                  the ground, as insensible as a stone. All hands <pb n="51"/> were now called from
                  the fire,* and an attempt was made to carry them to it; but this, notwithstanding
                  the united efforts of the whole company, was found to be impossible. The night was
                  extremely dark, the snow was now very deep, and, under these additional
                  disadvantages, they found it very difficult to make way through the bushes and the
                  bog for themselves, all of them getting many falls in the attempt. The only
                  alternative was to make a fire upon the spot; but the snow which had fallen, and
                  was still falling, besides what was every moment shaken in flakes from the trees,
                  rendered it equally impracticable, to kindle one there, and to bring any part of
                  that which had been kindled in the wood thither: they were, therefore, reduced to
                  the sad necessity of leaving the unhappy wretches to their fate; having first made
                  them a bed of boughs from the trees, and spread a covering of the same kind over
                  them to a considerable height. </p><p n="113">Having now been exposed to the cold and the snow near an hour and an half,
                  some of the rest began to lose their sensibility; and one Briscoe, another of Mr.
                  Banks's servants, was so ill, that it was thought he must die before he could be
                  got to the fire. </p><p n="114">At the fire, however, at length they arrived; and passed the night in a
                  situation, which, however dreadful in itself, was rendered more afflicting by the
                  remembrance of what was past, and the uncertainty of what was to come. Of twelve,
                  the number that set out together in health and spirits, two were supposed to be
                  already dead; a third was so ill, that it was very doubtful whether he would be
                  able to go forward in the morning; and a fourth, Mr. Bunchan, was in danger of a
                  return of his fits, by fresh fatigue after so uncomfortable a night: they were
                  distant from the ship a long day's <pb n="52"/> journey,* through pathless woods,
                  in which it was too probable they might be bewildered till they were overtaken by
                  the next night; and, not having prepared for a journey of more than eight or ten
                  hours, they were wholly destitute of provisions, except a vulture, which they
                  happened to shoot while they were out, and which, if equally divided, would not
                  afford each of them half a meal; and they knew not how much more they might suffer
                  from the cold, as the snow still continued to fall. A dreadful testimony of the
                  severity of the climate, as it was now the midst of summer in this part of the
                  world, the twenty-first of December being here the longest day; and every thing
                  might justly be dreaded from a phaenomenon which, in the corresponding season, is
                  unknown even in Norway and Lapland. </p><p n="115">*When the morning dawned, they saw nothing round them, as far as the eye
                  could reach, but snow, which seemed to lie as thick upon the trees as upon the
                  ground; and the blasts returned so frequently, and with such violence, that they
                  found it impossible for them to set out: how long this might last they knew not,
                  and they had but too much reason to apprehend that it would confine them in that
                  desolate forest till they perished with hunger and cold. </p><p n="116">After having suffered the misery and terror of this situation till six
                  o'clock in the morning, they conceived some hope of deliverance by discovering the
                  place of the sun through the clouds, which were become thinner, and began to break
                  away. Their first care was to see whether the poor wretches whom they had been
                  obliged to leave among the bushes were yet alive; three of the company were
                  dispatched for that purpose, and very soon afterwards returned with the melancholy
                  news, that they were dead. </p><p n="117"><pb n="53"/>Notwithstanding the flattering appearance of the sky,* the snow still
                  continued to fall so thick that they could not venture out upon their journey to
                  the ship; but about 8 o'clock a small regular breeze sprung up, which, with the
                  prevailing influence of the sun, at length cleared the air; and they soon after,
                  with great joy, saw the snow fall in large flakes from the trees, a certain sign
                  of an approaching thaw: they now examined more critically the state of their
                  invalids; Briscoe was still very ill, but said, that he thought himself able to
                  walk; and Mr. Buchan was much better than either he or his friends had any reason
                  to expect. They were now, however, pressed by the calls of hunger, to which, after
                  long fasting, every consideration of future good or evil immediately gives way.
                  Before they set forward, therefore, it was unanimously agreed, that they should
                  eat their vulture; the bird was accordingly skinned, and, it being thought best to
                  divide it before it was fit to be eaten, it was cut into ten portions, and every
                  man cooked his own as he thought fit. After this repast, which furnished each of
                  them with about three mouthfuls, they prepared to set out; but it was ten o'clock
                  before the snow was sufficiently gone off to render a march practicable. After a
                  walk of about three hours, they were very agreeably surprised to find themselves
                  upon the beach, and much nearer to the ship than they had any reason to expect.
                  Upon reviewing their track from the vessel, they perceived, that, instead of
                  ascending the hill in a line, so as to penetrate into the country, they had made
                  almost a circle round it. When they came on board, they congratulated each other
                  upon their safety, with a joy that no man can feel who has not been exposed to
                  equal danger; and as I had suffered great anxiety at their not returning in the
                  evening of the day on which they set out, I was not wholly without my share. </p></div><pb n="54"/><div type="chapter" n="5"><head><l>CHAP.V.</l><l><emph rend="italic"> The Passage through the Streight of Le Maire, and a

                  the boat on shore, and Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander went in it. They landed in the
                  bottom of the bay, and while my people were employed in the cutting brooms, they
                  pursued their great object, the improvement of natural knowlege, with success,
                  collecting many shells and plants which hitherto have been altogether unknown:
                  they came on board to dinner, and afterwards went again on shore to visit an
                  Indian town, which some of the people had reported to lie about two miles up the
                  country. They found the distance not more than by the account, and they approached
                  it by what appeared to be the common road, yet they were above an hour in getting
                  thither, for they were frequently up to their knees in mud; when they got within a
                  small distance, two of the people came out to meet them, with such state as they
                  could assume; when they joined them, they began to hallow as they had done on
                  board the ship, without addressing themselves either to the strangers or their
                  companions; and having continued this strange vociferation some time, they
                  conducted them to the town. It was situated on a dry knoll, or small hill, covered
                  with wood, none of which seemed to have been cleared away, and consisted of about
                  twelve or fourteen hovels, of the most <!--Page  [unnumbered]--></p><p n="119">[illustration] <pb n="55"/> rude and inartificial structure that can be
                  imagined.* They were nothing more than a few poles set up so as to incline towards
                  each other, and meet at the top, forming a kind of a cone, like some of our
                  bee-hives: on the weather side they were covered with a few boughs, and a little
                  grass; and on the lee fide about one eighth of the circle was left open, both for
                  a door and a fire place; and of this kind were the huts that had been seen in St.
                  Vincent's bay, in one of which the embers of a fire were still remaining.
                  Furniture they had none; a little grass, which lay round the inside of the hovel,
                  served both for chairs and beds; and of all the utensils which necessity and
                  ingenuity have concurred to produce among other savage nations, they saw only a
                  basket to carry in the hand, a satchel to hang at the back, and the bladder of
                  some beast to hold water, which the natives drink through a hole that is made near
                  the top for that purpose. The inhabitants of this town were a small tribe, not
                  more than fifty in number, of both sexes and of every age. Their colour resembles
                  that of the rust of iron mixed with oil, and they have long black hair: the men
                  are large, but clumsily built; their stature is from five feet eight to five feet
                  ten; the women are much less, few of them being more than five feet high. Their
                  whole apparel consists of the skin of a guanicoe, or seal, which is thrown over
                  their shoulders, exactly in the state in which it came from the animal's back; a
                  piece of the same skin, which is drawn over their feet, and gathered about the
                  ancles like a purse, and a small flap, which is worn by the women as a succedaneum
                  for a fig-leaf. The men wear their cloak open, the women tie it about their waist
                  with a thong. But although they are content to be naked, they are very ambitious
                  to be fine. Their faces were painted in various forms: the region of the eye <pb n="56"/> was in general white,* and the rest of the face adorned with
                  horizontal streaks of red and black; yet scarcely any two were exactly alike. This
                  decoration seems to be more profuse and elaborate upon particular occasions, for
                  the two Gentlemen who introduced Mr. Banks and the Doctor into the town, were
                  almost covered with streaks of black in all directions, so as to make a very
                  striking appearance. Both men and women wore bracelets of such beads as they could
                  make themselves of small shells or bones; the women both upon their wrists and
                  ancles, the men upon their wrists only; but to compensate for the want of
                  bracelets on their legs, they wore a kind of fillet of brown worsted round their
                  heads. They seemed to set a particular value upon any thing that was red, and
                  preferred beads even to a knife or a hatchet. </p><p n="120">Their language in general is guttural, and they express some of their
                  words by a sound exactly like that which we make to clear the throat when any
                  thing happens to obstruct it; yet they have words which would be deemed soft in
                  the better languages of Europe. Mr. Banks learnt what he supposes to be their name
                  for beads and water. When they wanted beads, instead of ribbons or other trifles,
                  they said hallēcā; and when they were taken on shore from the ship, and by signs
                  asked where water might be found, they made the sign of drinking, and pointing as
                  well to the casks as the watering place, cried Oodâ. </p><p n="121">We saw no appearance of their having any food but shell-fish; for though
                  seals were frequently seen near the shore, they seemed to have no implements for
                  taking them. The shell-fish is collected by the women, whose business it seems to
                  be to attend at low water, with a basket in one hand, a stick, pointed and barbed,
                  in the other, and a satchel at their backs: they loosen the limpets, and other
                  fish that adhere to <pb n="57"/> the rocks, with the stick, and put them into the
                  basket;* which, when full, they empty into the satchel. </p><p n="122">The only things that we found among them in which there was the least
                  appearance of neatness or ingenuity, were their weapons, which consisted of a bow
                  and arrows. The bow was not inelegantly made, and the arrows were the neatest that
                  we had ever seen: they were of wood, polished to the highest degree; and the
                  point, which was of glass or flint, and barbed, was formed and fitted with
                  wonderful dexterity. We saw also some pieces of glass and flint among them
                  unwrought, besides rings, buttons, cloth, and canvass, with other European
                  commodities; they must therefore sometimes travel to the northward, for it is many
                  years since any ship has been so far south as this part of Terra del Fuego. We
                  observed also, that they shewed no surprise at our firearms, with the use of which
                  they appeared to be well acquainted; for they made signs to Mr. Banks to shoot a
                  seal which followed the boat as they were going on shore from the ship. </p><p n="123">M. de Bougainville, who, in January 1768, just one year before us, had
                  been on shore upon this coast in latitude <geo select="lat">53° 40′ 41″</geo>, had, among other
                  things, given glass to the people whom he found here; for he says, that a boy
                  about twelve years old took it into his head to eat some of it: by this unhappy
                  accident he died in great misery; but the endeavours of the good father, the
                  French Aumonier, were more successful than those of the Surgeon; for though the
                  Surgeon could not save his life, the charitable Priest found means to steal a
                  Christian baptism upon him so secretly, that none of his Pagan relations knew any
                  thing of the matter. These people might probably have some of the very glass which
                  Bougainville left behind him, either from other natives, or perhaps <pb n="58"/>
                  from himself;* for they appeared rather to be a travelling hord, than to have any
                  fixed habitation. Their houses are built to stand but for a short time; they have
                  no utensil or furniture but the basket and satchel, which have been mentioned
                  before, and which have handles adapted to the carrying them about, in the hand and
                  upon the back; the only cloathing they had here was scarcely sufficient to prevent
                  their perishing with cold in the summer of this country, much less in the extreme
                  severity of winter; the shell-fish which seems to be their only food must soon be
                  exhausted at any one place; and we had seen houses upon what appeared to be a
                  deserted station in St. Vincent's bay. </p><p n="124">It is also probable that the place where we found them was only a
                  temporary residence, from their having here nothing like a boat or canoe, of which
                  it can scarcely be supposed that they were wholly destitute, especially as they
                  were not sea-sick, or particularly affected, either in our boat or on board the
                  ship. We conjectured that there might be a streight or inlet, running from the sea
                  through great part of this island, from the Streight of Magellan, whence these
                  people might come, leaving their canoes where such inlet terminated. </p><p n="125">They did not appear to have among them any government or subordination:
                  none was more respected than another; yet they seemed to live together in the
                  utmost harmony and good fellowship. Neither did we discover any appearance of
                  religion among them, except the noises which have been mentioned, and which we
                  supposed to be a superstitious ceremony, merely because we could refer them to
                  nothing else: they were used only by one of those who came on board the ship, and
                  the two who conducted Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander to the town, whom we therefore
                  conjectured to be <pb n="59"/> priests. Upon the whole,* these people appeared to
                  be the most destitute and forlorn, as well as the most stupid of all human beings;
                  the outcasts of Nature, who spent their lives in wandering about the dreary
                  wastes, where two of our people perished with cold in the midst of summer; with no
                  dwelling but a wretched hovel of sticks and grass, which would not only admit the
                  wind, but the snow and the rain; almost naked; and destitute of every convenience
                  that is furnished by the rudest art, having no implement even to dress their food:
                  yet they were content. They seemed to have no wish for any thing more than they
                  possessed, nor did anything that we offered them appear acceptable but beads, as
                  an ornamental superfluity of life. What bodily pain they might suffer from the
                  severities of their winter we could not know; but it is certain, that they
                  suffered nothing from the want of the innumerable articles which we consider, not
                  as the luxuries and conveniencies only, but the necessaries of life: as their
                  desires are few, they probably enjoy them all; and how much they may be gainers by
                  an exemption from the care, labour and solicitude, which arise from a perpetual
                  and unsuccessful effort to gratify that infinite variety of desires which the
                  refinements of artificial life have produced among us, is not very easy to
                  determine: possibly this may counterbalance all the real disadvantages of their
                  situation in comparison with ours, and make the scales by which good and evil are
                  distributed to man, hang even between us. </p><p n="126">In this place we saw no quadruped except seals, sea-lions, and dogs; of
                  the dogs it is remarkable that they bark, which those that are originally bred in
                  America do not. And this is a further proof, that the people we saw here had,
                  either immediately or remotely, communicated with the inhabitants of Europe. There
                  are, however, other quadrupeds in this part of the country; for when Mr. Banks was
                  at the top <pb n="60"/> of the highest hill that he ascended in his expedition
                  through the woods,* he saw the footsteps of a large beast imprinted upon the
                  surface of a bog, though he could not with any probability guess of what kind it
                  might be. </p><p n="127">Of land-birds there are but few; Mr. Banks saw none larger than an English
                  blackbird, except some hawks and a vulture; but of water-fowl there is great
                  plenty, particularly ducks. Of fish we saw scarce any, and with our hooks could
                  catch none that was fit to eat; but shell-fish, limpets, clams, and muscles were
                  to be found in abundance. </p><p n="128">Among the insects, which were not numerous, there was neither gnat nor
                  musquito, nor any other species that was either hurtful or troublesome, which
                  perhaps is more than can be said of any other uncleared country. During the
                  snow-blasts, which happened every day while we were here, they hide themselves;
                  and the moment it is fair they appear again, as nimble and vigorous as the warmest
                  weather could make them. </p><p n="129">Of plants, Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander found a vast variety; the far
                  greater part wholly different from any that have been hitherto described. Besides
                  the birch, and winter's bark, which have been mentioned already, there is the
                  beach, Fagus antarcticus, which, as well as the birch, may be used for timber. The
                  plants cannot be enumerated here; but as the scurvy-grass, Cardamine
                  antiscorbutica, and the wild celery, Apium antarcticum, probably contain
                  antiscorbutic qualities, which may be of great benefit to the crews of such ships
                  as shall hereafter touch at this place, the following short description is
                  inserted: </p><p n="130">The scurvy-grass will be found in plenty in damp places, near springs of
                  water, and in general in all places that lie near the beach, especially at the
                  watering-place in the Bay <pb n="61"/> of Good Success: when it is young,* the
                  state of its greatest perfection, it lies flat upon the ground, having many leaves
                  of a bright green, standing in pairs opposite to each other, with a single one at
                  the end, which generally makes the fifth upon a foot stalk: the plant, passing
                  from this state, shoots up in stalks that are sometimes two feet high, at the top
                  of which are small white blossoms, and these are succeeded by long pods: the whole
                  plant greatly resembles that which in England is called Lady's smock, or
                  Cuckow-flower. The wild celery is very like the celery in our gardens, the flowers
                  are white, and stand in the same manner, in small tufts at the top of the
                  branches, but the leaves are of a deeper green. It grows in great abundance near
                  the beach, and generally upon the soil that lies next above the spring tides. It
                  may indeed easily be known by the taste, which is between that of celery and
                  parsley. We used the celery in large quantities, particularly in our soup, which,
                  thus medicated, produced the same good effects which seamen generally derive from
                  a vegetable diet, after having been long confined to salt provisions. </p><p n="131">On Sunday, the <date>22d of January</date>,* about two o'clock in the morning, having
                  got our wood and water on board, we sailed out of the Bay, and continued our
                  course through the Streight. </p></div><pb n="62"/><div type="chapter" n="6"><head><l>CHAP.VI.</l><l><emph rend="italic"> A general Description of the S. E. part of Terra del

                        America, into the South Seas.</emph></l></head><p n="132">*ALMOST an writers who have mentioned the island of Terra del Fuego,
                  describe it as destitute of wood, and covered with snow. In the winter it may
                  possibly be covered with snow, and those who saw it at that season might perhaps
                  be easily deceived, by its appearance, into an opinion that it was destitute of
                  wood. Lord Anson was there in the beginning of March, which answers to our
                  September; and we were there the beginning of January, which answers to our July,
                  which may account for the difference of his description of it from ours. We fell
                  in with it about twenty-one leagues to the westward of the Streight of Le Maire,
                  and from the time that we first saw it, trees were plainly to be distinguished
                  with our glasses; and as we came nearer, though here and there we discovered
                  patches of snow, the sides of the hills and the sea-coast appeared to be covered
                  with a beautiful verdure. The hills are lofty, but not mountainous, though the
                  summits of them are quite naked. The soil in the valleys is rich, and of a
                  considerable depth; and at the foot of almost every hill there is a brook, the
                  water of which has a reddish hue, like that which runs through our turf bogs in
                  England, but it is by no means ill tasted, and upon <pb n="63"/> the whole proved
                  to be the best that we took in during our voyage. We ranged the coast to the
                  Streight,* and had foundings all the way from 40 to 20 fathom, upon a gravelly and
                  sandy bottom. The most remarkable land on Terra del Fuego is a hill, in the form
                  of a sugar-loaf, which stands on the west side not far from the sea; and the three
                  hills, called the three brothers, about nine miles to the westward of Cape St.
                  Diego, the low point that forms the north entrance of the Streight of Le Maire. </p><p n="133">It is said in the account of Lord Anson's voyage, that it is difficult to
                  determine exactly where the Streight lies, though the appearance of Terra del
                  Fuego be well known, without knowing also the appearance of Staten Land; and that
                  some navigators have been deceived by three hills on Staten Land, which have been
                  mistaken for the three brothers on Terra del Fuego, and so over-shot the Streight.
                  But no ship can possibly miss the Streight that coasts Terra del Fuego within
                  sight of land, for it will then, of itself, be sufficiently conspicuous; and
                  Staten Land, which forms the east side, will be still more manifestly
                  distinguished, for there is no land on Terra del Fuego like it. The Streight of Le
                  Maire can be missed only by standing too far to the eastward, without keeping the
                  land of Terra del Fuego in sight: if this is done, it may be missed, however
                  accurately the appearance of the coast of Staten Land may have been exhibited; and
                  if this is not done, it cannot be missed, though the appearance of that coast be
                  not known. The entrance of the Streight should not be attempted but with a fair
                  wind and moderate weather, and upon the very beginning of the tide of flood, which
                  happens here, at the full and change of the moon, about one or two o'clock; it is
                  also best to keep as near to the Terra del Fuego shore as the winds will admit. By
                  attending to these particulars, a ship may be got quite through the <pb n="64"/>
                  Streight in one tide;* or, at least, to the southward of Success Bay, into which
                  it will be more prudent to put, if the wind should be southerly, than to attempt
                  the weathering of Staten Land with a lee wind and a current, which may endanger
                  her being driven on that island. </p><p n="134">The Streight itself, which is bounded on the west by Terra del Fuego, and
                  on the east by the west end of Staten Land, is about five leagues long, and as
                  many broad. The Bay of Good Success lies about the middle of it, on the Terra del
                  Fuego side, and is discovered immediately upon entering the Streight from the
                  northward; and the south head of it may be distinguished by a mark on the land,
                  that has the appearance of a broad road, leading up from the sea into the country:
                  at the entrance it is half a league wide, and runs in westward about two miles and
                  an half. There is good anchorage in every part of it, in from ten to seven fathom,
                  clear ground; and it affords plenty of exceeding good wood and water. The tides
                  flow in the Bay, at the full and change of the moon, about four or five o'clock,
                  and rise about five or six feet perpendicular. But the flood runs two or three
                  hours longer in the Streight than in the Bay; and the ebb, or northerly current,
                  runs with near double the strength of the flood. </p><p n="135">In the appearance of Staten Land, we did not discover the wildness and
                  horror that is ascribed to it in the account of Lord Anson's voyage. On the north
                  side are the appearances of bays or harbours; and the land, when we saw it, was
                  neither destitute of wood nor verdure, nor covered with snow. The island seems to
                  be about twelve leagues in length, and five broad. </p><p n="136">On the west side of the Cape of Good Success, which forms the S. W.
                  entrance of the Streight, lies Valentine's Bay, of <pb n="65"/> which we only saw
                  the entrance;* from this bay the land trends away to the W. S. W. for twenty or
                  thirty leagues; it appears to be high and mountainous, and forms several bays and
                  inlets. </p><p n="137">At the distance of fourteen leagues from the bay of Good Success, in the
                  direction of S. W. ½ W. and between two and three leagues from the shore, lies New
                  Island. It is about two leagues in length from N. E. to S. W. and terminates to
                  the N. E. in a remarkable hillock. At the distance of seven leagues from New
                  Island, in the direction of S. W. lies the isle Evouts; and a little to the west
                  of the south of this island lie Barnevelt's two small flat islands, close to each
                  other; they are partly surrounded with rocks, which rise to different heights
                  above the water, and lie twenty-four leagues from the Streight of Le Maire. At the
                  distance of three leagues from Barnevelt's islands, in the direction of S. W. by
                  S. lies the S. E. point of Hermit's islands: these islands lie S. E. and N. W. and
                  are pretty high: from most points of view they will be taken for one island, or a
                  part of the main. </p><p n="138">From the S. E. point of Hermit's islands to Cape Horn the course is S.W.
                  by S. distance three leagues. </p><p n="139">The appearance of this Cape and Hermit's islands is represented in the
                  chart of this coast, from our first making land to the Cape, which includes the
                  Streight of Le Maire, and part of Staten Land. In this chart I have laid down no
                  land, nor traced out any shore but what I saw myself, and thus far it may be
                  depended upon: the bays and inlets, of which we saw only the openings, are not
                  traced; it can, however, scarcely be doubted, but that most, if not all of them,
                  afford anchorage, wood and water. The Dutch squadron, commanded by Hermit,
                  certainly put into some of them in the year 1624; and was Chapenham, the Vice <pb n="66"/> Admiral of this squadron,* who first discovered that the land of Cape
                  Horn consisted of a number of islands. The account, however, which those who
                  sailed in Hermit's fleet have given of these parts is extremely defective; and
                  those of Schouton and Le Maire are still worse: it is therefore no wonder that the
                  charts hitherto published should be erroneous, not only in laying down the land,
                  but in the latitude and longitude of the places they contain. I will, however,
                  venture to assert, that the longitude of few parts of the world is better
                  ascertained than that of the Streight of Le Maire, and Cape Horn, in the chart now
                  offered to the public, as it was laid down by several observations of the sun and
                  moon, that were made both by myself and Mr. Green. </p><p n="140">The variation of the compass on this coast I found to be from
                     <geo select="lon">23°</geo> to <geo select="lon">25° E</geo>. except near Barnevelt's islands and Cape
                  Horn, where we found it less, and unsettled; probably it is disturbed here by the
                  land, as Hermit's squadron, in this very place found all their compasses differ
                  from each other. The declination of the dipping-needle, when set up on shore in
                  Success Bay, was <geo select="lat">68° 15′</geo> below the horizon. </p><p n="141">Between Streight Le Maire and Cape Horn, we found a current setting,
                  generally very strong, to the N. E. when we were in with the shore; but lost it
                  when we were at the distance of fifteen or twenty leagues. </p><p n="142">*On the <date>26th of January</date>, we took our departure from Cape Horn, which lies
                  in latitude <geo select="lat" n="12">55° 53′ S</geo>. longitude <geo select="lon" n="12">68° 13′ W</geo>. The farthest
                  southern latitude that we made was <geo select="lat" n="13">60° 10′</geo>, our longitude was then
                  <geo select="lon" n="13">74° 30′ W</geo>.; and we found the variation of the compass, by the mean
                  of eighteen azimuths, to be <geo select="lon">27° 9′ E</geo>. As the weather was frequently
                  calm, Mr. Banks went out in a small boat to shoot birds, among which were some
                  albatrosses and sheerwaters. The albatrosses were observed <pb n="67"/> to be
                  larger than those which had been taken northward of the Streight;* one of them
                  measured ten feet two inches from the tip of one wing to that of the other, when
                  they were extended: the sheerwater, on the contrary, is less, and darker coloured
                  on the back. The albatrosses we skinned, and having soaked them in salt water till
                  the morning, we parboiled them, then throwing away the liquor, stewed them in a
                  very little fresh water till they were tender, and had them served up with savoury
                  sauce; thus dressed, the dish was universally commended, and we eat of it very
                  heartily even when there was fresh pork upon the table. </p><p n="143">From a variety of observations which were made with great care, it
                  appeared probable in the highest degree, that, from the time of our leaving the
                  land to the <date>13th of February</date>, when we were in latitude <geo select="lat" n="14">49° 32′</geo>, and
                  longitude <geo select="lon" n="14">90° 37′</geo>,* we had no current to the west. </p><p n="144">At this time we had advanced about <geo select="lon">12°</geo> to the westward, and <geo select="lat">3
                  and ½ to the n</geo>orthward of the Streight of Magellan: having been just three and
                  thirty days in coming round the land of Terra del Fuego, or Cape Horn, from the
                  east entrance of the Streight to this situation. And though the doubling of Cape
                  Horn is so much dreaded, that, in the general opinion, it is more eligible to pass
                  through the Streight of Magellan, we were not once brought under our close reef'd
                  topsails after we left the Streight of Le Maire. The Dolphin in her last voyage,
                  which she performed at the same season of the year with ours, was three months in
                  getting through the Streight of Magellan, exclusive of the time that she lay in
                  Port Famine; and I am persuaded, from the winds we had, that if we had come by
                  that passage, we should not at this time have been in these seas; that our people
                  would have been fatigued, and our anchors, cables, sails and rigging <pb n="68"/>
                  much damaged;* neither of which inconveniencies we had now suffered. But supposing
                  it more eligible to go round the Cape, than through the Streight of Magellan; it
                  may still be questioned, whether it is better to go through the Streight of Le
                  Maire, or stand to the eastward, and go round Staten Land. The advice given in the
                  Account of Lord Anson's voyage is, </p><p n="145">That all ships bound to the South Seas, instead of passing through the
                  Streight of Le Maire, should constantly pass to the eastward of Staten Land, and
                  should be invariably bent on running to the southward as far as the latitude of 61
                  or 62 degrees, before they endeavour to stand to the westward. But, in my opinion,
                  different circumstances may at one time render it eligible to pass through the
                  Streight, and to keep to the eastward of Staten Land at another. If the land is
                  fallen in with to the westward of the Streight, and the wind is favourable for
                  going through, I think it would be very injudicious to lose time by going round
                  Staten Land, as I am confident that, by attending to the directions which I have
                  given, the Streight may be passed with the utmost safety and convenience: but if,
                  on the contrary, the land is fallen in with to the eastward of the Streight, and
                  the wind should prove tempestuous or unfavourable, I think it would be best to go
                  round Staten Land. But I cannot in any case concur in recommending the running
                  into the latitude of 61 or 62, before any endeavour is made to stand to the
                  westward. We found neither the current nor the storms which the running so far to
                  the southward is supposed necessary to avoid; and indeed, as the winds almost
                  constantly blow from that quarter, it is scarcely possible to pursue the advice.
                  The navigator has no choice but to stand to the southward, close upon a wind, and
                  by keeping upon that tack, he will not only make southing, but westing; and, if
                  the wind varies towards the north of <pb n="69"/> the west, his westing will be
                  considerable. It will, indeed,* be highly proper to make sure of a westing
                  sufficient to double all the lands, before an attempt is made to stand to the
                  northward, and to this every man's own prudence will of necessity direct him. We
                  now began to have strong gales and heavy seas, with irregular intervals of calm
                  and fine weather. </p></div><div type="chapter" n="7"><head><l>CHAP.VII.</l><l><emph rend="italic"> The Sequel of the Passage from Cape Horn to the newly

                        happened during the Course, and at the Ship's Arrival among them.</emph></l></head><p n="146">ON the <date>1st of March</date>,* we were in latitude <geo select="lat" n="15">38° 44′ S</geo>. and

                  agreement, after a run of 660 leagues, was thought to be very extraordinary; and
                  is a demonstration, that after we left the land of Cape Horn we had no current
                  that affected the ship. It renders it also highly probable, that we had been near
                  no land of any considerable extent; for currents are always found when land is not
                  remote, and sometimes, particularly on the east side of the continent in the North
                  Sea, when land has been distant 100 leagues. </p><p n="147">Many birds, as usual, were constantly about the ship, so that Mr. Banks
                  killed no less than 62 in one day; and what is more remarkable, he caught two
                  forest flies, both of them of the same species, but different from any that have
                  hitherto <pb n="70"/> been described;* these probably belonged to the birds, and
                  came with them from the land, which we judged to be at a great distance. Mr. Banks
                  also, about this time, found a large cuttle-fish, which had just been killed by
                  the birds, floating in a mangled condition upon the water; it was very different
                  from the cuttle-fishes that are found in the European seas; for its arms, instead
                  of suckers, were furnished with a double row of very sharp talons, which resembled
                  those of a cat, and, like them, were retractable into a sheath of skin, from which
                  they might be thrust at pleasure. Of this cuttle-fish we made one of the best
                  soups we had ever tasted. </p><p n="148">*The albatrosses now began to leave us, and after the <date>8th</date> there was not
                  one to be seen. We continued our course without any memorable event till the
                  <date>24th</date>,* when some of the people who were upon the watch in the night, reported that
                  they saw a log of wood pass by the ship; and that the sea, which was rather rough,
                  became suddenly as smooth as a mill-pond. It was a general opinion, that there was
                  land to windward; but I did not think myself at liberty to search for what I was
                  not sure to find; though I judged we were not far from the islands that were
                  discovered by Quiros in 1606. Our latitude was <geo select="lat" n="16">22° 11′S</geo>. and longitude
                  <geo select="lon" n="16">127° 55′W</geo>. </p><p n="149">*On the <date>25th</date>, about noon, one of the marines, a young fellow about twenty,
                  was placed as centry at the cabbin door; while he was upon this duty, one of my
                  servants was at the same place preparing to cut a piece of seal-skin into
                  tobacco-pouches: he had promised one to several of the men, but had refused one to
                  this young fellow, though he had asked him several times; upon which he jocularly
                  threatened to steal one, if it should be in his power. It happened that the
                  servant being called hastily away, gave the skin in charge to <pb n="71"/> the
                  centinel,* without regarding what had passed between them. The centinel
                  immediately secured a piece of the skin, which the other missing at his return,
                  grew angry; but after some altercation, contented himself with taking it away,
                  declaring, that, for so trifling an affair, he would not complain of him to the
                  officers. But it happened that one of his fellow soldiers, over-hearing the
                  dispute, came to the knowlege of what had happened, and told it to the rest; who,
                  taking it into their heads to stand up for the honour of their corps, reproached
                  the offender with great bitterness, and reviled him in the most opprobrious terms;
                  they exaggerated his offence into a crime of the deepest die; they said it was a
                  theft by a centry when he was upon duty, and of a thing that had been committed to
                  his trust; they declared it a disgrace to associate with him; and the Serjeant, in
                  particular, said that, if the person from whom the skin had been stolen would not
                  complain, he would complain himself; for that his honour would suffer if the
                  offender was not punished. From the scoffs and reproaches of these men of honour,
                  the poor young fellow retired to his hammock in an agony of confusion and shame.
                  The Serjeant soon after went to him, and ordered him to follow him to the deck: he
                  obeyed without reply; but it being in the dusk of the evening, he slipped from the
                  Serjeant and went forward: he was seen by some of the people, who thought he was
                  gone to the head; but a search being made for him afterwards, it was found that he
                  had thrown himself overboard; and I was then first made acquainted with the theft
                  and its circumstances. </p><p n="150">The loss of this man was the more regretted as he was remarkably quiet and
                  industrious, and as the very action that put an end to his life was a proof of an
                  ingenuous mind; for to such only disgrace is insupportable. </p><pb n="70"/>

               <!--$B!R(B1 page duplicate$B!S(--><p n="151"><pb n="72"/>*On Tuesday the <date>4th of April</date>, about ten o'clock in the morning, Mr.
                  Banks's servant, Peter Briscoe, discovered land, bearing south, at the distance of
                  about three or four leagues. I immediately hauled up for it, and found it to be an
                  island of an oval form, with a lagoon in the middle, which occupied much the
                  larger part of it; the border of land which circumscribes the lagoon is in many
                  places very low and narrow, particularly on the south side, where it consists
                  principally of a beach or reef of rocks: it has the same appearance also in three
                  places on the north side; so that, the firm land being disjoined, the whole looks
                  like many islands covered with wood. On the west end of the island is a large tree
                  or clump of trees, that in appearance resembles a tower; and about the middle are
                  two cocoa-nut trees, which rise above all the rest, and, as we came near to the
                  island, appeared like a flag. We approached it on the north side, and though we
                  came within a mile, we found no bottom with 130 fathom of line, nor did there
                  appear to be any anchorage about it. The whole is covered with trees of different
                  verdure, but we could distinguish none, even with our glasses, except cocoa-nuts
                  and palm-nuts. We saw several of the natives upon the shore, and counted four and
                  twenty. They appeared to be tall, and to have heads remarkably large; perhaps they
                  had something wound round them which we could not distinguish; they were of a
                  copper colour, and had long black hair. Eleven of them walked along the beach
                  abreast of the ship, with poles or pikes in their hands which reached twice as
                  high as themselves: while they walked on the beach they seemed to be naked; but
                  soon after they retired, which they did as soon as the ship had passed the island,
                  they covered themselves with something that made them appear of a light colour.
                  Their habitations were under some clumps of palm-nut trees, <pb n="73"/> which at
                  a distance appeared like high ground; and to us,* who for a long time had seen
                  nothing but water and sky, except the dreary hills of Terra del Fuego, these
                  groves seemed a terrestrial paradise. To this spot, which lies in latitude
                  <geo select="lat" n="17">18° 47′ S</geo>. and longitude <geo select="lon" n="17">139° 28′ W</geo>. we gave the name of
                  LAGOON ISLAND. The variation of the needle here is <geo select="lon">2° 54′ E</geo>. </p><p n="152">About one o'clock we made sail to the westward,* and about half an hour
                  after three we saw land again to the N. W. We got up with it at sunset, and it
                  proved to be a low woody island, of a circular form, and not much above a mile in
                  compass. We discovered no inhabitants, nor could we distinguish any cocoa-nut
                  trees, though we were within half a mile of the shore. The land, however, was
                  covered with verdure of many hues. It lies in latitude <geo select="lat" n="18">18° 35′ S</geo>. and
                  longitude <geo select="lon" n="18">139° 48′ W</geo>. and is distant from Lagoon Island, in the
                  direction of N. 62 W. about seven leagues. We called it THRUMB-CAP. I discovered,
                  by the appearance of the shore, that at this place it was low-water; and I had
                  observed at Lagoon Island, that it was either high-water, or that the sea neither
                  ebbed nor flowed: I infer, therefore, that a S. by E. or S. moon makes high-water. </p><p n="153">We went on with a fine trade-wind and pleasant weather,* and on the <date>5th</date>,
                  about three in the afternoon, we discovered land to the westward. It proved to be
                  a low island, of much greater extent than either of those that we had seen before,
                  being about ten or twelve leagues in compass. Several of us remained at the
                  mast-head the whole evening, admiring its extraordinary figure: it was shaped
                  exactly like a bow, the arch and cord of which were land, and the space between
                  them water; the cord was a flat beach, without any signs of vegetation, having
                  nothing upon it but heaps of sea weed, <pb n="74"/> which lay in different
                  ridges,* as higher or lower tides had left them. It appeared to be about three or
                  four leagues long, and not more than two hundred yards wide; but as a horizontal
                  plain is always seen in perspective, and greatly fore-shortened, it is certainly
                  much wider than it appeared: the horns, or extremities of the bow, were two large
                  tufts of cocoa-nut trees; and much the greater part of the arch was covered with
                  trees of different height, figure and hue; in some parts, however, it was naked
                  and low like the cord: some of us thought they discovered openings through the
                  cord, into the pool, or lake, that was included between that and the bow; but
                  whether there were or were not such openings is uncertain. We sailed abreast of
                  the low beach, or bow-string, within less than a league of the shore, till sunset,
                  and we then judged ourselves to be about half way between the two horns: here we
                  brought to, and sounded, but found no bottom with one hundred and thirty fathom;
                  and, as it is dark almost instantly after sunset in these latitudes, we suddenly
                  lost sight of the land, and making sail again, before the line was well hauled in,
                  we steered by the sound of the breakers, which were distinctly heard till we got
                  clear of the coast. </p><p n="154">We knew this island to be inhabited, by smoke which we saw in different
                  parts of it, and we gave it the name of Bow ISLAND. Mr. Gore, my Second
                  Lieutenant, said, after we had sailed by the island, that he had seen several of
                  the natives, under the first clump of trees, from the deck; that he had
                  distinguished their houses, and seen several canoes hauled up under the shade; but
                  in this he was more fortunate than any other person on board. The east end of this
                  island, which from its figure we called the Bow, lies in latitude <geo select="lat" n="19">18° 23′
                     S</geo>. and longitude <geo select="lon" n="19">141° 12′ W</geo>. we observed the variation of the
                  compass to be <geo select="lon">5° 38′ E</geo>. </p><p n="155"><pb n="75"/>On the next day, Thursday the <date>6th</date>, about noon,* we saw land again to
                  the westward, and came up with it about three. It appeared to be two islands, or
                  rather groups of islands, extending from N.W. by N. to S.E. by S. about nine
                  leagues. Of these, the two largest were separated from each other by a channel of
                  about half a mile broad, and were severally surrounded by smaller islands, to
                  which they were joined by reefs that lay under water. </p><p n="156">These islands were long narrow strips of land, ranging in all directions,
                  some of them ten miles or upwards in length, but none more than a quarter of a
                  mile broad, and upon all of them there were trees of various kinds, particularly
                  the cocoa-nut. The south-eastermost of them lies in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="20">18° 12′
                     S</geo>. and longitude <geo select="lon" n="20">142° 42′ W</geo>. and at the distance of
                  twenty-five leagues, in the direction of W. ½ N. from the west end of Bow Island.
                  We ranged along the S. W. side of this island, and hauled into a bay which lies to
                  the N. W. of the southermost point of the Group, where there was a smooth sea, and
                  the appearance of anchorage, without much surf on the shore. We sounded, but we
                  found no bottom with one hundred fathom, at the distance of no more than three
                  quarters of a mile from the beach, and I did not think it prudent to go nearer. </p><p n="157">While this was doing, several of the inhabitants assembled upon the shore,
                  and some came out in their canoes as far as the reefs, but would not pass them:
                  when we saw this, we ranged, with an easy sail, along the shore; but just as we
                  were passing the end of the island, six men, who had for some time kept abreast of
                  the ship, suddenly launched two canoes with great quickness and dexterity, and
                  three of them getting into each, they put off, as we imagined with a design to
                  come on board us; the ship was therefore brought <pb n="76"/> to,* but they, like
                  their fellows, stopped at the reef; we did not however immediately make sail, as
                  we observed two messengers dispatched to them from the other canoes, which were of
                  a much larger size: we perceived that these messengers made great expedition,
                  wading and swimming along the reef; at length they met, and the men on board the
                  canoes making no dispositions to pass the reef, after having received the message,
                  we judged that they had resolved to come no farther: after waiting, therefore,
                  some little time longer, we stood off; but when we were got about two or three
                  miles from the shore, we perceived some of the natives following us in a canoe
                  with a sail; we did not, however, think it worth while to wait for her, and though
                  she had passed the reef, she soon after gave over the chace. </p><p n="158">According to the best judgment that we could form of the people when we
                  were nearest the shore, they were about our size, and well-made. They were of a
                  brown complexion, and appeared to be naked; their hair, which was black, was
                  confined by a fillet that went round the head, and stuck out behind like a bush.
                  The greater part of them carried in their hands two weapons; one of them was a
                  slender pole, from ten to fourteen feet long, on one end of which was a small
                  knob, not unlike the point of a spear; the other was about four feet long, and
                  shaped like a paddle, and possibly might be so, for some of their canoes were very
                  small: those which we saw them launch seemed not intended to carry more than the
                  three men that got into them: we saw others that had on board six or seven men,
                  and one of them hoisted a sail which did not seem to reach more than six feet
                  above the gunwale of the boat, and which, upon the falling of a slight shower, was
                  taken down and converted into an awning or tilt. The canoe which followed us to
                  sea hoisted a sail not <pb n="77"/> unlike an English lug-sail,* and almost as
                  lofty as an English boat of the same size would have carried. </p><p n="159">The people, who kept abreast of the ship on the beach, made many signals;
                  but whether they were intended to frighten us away, or invite us on shore, it is
                  not easy to determine: we returned them by waving our hats and shouting, and they
                  replied by shouting again. We did not put their disposition to the test, by
                  attempting to land; because, as the island was inconsiderable, and as we wanted
                  nothing that it could afford, we thought it imprudent as well as cruel to risk a
                  contest, in which the natives must have suffered by our superiority, merely to
                  gratify an idle curiosity; especially as we expected soon to fall in with the
                  island where we had been directed to make our astronomical observation, the
                  inhabitants of which would probably admit us without opposition, as they were
                  already acquainted with our strength, and might also procure us a ready and
                  peaceable reception among the neighbouring people, if we should define it. </p><p n="160">To these islands we gave the name of THE GROUPS. </p><p n="161">On the <date>7th</date>, about half an hour after six in the morning,* being just at
                  day-break, we discovered another island to the northward, which we judged to be
                  about four miles in circumference. The land lay very low, and there was a piece of
                  water in the middle of it; there seemed to be some wood upon it, and it looked
                  green and pleasant; but we saw neither cocoa trees nor inhabitants: it abounded
                  however with birds, and we therefore gave it the name of BIRD-ISLAND. </p><p n="162">It lies in latitude <geo select="lat" n="21">17° 48′ S</geo>. and longitude <geo select="lon" n="21">143° 35′
                     W</geo>. at the distance of ten leagues, in the direction W. ½ N. from the west
                  end of the Groups. The variation here was <geo select="lon">6° 32′ E</geo>. </p><p n="163">On the <date>8th</date>, about two o'clock in the afternoon,* we saw land to the
                  northward, and about sunset came abreast of it, <pb n="78"/> at about the distance
                  of two leagues.* It appeared to be a double range of low woody islands joined
                  together by reefs, so as to form one island, in the form of an ellipsis or oval,
                  with a lake in the middle of it. The small islands and reefs that circumscribe the
                  lake have the appearance of a chain, and we therefore gave it the name of CHAIN
                  ISLAND. Its length seemed to be about five leagues, in the direction of N.W. and
                  S.E. and its breadth about five miles. The trees upon it appeared to be large, and
                  we saw smoke rising in different parts of it from among them, a certain sign that
                  it was inhabited. The middle of it lies in latitude <geo select="lat" n="22">17° 23′ S</geo>. and
                  longitude <geo select="lon" n="22">145° 54′ W</geo>. and is distant from Bird Island forty-five
                  leagues in the direction of W. by N. The variation here was, by several azimuths,
                  found to be <geo select="lon">4° 54′ E</geo>. </p><p n="164">*On the <date>10th</date>, having had a tempestuous night with thunder and rain, the
                  weather was hazy till about nine o'clock in the morning, when it cleared up, and
                  we saw the island to which Captain Wallis, who first discovered it, gave the name
                  of Osnaburgh Island, called by the natives Maitea, bearing N.W. by W. distant
                  about five leagues. It is a high round island, not above a league in circuit; in
                  some parts it is covered with trees, and in others a naked rock. In this direction
                  it looked like a high crown'd hat; but when it bears North, the top of it has more
                  the appearance of the roof of a house. We made its latitude to be <geo select="lat" n="23">17° 48′
                     S</geo>. its longitude <geo select="lon" n="23">148° 10′ W</geo>. and its distance from Chain
                  Island 44 leagues, in the direction of W. by S. </p><p n="165"><!--Page  [unnumbered]--></p><p n="166">[illustration] CHART OF THE ISLAND OTAHEITE, BY LIEUT. J.

                        Visit to Tootahah and Toubourai Tamaida, two Chiefs.</emph></l></head><p n="167">ABOUT one o'clock, on Monday the <date>10th of April</date>,* some of the people who
                  were looking out for the island to which we were bound, said they saw land ahead,
                  in that part of the horizon where it was expected to appear; but it was so faint
                  that, whether there was land in sight or not, remained a matter of dispute till
                  sunset. The next morning,* however, at six o'clock, we were convinced that those
                  who said they had discovered land, were not mistaken; it appeared to be very high
                  and mountainous, extending from W. by S. ½ S. to W. by N. ½ N. and we knew it to
                  be the same that Captain Wallis had called King George the III.'s Island. We were
                  delayed in our approach to it by light airs and calms,* so that in the morning of
                  the <date>12th</date> we were but little nearer than we had been the night before; but about
                  seven a breeze sprung up, and before eleven several canoes were seen making
                  towards the ship: there were but few of them, however, that would come near; and
                  the people in those that did, could not be persuaded to come on board. In every
                  canoe there were young plantains, and branches of a tree which the Indians call E'
                  Midho; these, as we afterwards learnt, were brought as tokens of peace and amity,
                  and the people in one of the canoes handed them up the sip's side, making signals
                     <pb n="80"/> at the same time with great earnestness,* which we did not
                  immediately understand; at length we guessed that they wished these symbols should
                  be placed in some conspicuous part of the ship; we, therefore, immediately stuck
                  them among the rigging, at which they expressed the greatest satisfaction. We then
                  purchased their cargoes, consisting of cocoa-nuts, and various kinds of fruit,
                  which after our long voyage were very acceptable. </p><p n="168">We stood on with an easy sail all night, with soundings from 22 fathom to
                  12,* and about seven o'clock in the morning we came to an anchor in 13 fathom, in
                  Port-royal bay, called by the natives Matavai. We were immediately surrounded by
                  the natives in their canoes, who gave us cocoa-nuts, fruit resembling apples,
                  bread-fruit, and some small fishes, in exchange for beads and other trifles. They
                  had with them a pig, which they would not part with for any thing but a hatchet,
                  and therefore we refused to purchase it; because, if we gave them a hatchet for a
                  pig now, we knew they would never afterwards sell one for less, and we could not
                  afford to buy as many as it was probable we should want at that price. The
                  bread-fruit grows on a tree that is about the size of a middling oak: its leaves
                  are frequently a foot and an half long, of an oblong shape, deeply sinuated like
                  those of the fig-tree, which they resemble in consistence and colour, and in the
                  exuding of a white milky juice upon being broken. The fruit is about the size and
                  shape of a child's head, and the surface is reticulated not much unlike a truffle:
                  it is covered with a thin skin, and has a core about as big as the handle of a
                  small knife: the eatable part lies between the skin and the core; it is as white
                  as snow, and somewhat of the consistence of new bread: it must be roasted before
                  it is eaten, being first divided into three or four parts:
                  <!--Page  [unnumbered]--></p><p n="169">[illustration] <!--Page  [unnumbered]--> [illustration] <pb n="81"/> its
                  taste is insipid,* with a slight sweetness somewhat resembling that of the crumb
                  of wheaten-bread mixed with a Jerusalem artichoke. Among others who came off to
                  the ship was an elderly man, whose name, as we learnt afterwards, was OWHAW, and
                  who was immediately known to Mr. Gore, and several others who had been here with
                  Captain Wallis; as I was informed that he had been very useful to them, I took him
                  on board the ship with some others, and was particularly attentive to gratify him,
                  as I hoped he might also be useful to us. </p><p n="170">As our stay here was not likely to be very short, and as it was necessary
                  that the merchandise which we had brought for traffic with the natives should not
                  diminish in its value, which it would certainly have done, if every person had
                  been left at liberty to give what he pleased for such things as he should
                  purchase; at the same time that confusion and quarrels must necessarily have
                  arisen from there being no standard at market: I drew up the following rules, and
                  ordered that they should be punctually observed. </p><p n="171">Rules to be observed by every person in or belonging to his Majesty's Bark
                  the Endeavour, for the better establishing a regular and uniform trade for
                  provision,&amp;, with the inhabitants of George's Island. </p><p n="172">I. To endeavour, by every fair means, to cultivate a friendship with the
                  natives; and to treat them with all imaginable humanity. </p><p n="173">II. A proper person, or persons, will be appointed to trade with the
                  natives for all manner of provisions, fruit, and other productions of the earth;
                  and no officer or seaman, or other person belonging to the ship, excepting such as
                  are so appointed, shall trade or offer to trade for any sort <pb n="82"/> of
                  provision,* fruit, or other productions of the earth, unless they have leave so to
                  do. </p><p n="174">III. Every person employed on shore, on any duty whatsoever, is strictly
                  to attend to the same; and if by any neglect he loseth any of his arms, or working
                  tools, or suffers them to be stolen, the full value thereof will be charged
                  against his pay, according to the custom of the navy in such cases, and he shall
                  receive such farther punishment as the nature of the offence may deserve. </p><p n="175">IV. The same penalty will be inflicted on every person who is found to
                  embezzle, trade, or offer to trade, with any part of the ship's stores of what
                  nature soever. </p><p n="176">V. No sort of iron, or any thing that is made of iron, or any sort of
                  cloth, or other useful or necessary articles, are to be given in exchange for any
                  thing but provision. </p><p n="177">J. COOK. </p><p n="178">As soon as the ship was properly secured, I went on shore with Mr. Banks
                  and Dr. Solander, a party of men under arms, and our friend Owhaw. We were
                  received from the boat by some hundreds of the inhabitants, whose looks at least
                  gave us welcome, though they were struck with such awe, that the first who
                  approached us crouched so low that he almost crept upon his hands and knees. It is
                  remarkable that he, like the people in the canoes, presented to us the same symbol
                  of peace that is known to have been in use among the ancient and mighty nations of
                  the northern hemisphere, the green branch of a tree. We received it with looks and
                  gestures of kindness and satisfaction; and observing that each of them held one in
                  his hand, we immediately gathered every one a bough, and carried it in our hands
                  in the same manner. </p><p n="179"><pb n="83"/>They marched with us about half a mile towards the place where the
                  Dolphin had watered, conducted by Owhaw;* they then made a full stop, and having
                  laid the ground bare, by clearing away all the plants that grew upon it, the
                  principal persons among them threw their green branches upon the naked spot, and
                  made signs that we should do the same; we immediately showed our readiness to
                  comply, and to give a greater solemnity to the rite, the marines were drawn up,
                  and marching in order, each dropped his bough upon those of the Indians, and we
                  followed their example. We then proceeded, and when we came to the watering-place
                  it was intimated to us by signs, that we might occupy that ground, but it happened
                  not to be fit for our purpose. During our walk they had shaken off their first
                  timid sense of our superiority, and were become familiar: they went with us from
                  the watering-place and took a circuit through the woods: as we went along, we
                  distributed beads and other small presents among them, and had the satisfaction to
                  see that they were much gratified. Our circuit was not less than four or five
                  miles, through groves of trees, which were loaded with cocoa-nuts and bread-fruit,
                  and afforded the most grateful shade. Under these trees were the habitations of
                  the people, most of them being only a roof without walls, and the whole scene
                  realized the poetical fables of Arcadia. We remarked however, not without some
                  regret, that in all our walk we had seen only two hogs, and not a single fowl.
                  Those of our company who had been here with the Dolphin told us, that none of the
                  people whom we had yet seen were of the first class; they suspected that the
                  chiefs had removed, and upon carrying us to the place where what they called the
                  Queen's palace had stood, we found that no traces of it were left. We determined
                  therefore to return in the morning, and endeavour. to find out the Noblesse in
                  their retreats. </p><p n="180"><pb n="84"/>*In the morning, however, before we could leave the ship, several
                  canoes came about us, most of them from the westward, and two of them were filled
                  with people, who by their dress and deportment appeared to be of a superior rank:
                  two of these came on board, and each singled out his friend; one of them, whose
                  name we found to be MATAHAH, fixed upon Mr. Banks, and the other upon me: this
                  ceremony consisted in taking off great part of their clothes and putting them upon
                  us. In return for this, we presented each of them with a hatcher and some beads.
                  Soon, after they made signs for us to go with them to the places where they lived,
                  pointing to the S.W.; and as I was desirous of finding a more commodious harbour,
                  and making farther trial of the disposition of the people, I consented. </p><p n="181">I ordered out two boats, and with Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, the other
                  gentlemen, and our two Indian friends, we embarked for our expedition. After
                  rowing about a league, they made signs that we should go on shore, and gave us to
                  understand that this was the place of their residence. We accordingly landed,
                  among several hundreds of the natives, who conducted us into a house of much
                  greater length than any we had seen. When we entered, we saw a middle-aged man,
                  whose name we afterwards discovered to be TOOTAHAH; mats were immediately spread,
                  and we were desired to sit down over against him. Soon after we were seated, he
                  ordered a cock and hen to be brought out, which he presented to Mr. Banks and me;
                  we accepted the present, and in a short time each of us received a piece of cloth,
                  perfumed after their manner, by no means disagreeably, which they took great pains
                  to make us remark. The piece presented to Mr. Banks was eleven yards long and two
                  wide; in return for which, he gave a laced silk neckcloth, which he happened to
                  have on, and a linen pocket handkerchief: <pb n="85"/> Tootahah immediately
                  dressed himself in this new finery,* with an air of perfect complacency and
                  satisfaction. But it is now time that I should take some notice of the ladies. </p><p n="182">Soon after the interchanging of our presents with Tootahah, they attended
                  us to several large houses, in which we walked about with great freedom: they
                  shewed us all the civility of which, in our situation, we could accept; and, on
                  their part, seemed to have no scruple that would have prevented its being carried
                  farther. The houses, which as I have observed before, are all open, except a roof,
                  afforded no place of retirement; but the ladies, by frequently pointing to the
                  mats upon the ground, and sometimes seating themselves and drawing us down upon
                  them, left us no room to doubt of their being much less jealous of observation
                  than we were. </p><p n="183">We now took leave of our friendly Chief, and directed our course along the
                  shore; when we had walked about a mile, we met, at the head of a great number of
                  people, another Chief, whose name was TUBOURAI TAMAIDE, with whom we were also to
                  ratify a treaty of peace, with the ceremony of which we were now become better
                  acquainted. Having received the branch which he presented to us, and given another
                  in return, We laid our hands upon our left breasts, and pronounced the word Taio,
                  which we supposed to signify friend; the Chief then gave us to understand, that if
                  we chose to eat, he had victuals ready for us. We accepted his offer, and dined
                  very heartily upon fish, bread-fruit, cocoa-nuts and plantains, dressed after
                  their manner; they eat some of their fish raw, and raw fish was offered to us, but
                  we declined that part of the entertainment. </p><p n="184">During this visit a wife of our noble host, whose name was TOMIO, did Mr.
                  Banks the honour to place herself upon <pb n="86"/> the same matt,* close by him.
                  Tomio was not in the first bloom of her youth, nor did she appear to have been
                  ever remarkable for her beauty: he did not therefore, I believe, pay her the most
                  flattering attention: it happened too, as a farther mortification to this lady,
                  that seeing a very pretty girl among the crowd, he, not adverting to the dignity
                  of his companion, beckoned her to come to him: the girl, after some entreaty,
                  complied, and sat down on the other side of him; he loaded her with beads, and
                  every showy trifle that would please her: his Princess, though she was somewhat
                  mortified at the preference that was given to her rival, did not discontinue her
                  civilities, but still assiduously supplied him with the milk of the cocoa-nut, and
                  such other dainties as were in her reach. This scene might possibly have become
                  more curious and interesting, if it had not been suddenly interrupted by an
                  interlude of a more serious kind. Just at this time, Dr. Solander and Mr.
                  Monkhouse complained that their pockets had been picked. Dr. Solander had lost an
                  opera glass in a shagreen case, and Mr. Monkhouse his snuff-box. This incident
                  unfortunately put an end to the good-humour of the company. Complaint of the
                  injury was made to the Chief; and, to give it weight, Mr. Banks started up, and
                  hastily struck the but end of his firelock upon the ground: this action, and the
                  noise that accompanied it, struck the whole assembly with a panic, and every one
                  of the natives rap out of the house with the utmost precipitation, except the
                  Chief, three women, and two or three others, who appeared by their dress to be of
                  a superior rank. </p><p n="185">The Chief, with a mixture of confusion and concern, took Mr. Banks by the
                  hand, and led him to a large quantity of cloth, which lay at the other end of the
                  house: this he offered <pb n="87"/> to him piece by piece, intimating by signs,*
                  that if that would atone for the wrong which had been done, he might take any part
                  of it, or, if he pleased, the whole. Mr. Banks put it by, and gave him to
                  understand, that he wanted nothing but what had been dishonestly taken away.
                  Toubourai Tamaide then went hastily out, leaving Mr. Banks with his wife Tomio,
                  who during the whole scene of terror and confusion had kept constantly at his
                  side, and intimating his desire that he should wait there till his return. Mr.
                  Banks accordingly sat down, and conversed with her, as well as he could by signs,
                  about half an hour. The chief then came back with the snuff-box and the case of
                  the opera glass in his hand, and, with a joy in his countenance that was painted
                  with a strength of expression which distinguishes these people from all others,
                  delivered them to the owners. The case of the opera glass, however, upon being
                  opened, was found to be empty; upon this discovery, his countenance changed in a
                  moment; and catching Mr. Banks again by the hand, he rushed out of the house,
                  without uttering any sound, and led him along the shore, walking with great
                  rapidity: when they had got about a mile from the house, a woman met him and gave
                  him a piece of cloth, which he hastily took from her, and continued to press
                  forward with it in his hand. Dr. Solander and Mr. Monkhouse had followed them, and
                  they came at length to a house where they were received by a woman, to whom he
                  gave the cloth, and intimated to the gentlemen that they should give her some
                  beads. They immediately complied; and the beads and cloth being deposited upon the
                  floor, the woman went out, and in about half an hour returned with the opera
                  glass, expressing the same joy upon the occasion that had before been expressed by
                  the Chief. The beads were now returned, with an inflexible <pb n="88"/> resolution
                  not to accept them;* and the cloth was, with with the same pertinacity, forced
                  upon Dr. Solander, as a recompence for the injury that had been done him. He could
                  not avoid accepting the cloth, but insisted in his turn upon giving a new present
                  of beads to the woman. It will not perhaps be easy to account for all the steps
                  that were taken in the recovery of this glass and snuff-box; but this cannot be
                  thought strange, considering that the scene of action was among a people whose
                  language, policy and connections are even now but imperfectly known; upon the
                  whole, however, they show an intelligence and influence which would do honour to
                  any system of government, however regular and improved. In the evening, about six
                  o'clock, we returned to the ship. </p></div><pb n="89"/><div type="chapter" n="9"><head><l>CHAP.IX.</l><l><emph rend="italic"> A Place fixed upon for an Observatory and Fort: an

                        from several Chiefs on board and at the Fort, with some Account of the Music

                  seen the day before came on board, and brought with them, hogs, bread-fruit, and
                  other refreshments, for which we gave them hatchets and linen, and such things as
                  seemed to be most acceptable. </p><p n="187">As in my excursion to the westward, I had not found any more convenient
                  harbour than that in which we lay, I determined to go on shore and six upon some
                  spot, commanded by the ship's guns, where I might throw up a small fort for our
                  defence, and prepare for making our astronomical observation. </p><p n="188">I therefore took a party of men, and landed without delay, accompanied by
                  Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and the astronomer, Mr. Green. We soon fixed upon a part
                  of the sandy beach, on the N. E. point of the bay, which was in every respect
                  convenient for our purpose, and not near any habitation of the natives. Having
                  marked out the ground that we intended to occupy, a small tent belonging to Mr.
                  Banks was set up, which had been brought on shore for that purpose: by this time a
                  great number of the people had gathered about us; but, as it appeared, only to
                  look on, there <pb n="90"/> not being a single weapon of any kind among them.* I
                  intimated, however, that none of them were to come within the line I had drawn,
                  except one who appeared to be a chief, and Owhaw. To these two persons I addressed
                  myself by signs, and endeavoured to make them understand, that we wanted the
                  ground which we had marked out to sleep upon for a certain number of nights, and
                  that then we should go away. Whether I was understood I cannot certainly
                  determine; but the people behaved with a deference and respect that at once
                  pleased and surprised us: they sat down peaceably without the circle, and looked
                  on, without giving us any interruption, till we had done, which was upwards of two
                  hours. As we had seen no poultry, and but two hogs, in our walk when we were last
                  on shore at this place, we suspected that, upon our arrival, they had been driven
                  farther up the country; and the rather, as Owhaw was very importunate with us, by
                  signs, not to go into the woods, which, however, and partly for these reasons, we
                  were determined to do. Having therefore appointed the thirteen marines and a petty
                  officer to guard the tent, we set out, and a great number of the natives joined
                  our party. As we were crossing a little river that lay in our way we saw some
                  ducks, and Mr. Banks, as soon as he had got over, fired at them, and happened to
                  kill three at one shot: this struck them with the utmost terror, so that most of
                  them fell suddenly to the ground, as if they also had been shot at the same
                  discharge: it was not long, however, before they recovered from their fright, and
                  we continued our rout, but we had not gone far before we were alarmed by the
                  report of two pieces, which were fired by the guard at the tent. We had then
                  straggled a little distance from each other, but Owhaw immediately called us
                  together, and by waving his hand, sent away every Indian who followed us except
                  three, each of whom, as a pledge of peace on their <pb n="91"/> part, and an
                  entreaty that there might be peace on ours,* hastily broke a branch from the
                  trees, and came to us with it in their hands. As we had too much reason to fear
                  that some mischief had happened, we hasted back to the tent, which was not distant
                  above half a mile, and when we came up, we found it entirely deserted, except by
                  our own people. </p><p n="189">It appeared, that one of the Indians who remained about the tent after we
                  left it, had watched his opportunity, and, taking the centry unawares, had
                  snatched away his musquet. Upon this, the petty officer, a midshipman, who
                  commanded the party, perhaps from a sudden fear of farther violence, perhaps from
                  the natural petulance of power newly acquired, and perhaps from a brutality in his
                  nature, ordered the marines to fire: the men, with as little consideration or
                  humanity as the officer, immediately discharged their pieces among the thickest of
                  the flying crowd, consisting of more than a hundred; and observing that the thief
                  did not fall, pursued him, and shot him dead. We afterwards learnt, that none of
                  the others were either killed or wounded. </p><p n="190">Owhaw, who had never left us, observing that we were now totally deserted,
                  got together a few of those who had fled, though not without some difficulty, and
                  ranged them about us: we endeavoured to justify our people as well as we could,
                  and to convince the Indians that if they did no wrong to us, we should do no wrong
                  to them: they went away without any appearance of distrust or resentment; and
                  having struck our tent, we returned to the ship, but by no means satisfied with
                  the transactions of the day. </p><p n="191">Upon questioning our people more particularly, whose conduct they soon
                  perceived we could not approve, they alleged that the centinel whose musquet was
                  taken away, was violently assaulted and thrown down, and that a push <pb n="90"/>
                  <!--$B!R(B1 page duplicate$B!S(B--><pb n="91"/>
                  <!--$B!R(B〈1 page duplicate$B!S(B--><pb n="92"/> was afterwards made at him by the man who took the musquet,* before
                  any command was given to fire. It was also suggested, that Owhaw had suspicions,
                  at least, if not certain knowlege, that something would be attempted against our
                  people at the tent, which made him so very earnest in his endeavours to prevent
                  our leaving it; others imputed his importunity to his desire that we should
                  confine ourselves to the beach: and it was remarked that neither Owhaw, nor the
                  Chiefs who remained with us after he had sent the rest of the people away, would
                  have inferred the breach of peace from the firing at the tent, if they had had no
                  reason to suspect that some injury had been offered by their countrymen;
                  especially as Mr. Banks had just fired at the ducks: and yet that they did infer a
                  breach of peace from that incident, as was manifest from their waving their hands
                  for the people to disperse, and instantly pulling green branches from the trees.
                  But what were the real circumstances of this unhappy affair, and whether either
                  and which of these conjectures were true, can never certainly be known. </p><p n="192">*The next morning but few of the natives were seen upon the beach, and not
                  one of them came off to the ship. This convinced us that our endeavours to quiet
                  their apprehensions had not been effectual; and we remarked with particular
                  regret, that we were deserted even by Owhaw, who had hitherto been so constant in
                  his attachment, and so active in renewing the peace that had been broken. </p><p n="193">Appearances being thus unfavourable, I warped the ship nearer to the
                  shore, and moored her in such a manner as to command all the N.E. part of the bay,
                  particularly the place which I had marked out for the building a fort. In the
                  evening, however, I went on shore with only a boat's crew, and some of the
                  Gentlemen: the natives gathered about us, but <pb n="93"/> not in the same number
                  as before;* there were I believe between thirty and forty, and they trafficked
                  with us for cocoa-nuts and other fruit, to all appearance as friendly as ever. </p><p n="194">On the <date>17th</date>, early in the morning,* we had the misfortune to lose Mr.
                  Buchan, the person whom Mr. Banks had brought out as a painter of landscapes and
                  figures. He was a sober, diligent, and ingenious young man, and greatly regretted
                  by Mr. Banks; who hoped, by his means, to have gratified his friends in England
                  with representations of this country and its inhabitants, which no other person on
                  board could delineate with the same accuracy and elegance. He had always been
                  subject to epileptic fits, one of which seized him on the mountains of Terra del
                  Fuego, and this disorder being aggravated by a bilious complaint which he
                  contracted on board the ship, at length put an end to his life. It was at first
                  proposed to bury him on shore, but Mr. Banks thinking, that it might perhaps give
                  offence to the natives, with whose customs we were then wholly unacquainted, we
                  committed his body to the sea, with as much decency and solemnity as our
                  circumstances and situation would admit. </p><p n="195">In the forenoon of this day we received a visit from Tubourai Tamaide and
                  Tootahah, our Chiefs, from the West: they brought with them, as emblems of peace,
                  not branches of plantain, but two young trees, and would not venture on board till
                  these had been received, having probably been alarmed by the mischief which had
                  been done at the tent. Each of them also brought, as propitiatory gifts, some
                  bread-fruit, and a hog ready dressed: this was a most acceptable present, as we
                  perceived that hogs were not always to be got; and in return we gave to each of
                  our noble benefactors a hatchet and a nail. In the evening we went on shore and
                  set up a tent, in which Mr. Green and myself spent the night, <pb n="94"/> in
                  order to observe an eclipse of the first satellite of Jupiter;* but the weather
                  becoming cloudy, we were disappointed. </p><p n="196">*On the <date>18th</date>, at day-break, I went on shore, with as many people as could
                  possibly be spared from the ship, and began to erect our fort. While some were
                  employed in throwing up intrenchments, others were busy in cutting pickets and
                  fascines, which the natives, who soon gathered round us as they had been used to
                  do, were so far from hindering, that many of them voluntarily assisted us,
                  bringing the pickets and fascines from the wood where they had been cut, with
                  great alacrity: we had indeed been so scrupulous of invading their property, that
                  we purchased every stake which was used upon this occasion, and cut down no tree
                  till we had first obtained their consent. The soil where we constructed our fort
                  was sandy, and this made it necessary to strengthen the intrenchments with wood;
                  three sides were to be fortified in this manner; the fourth was bounded by a
                  river, upon the banks of which I proposed to place a proper number of water-casks.
                  This day we served pork to the ship's company for the first time, and the Indians
                  brought down so much bread-fruit and cocoa-nuts, that we found it necessary to
                  send away part of them unbought, and to acquaint them, by signs, that we should
                  want no more for two days to come. Every thing was purchased this day with beads:
                  a single bead, as big as a pea, being the purchase of five or six cocoa-nuts, and
                  as many of the bread-fruit. Mr. Banks's tent was got up before night within the
                  works, and he slept on shore for the first time. Proper centries were placed round
                  it, but no Indian attempted to approach it the whole night. </p><p n="197">*The next morning, our friend Tubourai Tamaide made Mr. Banks a visit at
                  the tent, and brought with him not <pb n="95"/> only his wife and family, but the
                  roof of a house,* and several materials for setting it up, with furniture and
                  implements of various kinds, intending, as we understood him, to take up his
                  residence in our neighbourhood: this instance of his confidence and good-will gave
                  us great pleasure, and we determined to strengthen his attachment to us by every
                  means in our power. Soon after his arrival, he took Mr. Banks by the hand, and
                  leading him out of the line, signified that he should accompany him into the
                  woods. Mr. Banks readily consented, and having walked with him about a quarter of
                  a mile, they arrived at a kind of awning which he had already set up, and which
                  seemed to be his occasional habitation. Here he unfolded a bundle of his country
                  cloth, and taking out two garments, one of red cloth, and the other of very neat
                  matting, he clothed Mr. Banks in them, and without any other ceremony, immediately
                  conducted him back to the tent. His attendants soon after brought him some pork
                  and bread-fruit, which he eat, dipping his meat into salt water instead of sauce:
                  after his meal he retired to Mr. Banks's bed, and slept about an hour. In the
                  afternoon, his wife Tomio brought to the tent a young man about two and twenty
                  years of age, of a very comely appearance, whom they both seemed to acknowledge as
                  their son, though we afterwards discovered that he was not so. In the evening,
                  this young man and another Chief, who had also paid us a visit, went away to the
                  westward, but Tubourai Tamaide and his wife returned to the awning in the skirts
                  of the wood. </p><p n="198">Our Surgeon, Mr. Monkhouse, having walked out this evening, reported, that
                  he had seen the body of the man who had been shot at the tents, which he said was
                  wrapped in cloth, and placed on a kind of bier, supported by stakes, under a roof
                  that seemed to have been set up for the purpose: <pb n="96"/> that near it were
                  deposited some instrument of war,* and other things, which he would particularly
                  have examined but for the stench of the body, which was intolerable. He said, that
                  he saw also two more sheds of the same kind, in one of which were the bones of a
                  human body that had lain till they were quite dry. We discovered afterwards, that
                  this was the way in which they usually disposed of their dead. </p><p n="199">A kind of market now began to be kept just without the lines, and was
                  plentifully supplied with every thing but pork. Tubourai Tamaide was our constant
                  guest, imitating our manners, even to the using of a knife and fork, which he did
                  very handily. </p><p n="200">As my curiosity was excited by Mr. Monkhouse's account of the situation of
                  the man who had been shot, I took an opportunity to go with some others to see it.
                  I found the shed under which his body lay, close by the house in which he resided
                  when he was alive, some others being not more than ten yards distant; it was about
                  15 feet long, and 11 broad, and of a proportionable height: one end was wholly
                  open, and the other end, and the two sides, were partly enclosed with a kind of
                  wicker work. The bier on which the corps was deposited, was a frame of wood like
                  that in which the sea beds, called cotts, are placed, with a matted bottom, and
                  supported by four posts, at the height of about five feet from the ground. The
                  body was covered first with a matt, and then with white cloth; by the side of it
                  lay a wooden mace, one of their weapons of war, and near the head of it, which lay
                  next to the close end of the shed, lay two cocoa nut-shells, such as are sometimes
                  used to carry water in; at the other end a bunch of green leaves, with some dried
                  twigs, all tied together, were stuck in the ground, by which lay a stone <pb n="97"/> about as big as a cocoa-nut:* near these lay one of the young plantain
                  trees, which are used for emblems of peace, and close by it a stone ax. At the
                  open end of the shed also hung, in several strings, a great number of palm-nuts,
                  and without the shed, was stuck upright in the ground, the stem of a plantain tree
                  about five feet high, upon the top of which was placed a cocoa nut-shell full of
                  fresh water: against the side of one of the posts hung a small bag, containing a
                  few pieces of bread-fruit ready roasted, which were not all put in at the same
                  time, for some of them were fresh, and others stale. I took notice that several of
                  the natives observed us with a mixture of solicitude and jealousy in their
                  countenances, and by their gestures expressed uneasiness when we went near the
                  body, standing themselves at a little distance while we were making our
                  examination, and appearing to be pleased when we came away. </p><p n="201">Our residence on more would by no means have been disagreeable if we had
                  not been incessantly tormented by the flies, which, among other mischief, made it
                  almost impossible for Mr. Parkinson, Mr. Banks's natural history painter, to work;
                  for they not only covered his subject so as that no part of its surface could be
                  seen, but even eat the colour off the paper as fast as he could lay it on. We had
                  recourse to musquito nets and fly-traps, which, though they made the inconvenience
                  tolerable, were very far from removing it. </p><p n="202">On the <date>22d</date>,* Tootahah gave us a specimen of the music of this country;
                  four persons performed upon flutes which had only two stops, and therefore could
                  not sound more than four notes, by half tones: they were sounded like our German
                  flutes, except that the performer, instead of applying it <pb n="98"/> to his
                  mouth,* blew into it with one nostril, while he stopped the other with his thumb:
                  to these instruments four other persons sung, and kept very good time; but only
                  one tune was played during the whole concert. </p><p n="203">Several of the natives brought us axes, which they had received from on
                  board the Dolphin, to grind and repair; but among others, there was one which
                  became the subject of much speculation, as it appeared to be French: after much
                  enquiry, we learnt that a ship had been here between our arrival and the departure
                  of the Dolphin, which we then conjectured to have been a Spaniard, but now know to
                  have been the Boudeuse, commanded by M. Bougainville. </p></div><pb n="99"/><div type="chapter" n="10"><head><l>CHAP.X.</l><l><emph rend="italic"> An Excursion to the Eastward, an Account of several
                        Incidents that happened both on board and on shore, and of the first
                        Interview with Oberea, the Person who, when the Dolphin was here, was
                        supposed to be Queen of the Island, with a Description of the Fort.</emph></l></head><p n="204">ON the <date>24th</date>,* Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander examined the country for several
                  miles along the shore to the eastward: for about two miles it was flat and
                  fertile; after that the hills stretched quite to the water's edge, and a little
                  farther ran out into the sea, so that they were obliged to climb over them. These
                  hills, which were barren, continued for about three miles more, and then
                  terminated in a large plain, which was full of good houses, and people who
                  appeared to live in great affluence. In this place there was a river, much more
                  considerable than that at our fort, which issued from a deep and beautiful valley,
                  and, where our travellers crossed it, though at some distance from the sea, was
                  near one hundred yards wide. About a mile beyond this river the country became
                  again barren, the rocks every where projecting into the sea, for which reason they
                  resolved to return. Just as they had formed this resolution, one of the natives
                  offered them refreshment, which they accepted. They found this man to be of a kind
                  that has been described by various authors, as mixed with many nations, but
                  distinct from them all. His skin was of a dead white, without the least appearance
                  of what is called complexion, though some parts of his <pb n="100"/> body were in
                  a small degree less white than others:* his hair, eye-brows, and beard were as
                  white as his skin; his eyes appeared as if they were bloodshot, and he seemed to
                  be very short-sighted. </p><p n="205">At their return they were met by Tubourai Tamaide, and his women, who, at
                  seeing them, felt a joy which not being able to express, they burst into tears,
                  and wept some time before their passion could be restrained. </p><p n="206">This evening Dr. Solander lent his knife to one of these women,* who
                  neglected to return it, and the next morning Mr. Banks's also was missing; upon
                  this occasion I must bear my testimony, that the people of this country, of all
                  ranks, men and women, are the errantest thieves upon the face of the earth: the
                  very day after we arrived here, when they came on board us, the chiefs were
                  employed in stealing what they could in the cabbin, and their dependants were no
                  less industrious in other parts of the ship; they snatched up every thing that it
                  was possible for them to secrete till they got on shore, even to the glass ports,
                  two of which they carried off undetected. Tubourai Tamaide was the only one except
                  Tootahah who had not been found guilty, and the presumption, arising from this
                  circumstance, that he was exempt from a vice, of which the whole nation besides
                  were guilty, cannot be supposed to outweigh strong appearances to the contrary.
                  Mr. Banks therefore, though not without some reluctance, accused him of having
                  stolen his knife: he solemnly and steadily denied that he knew any thing of it;
                  upon which Mr. Banks made him understand, that whoever had taken it, he was
                  determined to have it returned: upon this resolute declaration, one of the natives
                  who was present, produced a rag in which three knives were very carefully tied up.
                  One was that which Dr. Solander <pb n="101"/> had lent to the woman,* another was
                  a table knife belonging to me, and the owner of the third was not known. With
                  these the chief immediately set out, in order to make restitution of them to their
                  owners at the tents. Mr. Banks remained with the women, who expressed great
                  apprehensions that some mischief was designed against their lord. When he came to
                  the tents he restored one of the knives to Dr. Solander and another to me, the
                  third not being owned, and then began to search for Mr. Banks's in all the places
                  where he had ever seen it. After some time, one of Mr. Banks's servants,
                  understanding what he was about, immediately fetched his master's knife, which it
                  seems he had laid by the day before, and till now knew nothing of its having been
                  missed. Tubourai Tamaide, upon this demonstration of his innocence, expressed the
                  strongest emotions of mind, both in his looks and gestures; the tears started from
                  his eyes, and he made signs, with the knife, that, if he was ever guilty of such
                  an action as had been imputed to him, he would submit to have his throat cut. He
                  then rushed out of the lines, and returned hastily to Mr. Banks, with a
                  countenance that severely reproached him with his suspicions. Mr. Banks soon
                  understood that the knife had been received from his servant, and was scarcely
                  less affected at what had happened than the Chief; he felt himself to be the
                  guilty person, and was very desirous to atone for his fault. The poor Indian,
                  however violent his passions, was a stranger to sullen resentment; and upon Mr.
                  Banks's spending a little time familiarly with him, and making him a few trifling
                  presents, he forgot the wrong that had been done him, and was perfectly
                  reconciled. </p><p n="207">Upon this occasion it may be observed, that these people have a knowlege
                  of right and wrong from the mere dictates of natural conscience; and involuntarily
                  condemn themselves <pb n="102"/> when they do that to others,* which they would
                  condemn others for doing to them. That Tubourai Tamaide felt the force of moral
                  obligation, is certain; for the imputation of an action which he considered as
                  indifferent, would not, when it appeared to be groundless, have moved him with
                  such excess of passion. We must indeed estimate the virtue of these people, by the
                  only standard of morality, the conformity of their conduct to what in their
                  opinion as right; but we must not hastily conclude that theft is a testimony of
                  the same depravity in them that it is in us, in the instances in which our people
                  were sufferers by their dishonesty; for their temptation was such, as to surmount
                  would be considered as a proof of uncommon integrity among those who have more
                  knowlege, better principles, and stronger motives to resist the temptations of
                  illicit advantage: an Indian among penny knives, and beads, or even nails and
                  broken glass, is in the same state of trial with the meanest servant in Europe
                  among unlocked coffers of jewels and gold. </p><p n="208">*On the <date>26th</date>, I mounted six swivel guns upon the fort, which I was sorry
                  to see struck the natives with dread: some fishermen who lived upon the point
                  removed farther off, and Owhaw told us, by signs, that in four days we should fire
                  great guns. </p><p n="209">*On the <date>27th</date>, Tubourai Tamaide, with a friend, who eat with a voracity
                  that I never saw before, and the three women that usually attended him, whose
                  names were TERAPO, TIRAO, and OMIE, dined at the fort: in the evening they took
                  their leave, and set out for the house which Tubourai Tamaide had set up in the
                  skirts of the wood; but in less than a quarter of an hour he returned in great
                  emotion, and hastily seizing Mr. Banks's arm, made signs that he should follow
                  him. Mr. Banks immediately complied, and <pb n="103"/> they soon came up to a
                  place where they found the ship's butcher, with a reaping-hook in his hand:* here
                  the Chief stopped, and, in a transport of rage which rendered his signs scarcely
                  intelligible, intimated that the butcher had threatened, or attempted, to cut his
                  wife's throat with the reaping-hook. Mr. Banks then signified to him, that if he
                  could fully explain the offence, the man should be punished. Upon this he became
                  more calm, and made Mr. Banks understand that the offender, having taken a fancy
                  to a stone hatchet which lay in his house, had offered to purchase it of his wife
                  for a nail: that she having refused to part with it upon any terms, he had catched
                  it up, and throwing down the nail, threatened to cut her throat if she made any
                  resistance: to prove this charge the hatchet and the nail were produced, and the
                  butcher had so little to say in his defence that there was not the least reason to
                  doubt of its truth. </p><p n="210">Mr. Banks having reported this matter to me, I took an opportunity, when
                  the Chief and his women, with other Indians, were on board the ship, to call up
                  the butcher, and after a recapitulation of the charge and the proof, I gave orders
                  that he should be punished, as well to prevent other offences of the same kind, as
                  to acquit Mr. Banks of his promise; the Indians saw him stripped and tied up to
                  the rigging with a fixed attention, waiting in silent suspence for the event; but
                  as soon as the first stroke was given, they interfered with great agitation,
                  earnestly intreating that the rest of the punishment might be remitted: to this,
                  however, for many reasons, I could not consent, and when they found that they
                  could not prevail by their intercession, they gave vent to their pity by tears. </p><p n="211">Their tears indeed, like those of children, were always ready to express
                  any passion that was strongly excited, and <pb n="104"/> like those of children
                  they also appeared to be forgotten as soon as shed;* of which the following among
                  many others, is a remarkable instance. Very early in the morning of the <date>28th</date>, even
                  before it was day, a great number of them came down to the fort, and Terapo being
                  observed among the women on the outside of the gate, Mr. Banks went out and
                  brought her in; he saw that the tears then stood in her eyes, and as soon as she
                  entered they began to flow in great abundance: he enquired earnestly the cause,
                  but instead of answering she took from under her garment a shark's tooth, and
                  struck it six or seven times into her head with great force; a profusion of blood
                  followed, and she talked loud, but in a most melancholy tone, for some minutes,
                  without at all regarding his enquiries, which he repeated with still more
                  impatience and concern, while the other Indians, to his great surprize, talked and
                  laughed, without taking the least notice of her distress. But her own behaviour
                  was still more extraordinary. As soon as the bleeding was over, she looked up with
                  a smile, and began to collect some small pieces of cloth, which during her
                  bleeding she had thrown down to catch the blood; as soon as she had picked them
                  all up, she carried them out of the tent, and threw them into the sea, carefully
                  dispersing them abroad, as if she wished to prevent the sight of them from
                  reviving the remembrance of what she had done. She then plunged into the river,
                  and after having washed her whole body, returned to the tents with the same gaiety
                  and cheerfulness as if nothing had happened. </p><p n="212">It is not indeed strange that the sorrows of these artless people should
                  be transient, any more than that their passions should be suddenly and strongly
                  expressed: what they feel they have never been taught either to disguise or
                  suppress, and having no habits of thinking which perpetually recal <pb n="105"/>
                  the past, and anticipate the future,* they are affected by all the changes of the
                  passing hour, and reflect the colour of the time, however frequently it may vary:
                  they have no project which is to be pursued from day to day, the subject of
                  unremitted anxiety and solicitude, that first rushes into the mind when they awake
                  in the morning, and is last dismissed when they sleep at night. Yet if we admit
                  that they are upon the whole happier than we, we must admit that the child is
                  happier than the man, and that we are losers by the perfection of our nature, the
                  increase of our knowlege, and the enlargement of our views. </p><p n="213">Canoes were continually coming in during all this forenoon, and the tents
                  at the fort were crowded with people of both sexes from different parts of the
                  Island. I was myself busy on board the ship, but Mr. Mollineux, our master, who
                  was one of those that made the last voyage in the Dolphin, went on shore. As soon
                  as he entered Mr. Banks's tent he fixed his eyes upon one of the women, who was
                  sitting there with great composure among the rest, and immediately declared her to
                  be the person who at that time was supposed to be Queen of the island; she also,
                  at the same time, acknowledging him to be one of the strangers whom she had seen
                  before. The attention of all present was now diverted from every other object, and
                  wholly engaged in considering a person who had made so distinguished a figure in
                  the accounts that had been given of this island by its first discoverers; and we
                  soon learnt that her name was OBEREA. She seemed to be about forty years of age,
                  and was not only tall, but of a large make; her skin was white, and there was an
                  uncommon intelligence and sensibility in her eyes: she appeared to have been
                  handsome when she was young, but at this time little more than memorials of her
                  beauty were left. </p><p n="214"><pb n="106"/>*As soon as her quality was known, an offer was made to conduct her
                  to the ship. Of this she readily accepted, and came on board with two men and
                  several women, who seemed to be all of her family; I received her with such marks
                  of distinction as I thought would gratify her most, and was not sparing of my
                  presents, among which this august personage seemed particularly delighted with a
                  child's doll. After some time spent on board, I attended her back to the shore;
                  and as soon as we landed, she presented me with a hog, and several bunches of
                  plantains, which she caused to be carried from her canoes up to the fort in a kind
                  of procession, of which she and myself brought up the rear. In our way to the fort
                  we met Tootahah, who, though not King, appeared to be at this time invested with
                  the sovereign authority; he seemed not to be well pleased with the distinction
                  that was shewed to the lady, and became so jealous when she produced her doll,
                  that to propitiate him it was thought proper to compliment him with another. At
                  this time he thought fit to prefer a doll to a hatchet; but this preference arose
                  only from a childish jealousy, which could not be soothed but by a gift of exactly
                  the same kind with that which had been presented to Oberea; for dolls in a very
                  short time were universally considered as trifles of no value. </p><p n="215">The men who had visited us from time to time had, without scruple, eaten
                  of our provisions; but the women had never yet been prevailed upon to taste a
                  morsel. To-day, however, though they refused the most pressing solicitations to
                  dine with the Gentlemen, they afterwards retired to the servants apartment, and
                  eat of plantains very heartily; a mystery of female oeconomy here, which none of
                  us could explain. </p><p n="216"><pb n="107"/>On the <date>29th</date>, not very early in the forenoon,* Mr. Banks went to pay
                  his court to Oberea, and was told that she was still asleep under the awning of
                  her canoe: thither therefore he went, intending to call her up, a liberty which he
                  thought he might take, without any danger of giving offence: but, upon looking
                  into her chamber, to his great astonishment, he found her in bed with a handsome
                  young fellow about five and twenty, whose name was OBADÉE: he retreated with some
                  haste and confusion, but was soon made to understand, that such amours gave no
                  occasion to scandal, and that Obadée was universally known to have been selected
                  by her as the object of her private favours. The lady being too polite to suffer
                  Mr. Banks to wait long in her antichamber, dressed herself with more than usual
                  expedition, and as a token of of special grace, clothed him in a suit of fine
                  cloth and proceeded with him to the tents. In the evening, Mr. Banks paid a visit
                  to Tubourai Tamaide, as he had often done before, by candle light, and was equally
                  grieved and surprized to find him and his family in a melancholy mood, and most of
                  them in tears: he endeavoured in vain to discover the cause, and therefore his
                  stay among them was but short. When he reported this circumstance to the officers
                  at the fort, they recollected that Owhaw had foretold, that in four days we should
                  fire our great guns; and as this was the eve of the third day, the situation in
                  which Tubourai Tamaide and his family had been found, alarmed them. The sentries
                  therefore were doubled at the fort, and the Gentlemen slept under arms; at two in
                  the morning, Mr. Banks himself went round the point, but found every thing so
                  quiet, that he gave up all suspicions of mischief intended by the natives as
                  groundless. We had however another source of security; our little fortification
                  was now complete. The north and <pb n="108"/> south sides consisted of a bank of
                  earth four feet and an half high on the inside,* and a ditch without ten feet
                  broad and six deep; on the west side, facing the bay, there was a bank of earth
                  four feet high, and pallisadoes upon that, but no ditch, the works here being at
                  high-water mark; on the east side, upon the bank of the river, was placed a double
                  row of water casks, filled with water; and as this was the weakest side, the two
                  four pounders were planted there, and six swivel guns were mounted so as to
                  command the only two avenues from the woods. Our garrison consisted of about five
                  and forty men with small arms, including the officers, and the gentlemen who
                  resided on shore; and our sentries were as well relieved as in the best regulated
                  frontier in Europe. </p><p n="217">*We continued our vigilance the next day, though we had no particular
                  reason to think it necessary; but about ten o'clock in the morning, Tomio came
                  running to the tents, with a mixture of grief and fear in her countenance, and
                  taking Mr. Banks, to whom they applied in every emergency and distress, by the
                  arm, intimated that Tubourai Tamaide was dying, in consequence of something which
                  our people had given him to eat, and that he must instantly go with her to his
                  house. Mr. Banks set out without delay, and found his Indian friend leaning his
                  head against a post, in an attitude of the utmost languor and despondency; the
                  people about him intimated that he had been vomiting, and brought out a leaf
                  folded up with great care, which they said contained some of the poison, by the
                  deleterious effects of which he was now dying. Mr. Banks hastily opened the leaf,
                  and upon examining its contents found them to be no other than a chew of tobacco,
                  which the chief had begged of some of our people, and which they had indiscreetly
                  given <pb n="109"/> him: he had observed that they kept it long in the mouth,* and
                  being desirous of doing the same, he had chewed it to powder, and swallowed the
                  spittle. During the examination of the leaf and its contents, he looked up at Mr.
                  Banks with the most piteous aspect, and intimated that he had but a very short
                  time to live. Mr. Banks, however, being now master of his disease, directed him to
                  drink plentifully of cocoa-nut milk, which in a short time put an end to his
                  sickness and apprehensions, and he spent the day at the fort with that uncommon
                  flow of cheerfulness and good-humour, which is always produced by a sudden and
                  unexpected relief from pain either of body or mind. </p><p n="218">Captain Wallis having brought home one of the adzes which these people,
                  having no metal of any kind, make of stone, Mr. Stevens, the Secretary to the
                  Admiralty, procured one to be made of iron in imitation of it, which I brought out
                  with me, to shew how much we excelled in making tools after their own fashion:
                  this I had not yet produced, as it never happened to come into my mind.* But on
                  the first of May, Tootahah coming on board about ten o'clock in the forenoon,
                  expressed a great curiosity to see the contents of every chest and drawer that was
                  in my cabbin; as I always made a point of gratifying him, I opened them
                  immediately, and having taken a fancy to many things that he saw, and collected
                  them together, he at last happened to cast his eye upon this adze; he instantly
                  snatched it up with the greatest eagerness, and putting away every thing which he
                  had before selected, he asked me whether I would let him have that: I readily
                  consented; and, as if he was afraid I should repent, he carried it off immediately
                  in a transport of joy, without making any other request, which whatever had been
                  our liberality was seldom the case. </p><p n="219"><pb n="110"/>*About noon, a Chief, who had dined with me a few days before,
                  accompanied by some of his women, came on board alone: I had observed that he was
                  fed by his women, but I made no doubt, that upon occasion he would condescend to
                  feed himself: in this, however, I found myself mistaken. When my noble guest was
                  seated, and the dinner upon the table, I helped him to some victuals: as I
                  observed that he did not immediately begin his meal, I pressed him to eat: but he
                  still continued to sit motionless like a statue, without attempting to put a
                  single morsel into his mouth, and would certainly have gone without his dinner, if
                  one of the servants had not fed him. </p></div><pb n="111"/><div type="chapter" n="11"><head><l>CHAP.XI.</l><l><emph rend="italic"> The Observatory set up; the Quadrant stolen, and

                  and took the astronomical quadrant, with some other instruments on shore, for the
                  first time. </p><p n="221">The next morning, about nine o'clock,* I went on shore with Mr. Green to
                  fix the quadrant in a situation for use, when to our inexpressible surprize and
                  concern it was not to be found. It had been deposited in the tent which was
                  reserved for my use, where, as I passed the night on board, nobody slept: it had
                  never been taken out of the packing-case, which was eighteen inches square, and
                  the whole was of considerable weight; a sentinel had been posted the whole night
                  within five yards of the tent door, and none of the other instruments were
                  missing. We at first suspected that it might have been stolen by some of our own
                  people, who seeing a deal box, and not knowing the contents, might think it
                  contained nails, or some other subjects of traffic with the natives. A large
                  reward was therefore offered to any one who could find it, as, without this, we
                  could not perform the service for which our voyage was principally undertaken. Our
                  search in the mean time was not confined to the fort and the places adjacent, but
                  as the case might possibly have been carried back to the ship, if any of our <pb n="112"/> own people had been the thieves,* the most diligent search was made
                  for it on board; all the parties however returned without any news of the
                  quadrant. Mr. Banks, therefore, who upon such occasions declined neither labour
                  nor risk, and who had more influence over the Indians than any of us, determined
                  to go in search of it into the woods; he hoped, that if it had been stolen by the
                  natives, he should find it wherever they had opened the box, as they would
                  immediately discover that to them it would be wholly useless: or, if in this
                  expectation he should be disappointed, that he might recover it by the ascendancy
                  he had acquired over the Chiefs. He set out, accompanied by a midshipman and Mr.
                  Green, and as he was crossing the river he was met by Tubourai Tamaide, who
                  immediately made the figure of a triangle with three bits of straw upon his hand.
                  By this Mr. Banks knew that the Indians were the thieves; and that, although they
                  had opened the case, they were not disposed to part with the contents. No time was
                  therefore to be lost, and Mr. Banks made Tubourai Tamaide understand, that he must
                  instantly go with him to the place whither the quadrant had been carried; he
                  consented, and they set out together to the eastward, the Chief inquiring at every
                  house which they passed after the thief by name: the people readily told him which
                  way he was gone, and how long it was since he had been there: the hope which this
                  gave them that they should overtake him, supported them under their fatigue, and
                  they pressed forward, sometimes walking, sometimes running, though the weather was
                  intolerably hot; when they had climbed a hill at the distance of about four miles,
                  their conductor shewed them a point full three miles farther, and gave them to
                  understand that they were not to expect the instrument till they had got thither.
                  Here they paused; they had no arms, except a pair of pistols, which <pb n="113"/>
                  Mr. Banks always carried in his pocket;* they were going to a place that was at
                  least seven miles distant from the fort, where the Indians might be less
                  submissive than at home, and to take from them what they had ventured their lives
                  to get; and what, notwithstanding our conjectures, they appeared desirous to keep:
                  these were discouraging circumstances, and their situation would become more
                  critical at every step. They determined, however, not to relinquish their
                  enterprize, nor to pursue it without taking the best measures for their security
                  that were in their power. It was therefore determined, that Mr. Banks and Mr.
                  Green should go on, and that the Midshipman should return to me, and desire that I
                  would send a party of men after them, acquainting me at the same time, that it was
                  impossible they should return till it was dark. Upon receiving this message I set
                  out, with such a party as I thought sufficient for the occasion; leaving orders,
                  both at the ship and at the fort, that no canoe should be suffered to go out of
                  the bay, but that none of the natives should be seized or detained. </p><p n="222">In the mean time, Mr. Banks and Mr. Green pursued their journey, under the
                  auspices of Tubourai Tamaide, and in the very spot which he had specified, they
                  met one of his own people, with part of the quadrant in his hand. At this most
                  welcome sight they stopped; and a great number of Indians immediately came up,
                  some of whom pressing rather rudely upon them, Mr. Banks thought it necessary to
                  shew one of his pistols, the sight of which reduced them instantly to order: as
                  the crowd that gathered round them was every moment increasing, he marked out a
                  circle in the grass, and they ranged themselves on the outside of it to the number
                  of several hundreds with great quietness and decorum. Into the middle of this
                  circle, the box, which was now arrived, was ordered to be brought, with several
                  reading glasses, and <pb n="114"/> other small matters,* which in their hurry they
                  had put into a pistol-case, that Mr. Banks knew to be his property, it having been
                  some time before stolen from the tents, with a horse pistol in it, which he
                  immediately demanded, and which was also restored. </p><p n="223">Mr. Green was impatient to see whether all that had been taken away was
                  returned, and upon examining the box found the stand, and a few small things of
                  less consequence, wanting; several persons were sent in search of these, and most
                  of the small things were returned: but it was signified that the thief had not
                  brought the stand so far, and that it would be delivered to our friends as they
                  went back; this being confirmed by Tubourai Tamaide, they prepared to return, as
                  nothing would then be wanting but what might easily be supplied; and after they
                  had advanced about two miles, I met them with my party, to our mutual
                  satisfaction, congratulating each other upon the recovery of the quadrant, with a
                  pleasure proportioned to the importance of the event. </p><p n="224">About eight o'clock, Mr. Banks with Tubourai Tamaide got back to the fort;
                  when, to his great surprize, he found Tootahah in custody, and many of the natives
                  in the utmost terror and distress, crowding about the gate. He went hastily in,
                  some of the Indians were suffered to follow him, and the scene was extremely
                  affecting. Tubourai Tamaide pressing forward, ran up to Tootahah, and catching him
                  in his arms, they both burst into tears, and wept over each other, without being
                  able to speak: the other Indians were also in tears for their Chief, both he and
                  they being strongly possessed with the notion that he was to be put to death. In
                  this situation they continued till I entered the fort, which was about a quarter
                  of an hour afterwards. I was equally <pb n="115"/> surprized and concerned at what
                  had happened,* the confining Tootahah being contrary to my orders, and therefore
                  instantly set him at liberty. Upon enquiring into the affair, I was told, that my
                  going into the woods with a party of men under arms, at a time when a robbery had
                  been committed, which it was supposed I should resent, in proportion to our
                  apparent injury by the loss, had so alarmed the natives, that in the evening they
                  began to leave the neighbourhood of the fort with their effects: that a double
                  canoe having been seen to put off from the bottom of the bay by Mr. Gore, the
                  Second Lieutenant, who was left in command on board the ship, and who had received
                  orders not to suffer any canoe to go out, he sent the Boatswain with a boat after
                  her to bring her back: that as soon as the boat came up, the Indians, being
                  alarmed, leaped into the sea; and that Tootahah, being unfortunately one of the
                  number, the Boatswain took him up, and brought him to the ship, suffering the rest
                  of the people to swim on shore: that Mr. Gore, not sufficiently attending to the
                  order that none of the people should be confined, had sent him to the fort, and
                  Mr. Hicks, the First Lieutenant, who commanded there, receiving him in charge from
                  Gore, did not think himself at liberty to dismiss him. </p><p n="225">The notion that we intended to put him to death had possessed him so
                  strongly, that he could not be persuaded to the contrary till by my orders he was
                  led out of the fort. The people received him as they would have done a father in
                  the same circumstances, and every one pressed forward to embrace him. Sudden joy
                  is commonly liberal, without a scrupulous regard to merit; and Tootahah, in the
                  first expansion of his heart, upon being unexpectedly restored to liberty and
                  life, insisted upon our receiving a present of two hogs; though, being conscious
                  that upon this occasion we had no claim to favours, we refused them many times. </p><p n="226"><pb n="116"/>*Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander attended the next morning in their usual
                  capacity of market-men, but very few Indians appeared, and those who came brought
                  no provisions. Tootahah, however, sent some of his people for the canoe that had
                  been detained, which they took away. A canoe having also been detained that
                  belonged to Oberea, TUPIA, the person who managed her affairs when the Dolphin was
                  here, was sent to examine whether any thing on board had been taken away: and he
                  was so well satisfied of the contrary, that he left the canoe where he found it,
                  and joined us at the fort, where he spent the day, and slept on board the canoe at
                  night. About noon, some fishing boats came abreast of the tents, but would part
                  with very little of what they had on board; and we felt the want of cocoa-nuts and
                  bread-fruit very severely. In the course of the day, Mr. Banks walked out into the
                  woods, that by conversing with the people he might recover their confidence and
                  good-will: he found them civil, but they all complained of the ill-treatment of
                  their Chief; who, they said, had been beaten and pulled by the hair. Mr. Banks
                  endeavoured to convince them, that he had suffered no personal violence, which to
                  the best of our knowlege was true; yet, perhaps the Boatswain had behaved with a
                  brutality which he was afraid or ashamed to acknowledge. The Chief himself being,
                  probably, upon recollection, of opinion that we had ill-deserved the hogs, which
                  he had left with us as a present, sent a messenger in the afternoon to demand an
                  ax, and a shirt in return; but as I was told that he did not intend to come down
                  to the fort for ten days, I excused myself from giving them till I should see him,
                  hoping that his impatience might induce him to fetch them, and knowing that
                  absence would probably continue the coolness between us, to which the first
                  interview might put an end. </p><p n="227"><pb n="117"/>The next day we were still more sensible of the inconvenience we had
                  incurred by giving offence to the people in the person of their Chief,* for the
                  market was so ill supplied that we were in want of necessaries. Mr. Banks
                  therefore went into the woods to Tubourai Tamaide, and with some difficulty
                  persuaded him to let us have five baskets of breadfruit; a very seasonable supply,
                  as they contained above one hundred and twenty. In the afternoon another messenger
                  arrived from Tootahah for the ax and shirt; as it was now become absolutely
                  necessary to recover the friendship of this man, without which it would be
                  scarcely possible to procure provisions, I sent word that Mr. Banks and myself
                  would visit him on the morrow, and bring what he wanted with us. </p><p n="228">Early the next morning he sent again to remind me of my promise,* and his
                  people seemed to wait till we should set out with great impatience: I therefore
                  ordered the pinnace, in which I embarked with Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander about ten
                  o'clock: we took one of Tootahah's people in the boat with us, and in about an
                  hour we arrived at his place of residence which is called EPARRE, and is about
                  four miles to the westward of the tents. </p><p n="229">We found the people waiting for us in great numbers upon the shore, so
                  that it would have been impossible for us to have proceeded, if way had not been
                  made for us by a tall well-looking man, who had something like a turban about his
                  head, and a long white stick in his hand, with which he laid about him at an
                  unmerciful rate. This man conducted us to the Chief, while the people shouted
                  round us, Taio Tootahah, "Tootahah is your friend." We found him, like an ancient
                  Patriarch, sitting under a tree, with a number of venerable old men standing round
                  him; he made a sign to us to sit down, and immediately asked for his ax: <pb n="118"/> this I presented to him,* with an upper garment of broadcloth, made
                  after the country fashion, and trimmed with tape, to which I also added a shirt:
                  he received them with great satisfaction, and immediately put on the garment; but
                  the shirt he gave to the person who had cleared the way for us upon our landing,
                  who was now seated by us, and of whom he seemed desirous that we should take
                  particular notice. In a short time, Oberea, and several other women whom we knew,
                  came and sat down among us: Tootahah left us several times, but after a short
                  absence returned; we thought it had been to show himself in his new finery to the
                  people, but we wronged him, for it was to give directions for our refreshment and
                  entertainment. While we were waiting for his return the last time he left us, very
                  impatient to be dismissed, as we were almost suffocated in the croud, word was
                  brought us, that he expected us elsewhere: we found him sitting under the awning
                  of our own boat, and making signs that we should come to him: as many of us
                  therefore went on board as the boat would hold, and he then ordered bread-fruit
                  and cocoa-nuts to be brought, of both which we tasted, rather to gratify him than
                  because we had a desire to eat. A message was soon after brought him, upon which
                  he went out of the boat, and we were in a short time desired to follow. We were
                  conducted to a large area or court-yard, which was railed round with bamboos about
                  three feet high, on one side of his house, where an entertainment was provided for
                  us, entirely new: this was a wrestling match. At the upper end of the area sat the
                  Chief, and several of his principal men were ranged on each side of him, so as to
                  form a semicircle; these were the judges, by whom the victor was to be applauded;
                  seats were also left for us at each end of the line, but we chose rather to be at
                  liberty among the rest of the spectators. </p><p n="230"><pb n="119"/>When all was ready, ten or twelve persons,* whom we understood to be
                  the combatants, and who were naked, except a cloth that was fastened about the
                  waist, entered the area, and walked slowly round it, in a stooping posture, with
                  their left hands on their right breasts, and their right hands open, with which
                  they frequently struck the left fore-arm so as to produce a quick smart sound:
                  this was a general challenge to the combatants whom they were to engage, or any
                  other person present: after these followed others in the same manner, and then a
                  particular challenge was given, by which each man singled out his antagonist: this
                  was done by joining the finger ends of both hands, and bringing them to the
                  breast, at the same time moving the elbows up and down with a quick motion: if the
                  person to whom this was addressed accepted the challenge, he repeated the signs,
                  and immediately each put himself into an attitude to engage: the next minute they
                  closed; but, except in first seizing each other, it was a mere contest of
                  strength: each endeavoured to lay hold of the other, first by the thigh, and if
                  that failed by the hand, the hair, the cloth, or elsewhere as he could: when this
                  was done they grappled, without the least dexterity or skill, till one of them, by
                  having a more advantageous hold, or greater muscular force, threw the other on his
                  back. When the contest was over, the old men gave their plaudit to the victor in a
                  few words, which they repeated together in a kind of tune: his conquest was also
                  generally celebrated by three huzzas. The entertainment was then suspended for a
                  few minutes, after which another couple of wrestlers came forward and engaged in
                  the same manner: if it happened that neither was thrown, after the contest had
                  continued about a minute, they parted, either by consent or the intervention of
                  their friends, and in this case each slapped his arm, as a challenge to a new
                  engagement, either with <pb n="120"/> the same antagonist or some other.* While
                  the wrestlers were engaged, another party of men performed a dance which lasted
                  also about a minute; but neither of these parties took the least notice of each
                  other, their attention being wholly fixed on what they were doing. We observed
                  with pleasure, that the conqueror never exulted over the vanquished, and that the
                  vanquished never repined at the success of the conqueror; the whole contest was
                  carried on with perfect good-will and good-humour, though in the presence of at
                  least five hundred spectators, of whom some were women. The number of women indeed
                  was comparatively small, none but those of rank were present, and we had reason to
                  believe that they would not have been spectators of this exercise but in
                  compliment to us. </p><p n="231">This lasted about two hours; during all which time the man who had made
                  way for us when we landed, kept the people at a proper distance, by striking those
                  who pressed forward very severely with his stick: upon enquiry we learnt, that he
                  was an officer belonging to Tootahah, acting as a master of the ceremonies. </p><p n="232">It is scarcely possible for those who are acquainted with the athletic
                  sports of very remote antiquity, not to remark a rude resemblance of them in this
                  wrestling-match among the natives of a little island in the midst of the Pacific
                  Ocean: and even our female readers may recollect the account given of them by
                  Fenelon in his Telemachus, where, though the events are fictitious, the manners of
                  the age are faithfully transcribed from authors by whom they are supposed to have
                  been truly related. </p><p n="233">When the wrestling was over, we were given to understand that two hogs,
                  and a large quantity of bread-fruit were preparing for our dinner, which, as our
                  appetites were now <pb n="121"/> keen, was very agreeable intelligence. Our host,
                  however,* seemed to repent of his liberality; for, instead of setting his two hogs
                  before us, he ordered one of them to be carried into our boat; at first we were
                  not sorry for this new disposition of matters, thinking that we should dine more
                  comfortably in the boat than on shore, as the croud would more easily be kept at a
                  distance: but when we came on board, he ordered us to proceed with his hog to the
                  ship; this was mortifying, as we were now to row four miles while our dinner was
                  growing cold; however, we thought fit to comply, and were at last gratified with
                  the cheer that he had provided, of which he and Tubourai Tamaide had a liberal
                  share. </p><p n="234">Our reconciliation with this man operated upon the people like a charm;
                  for he was no sooner known to be on board, than bread-fruit, cocoa-nuts, and other
                  provisions were brought to the fort in great plenty. </p><p n="235">Affairs now went on in the usual channel; but pork being still a scarce
                  commodity, our Master, Mr. Mollineux, and Mr. Green went in the pinnace to the
                  eastward, on the <date>8th</date>,* early in the morning, to see whether they could procure any
                  hogs or poultry in that part of the country: they proceeded in that direction
                  twenty miles; but though they saw many hogs, and one turtle, they could not
                  purchase either at any price: the people everywhere told them, that they all
                  belonged to Tootahah, and that they could fell none of them without his
                  permission. We now began to think that this man was indeed a great Prince; for an
                  influence so extensive and absolute could be acquired by no other. And we
                  afterwards found that he administered the government of this part of the island,
                  as sovereign, for a minor whom we never saw all the time that we were upon it.
                  When Mr. <pb n="122"/> Green returned from this expedition,* he said he had seen a
                  tree of a size which he was afraid to relate, it being no less than sixty yards in
                  circumference; but Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander soon explained to him, that it was a
                  species of the fig, the branches of which, bending down, take fresh root in the
                  earth, and thus form a congeries of trunks, which being very close to each other,
                  and all joined by a common vegetation, might easily be mistaken for one. </p><p n="236">Though the market at the fort was now tolerably supplied, provisions were
                  brought more slowly: a sufficient quantity used to be purchased between sun-rise
                  and eight o'clock, but it was now become necessary to attend the greatest part of
                  the day. Mr. Banks, therefore, fixed his little boat up before the door of the
                  fort, which was of great use as a place to trade in: hitherto we had purchased
                  cocoa-nuts and bread-fruit for beads; but the market becoming rather slack in
                  these articles, we were now, for the first time, forced to bring out our nails:
                  one of our smallest size, which was about four inches long, procured us twenty
                  cocoa-nuts, and bread-fruit in proportion, so that in a short time our first
                  plenty was restored. </p><p n="237">*On the <date>9th</date>, soon after breakfast, we received a visit from Oberea, being
                  the first that she had made us after the loss of our quadrant, and the unfortunate
                  confinement of Tootahah; with her came her present favourite, Obadée, and Tupia:
                  they brought us a hog and some bread-fruit, in return for which we gave her a
                  hatchet. We had now afforded our Indian friends a new and interesting object of
                  curiosity, our forge, which having been set up some time, was almost constantly at
                  work. It was now common for them to bring pieces of iron, which we supposed they
                  must have got from the Dolphin, to be made into tools of various kinds; and as <pb n="123"/> I was very desirous to gratify them, they were indulged,* except when
                  the smith's time was too precious to be spared. Oberea having received her
                  hatchet, produced as much old iron as would have made another, with a request that
                  another might be made of it: in this, however, I could not gratify her, upon which
                  she brought out a broken ax, and desired it might be mended; I was glad of an
                  opportunity to compromise the difference between us: her ax was mended, and she
                  appeared to be content. They went away at night, and took with them the canoe,
                  which had been a considerable time at the point, but promised to return in three
                  days. </p><p n="238">On the <date>10th</date>,* I put some seeds of melons and other plants into a spot of
                  ground which had been turned up for the purpose; they had all been sealed up by
                  the person of whom they were bought, in small bottles with rosin; but none of them
                  came up except mustard; even the cucumbers and melons failed, and Mr. Banks is of
                  opinion that they were spoiled by the total exclusion of fresh air. </p><p n="239">This day we learnt the Indian name of the island, which is OTAHEITE, and
                  by that name I shall hereafter distinguish it: but after great pains taken we
                  found it utterly impossible to teach the Indians to pronounce our names; we had,
                  therefore, new names, consisting of such sounds as they produced in the attempt.
                  They called me Toote; Mr. Hicks, Hete; Molineux they renounced in absolute
                  despair, and called the Master Boba, from his Christian name Robert; Mr. Gore was
                  Toarro; Dr. Solander, Torano; and Mr. Banks, Tapane; Mr. Green, Eteree; Mr.
                  Parkinson, Patini; Mr. Sporing, Polini; Petersgill, Petrodero; and in this manner
                  they had now formed names for almost every man in the ship: in some, however, it
                  was not easy to find any traces of the original, <pb n="124"/> and they were
                  perhaps not mere arbitrary sounds formed upon the occasion,* but significant words
                  in their own language. Monkhouse, the Midshipman, who commanded the party that
                  killed the man for stealing the musket, they called Matte; not merely by an
                  attempt to imitate in sound the first syllable of Monkhouse, but because Matte
                  signifies dead; and this probably might be the case with others. </p></div><div type="chapter" n="12"><head><l>CHAP.XII.</l><l><emph rend="italic"> Some Ladies visit the Fort with very uncommon Ceremonies:
                        The Indians attend Divine Service, and in the Evening exhibit a most
                        extraordinary Spectacle: Tubourai Tamaide falls into Temptation.</emph></l></head><p n="240">*FRIDAY, the <date>12th of May</date>, was distinguished by a visit from some ladies
                  whom we had never seen before, and who introduced themselves with some very
                  singular ceremonies. Mr. Banks was trading in his boat at the gate of the fort as
                  usual, in company with Tootahah, who had that morning paid him a visit, and some
                  other of the natives; between nine and ten o'clock, a double canoe came to the
                  landing-place, under the awning of which sat a man and two women: the Indians that
                  were about him made signs that he should go out to meet them, which he hasted to
                  do; but by the time he could get out of the boat, they had advanced within ten
                  yards of him: they then stopped, and made signs that he should do so too, laying
                  down about a dozen young plantain trees, and some other small plants: he complied,
                  and the people having made a lane between <pb n="125"/> them, the man, who
                  appeared to be a servant,* brought them to Mr. Banks by one of each at a time,
                  passing and repassing six times, and always pronouncing a short sentence when he
                  delivered them. Tupia, who stood by Mr. Banks, acted as his master of the
                  ceremonies, and receiving the branches as they were brought, laid them down in the
                  boat. When this was done, another man brought a large bundle of cloth, which
                  having opened, he spread piece by piece upon the ground, in the space between Mr.
                  Banks and has visitors; there were nine pieces, and having laid three pieces one
                  upon another, the foremost of the women, who seemed to be the principal, and who
                  was called OORATTOOA, stepped upon them, and taking up her garments all round her
                  to the waist, turned about, with great composure and deliberation, and with an air
                  of perfect innocence and simplicity, three times; when this was done, she dropped
                  the veil, and stepping off the cloth, three more pieces were laid on, and she
                  repeated the ceremony, then stepping off as before; the last three were laid on,
                  and the ceremony was repeated in the same manner the third time. Immediately after
                  this the cloth was rolled up, and given to Mr. Banks, as a present from the lady,
                  who, with her friend, came up and saluted him. He made such presents to them both
                  as he thought would be most acceptable, and after having staid about an hour they
                  went away. In the evening, the Gentlemen at the fort had a visit from Oberea, and
                  her favourite female attendant, whose name was OTHEOTHEA, an agreeable girl, whom
                  they were the more pleased to see, because, having been some days absent, it had
                  been reported that she was either sick or dead. </p><p n="241">On the <date>13th</date>, the market being over about ten o'clock,* Mr. Banks walked
                  into the woods with his gun, as he generally did, for the benefit of the shade in
                  the heat of the day: as he <pb n="126"/> was returning back,* he met Tubourai
                  Tamaide, near his occasional dwelling, and stopping to spend a little time with
                  him, he suddenly took the gun out of Mr. Banks's hand, cocked it, and, holding it
                  up in the air, drew the trigger: fortunately for him, it flashed in the pan: Mr.
                  Banks immediately took it from him, not a little surprised how he had acquired
                  sufficient knowlege of a gun to discharge it, and reproved him with great severity
                  for what he had done. As it was of infinite importance to keep the Indians totally
                  ignorant of the management of fire-arms, he had taken every opportunity of
                  intimating that they could never offend him so highly as by even touching his
                  piece; it was now proper to enforce this prohibition, and he therefore added
                  threats to his reproof: the Indian bore all patiently; but the moment Mr. Banks
                  crossed the river, he set off with all his family and furniture for his house at
                  Eparre. This being quickly known from the Indians at the fort, and great
                  inconvenience being apprehended from the displeasure of this man, who upon all
                  occasions had been particularly useful, Mr. Banks determined to follow him without
                  delay, and solicit his return: he set out the same evening, accompanied by Mr.
                  Mollineux, and found him sitting in the middle of a large circle of people, to
                  whom he had probably related what had happened, and his fears of the consequences;
                  he was himself the very picture of grief and dejection, and the same passions were
                  strongly marked in the countenances of all the people that surrounded him. When
                  Mr. Banks and Mr. Mollineux went into the circle, one of the women expressed her
                  trouble, as Terapo had done upon another occasion, and struck a shark's tooth into
                  her head several times, till it was covered with blood. Mr. Banks lost no time in
                  putting an end to this universal distress; he assured the Chief, that every thing
                  which had passed should be forgotten, that there was not <pb n="127"/> the least
                  animosity remaining on one side,* nor any thing to be feared on the other. The
                  Chief was soon soothed into confidence and complacency, a double canoe was ordered
                  to be got ready, they all returned together to the fort before supper, and as a
                  pledge of perfect reconciliation, both he and his wife slept all night in Mr.
                  Banks's tent: their presence, however, was no palladium; for, between eleven and
                  twelve o'clock, one of the natives attempted to get into the fort by scaling the
                  walls, with a design, no doubt, to steal whatever he should happen to find; he was
                  discovered by the centinel, who happily did not fire, and he ran away much faster
                  than any of our people could follow him. The iron, and iron-tools, which were in
                  continual use at the armourer's forge, that was set up within the works, were
                  temptations to theft which none of these people could withstand. </p><p n="242">On the <date>14th</date>, which was Sunday,* I directed that Divine Service should be
                  performed at the fort: we were desirous that some of the principal Indians should
                  be present, but when the hour came, most of them were returned home. Mr. Banks,
                  however, crossed the river, and brought back Tubourai Tamaide and his wife Tomio,
                  hoping that it would give occasion to some enquiries on their part, and some
                  instruction on ours: having seated them, he placed himself between them, and
                  during the whole service, they very attentively observed his behaviour, and very
                  exactly imitated it; standing, sitting, or kneeling, as they saw him do: they were
                  conscious that we were employed about somewhat serious and important, as appeared
                  by their calling to the Indians without the fort to be silent; yet when the
                  service was over, neither of them asked any questions, nor would they attend to
                  any attempt that was made to explain what had been done. </p><p n="243"><pb n="128"/>*Such were our Matins; our Indians thought fit to perform Vespers of
                  a very different kind. A young man, near six feet high, performed the rites of
                  Venus with a little girl about eleven or twelve years of age, before several of
                  our people, and a great number of the natives, without the least sense of its
                  being indecent or improper, but, as appeared, in perfect conformity to the custom
                  of the place. Among the spectators were several women of superior rank,
                  particularly Oberea, who may properly be said to have assisted at the ceremony;
                  for they gave instructions to the girl how to perform her part, which, young as
                  she was, she did not seem much to stand in need of. </p><p n="244">This incident is not mentioned as an object of idle curiosity, but as it
                  deserves consideration in determining a question which has been long debated in
                  philosophy; Whether the shame attending certain actions, which are allowed on all
                  sides to be in themselves innocent, is implanted in Nature, or superinduced by
                  custom? If it has its origin in custom, it will, perhaps, be found difficult to
                  trace that custom, however general, to its source; if in instinct, it will be
                  equally difficult to discover from what cause it is subdued or at least over-ruled
                  among these people, in whose manners not the least trace of it is to be found. </p><p n="245">*On the <date>14th</date> and <date>15th</date>, we had another opportunity of observing the general
                  knowlege which these people had of any design that was formed among them. In the
                  night between the <date>13th</date> and <date>14th</date>, one of the water-casks was stolen from the
                  outside of the fort: in the morning, there was not an Indian to be seen who did
                  not know that it was gone; yet they appeared not to have been trusted, or not to
                  have been worthy of trust; for they seemed all of them disposed to give
                  intelligence where it might be found. Mr. Banks <pb n="129"/> traced it to a part
                  of the bay where he was told it had been put into a canoe,* but as it was not of
                  great consequence he did not complete the discovery. When he returned, he was told
                  by Tubourai Tamaide, that another cask would be stolen before the morning: how he
                  came by this knowlege it is not easy to imagine; that he was not a party in the
                  design is certain, for he came with his wife and his family to the place where the
                  water casks stood, and placing their beds near them, he said he would himself be a
                  pledge for their safety, in despight of the thief: of this, however, we would not
                  admit; and making him understand that a sentry would be placed to watch the casks
                  till the morning, he removed the beds into Mr. Banks's tent, where he and his
                  family spent the night, making signs to the sentry when he retired, that he should
                  keep his eyes open. In the night this intelligence appeared to be true; about
                  twelve o'clock the thief came, but discovering that a watch had been set, he went
                  away without his booty. </p><p n="246">Mr. Banks's confidence in Tubourai Tamaide had greatly increased since the
                  affair of the knife, in consequence of which he was at length exposed to
                  temptations which neither his integrity nor his honour was able to resist. They
                  had withstood many allurements, but were at length ensnared by the fascinating
                  charms of a basket of nails; these nails were much larger than any that had yet
                  been brought into trade, and had, with perhaps some degree of criminal negligence,
                  been left in a corner of Mr. Banks's tent, to which the Chief had always free
                  access. One of these nails Mr. Banks's servant happened to see in his possession,
                  upon his having inadvertently thrown back that part of his garment under which it
                  was concealed. Mr. Banks being told of this, and knowing that no such thing had
                  been given <pb n="130"/> him,* either as a present or in barter, immediately
                  examined the basket, and discovered, that out of seven nails five were missing. He
                  then, though not without great reluctance, charged him with the fact, which he
                  immediately confessed, and however he might suffer, was probably not more hurt
                  than his accuser. A demand was immediately made of restitution; but this he
                  declined, saying, that the nails were at Eparre: however, Mr. Banks appearing to
                  be much in earnest, and using some threatening signs, he thought fit to produce
                  one of them. He was then taken to the fort, to receive such judgment as should be
                  given against him by the general voice. </p><p n="247">After some deliberation, that we might not appear to think too lightly of
                  his offence, he was told, that if he would bring the other four nails to the fort,
                  it should be forgotten. To this condition he agreed; but I am sorry to say he did
                  not fulfil it. Instead of fetching the nails, he removed with his family before
                  night, and took all his furniture with him. </p><p n="248">As our long-boat had appeared to be leaky, I thought it necessary to
                  examine her bottom, and, to my great surprize, found it so much eaten by the
                  worms, that it was necessary to give her a new one; no such accident had happened
                  to the Dolphin's boats, as I was informed by the officers on board, and therefore
                  it was a misfortune that I did not expect: I feared that the pinnace also might be
                  nearly in the same condition; but, upon examining her, I had the satisfaction to
                  find that not a worm had touched her, though she was built of the same wood, and
                  had been as much in the water; the reason of this difference I imagine to be, that
                  the long-boat was paid with varnish of pine, and the pinnace painted with white
                  lead and oil; the bottoms of all boats therefore which are sent into this country
                  should be painted <pb n="131"/> like that of the pinnace,* and the ships should be
                  supplied with a good stock, in order to give them a new coating when it shall be
                  found necessary. </p><p n="249">Having received repeated messages from Tootahah,* that if we would pay him
                  a visit he would acknowledge the favour by a present of four hogs, I sent Mr.
                  Hicks, my First Lieutenant, to try if he could not procure the hogs upon easier
                  terms, with orders to show him every civility in his power. Mr. Hicks found that
                  he was removed from Eparre to a place called TETTAHAH, five miles farther to the
                  westward. He was received with great cordiality; one hog was immediately produced,
                  and he was told that the other three, which were at some distance, should be
                  brought in the morning. Mr. Hicks readily consented to stay; but the morning came
                  without the hogs, and it not being convenient to stay longer, he returned in the
                  evening, with the one that he had got. </p><p n="250">On the <date>25th</date>,* Tubourai Tamaide and his wife Tomio made their appearance at
                  the tent, for the first time since he had been detected in stealing the nails; he
                  seemed to be under some discontent and apprehension, yet he did not think fit to
                  purchase our countenance and good-will by restoring the four which he had sent
                  away. As Mr. Banks and the other Gentlemen treated him with a coolness and reserve
                  which did not at all tend to restore his peace or good-humour, his stay was short,
                  and his departure abrupt. Mr. Monkhouse, the Surgeon, went the next morning in
                  order to effect a reconciliation, by persuading him to bring down the nails, but
                  he could not succeed. </p></div><pb n="132"/><div type="chapter" n="13"><head><l>CHAP.XIII.</l><l><emph rend="italic"> Another Visit to Tootahah, with various Adventures:

                  though we were not very confident that we should receive the hogs for our pains. I
                  therefore set out early in the morning, with Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, and three
                  others, in the pinnace. He was now removed from Tettahah, where Mr. Hicks had seen
                  him, to a place called ATAHOUROU, about six miles farther, and as we could not go
                  above half way thither in the boat, it was almost evening before we arrived: we
                  found him in his usual state, sitting under a tree, with a great crowd about him.
                  We made our presents in due form, consisting of a yellow stuff petticoat, and some
                  other trifling articles, which were graciously received; a hog was immediately
                  ordered to be killed and dressed for supper, with a promise of more in the
                  morning: however, as we were less desirous of feasting upon our journey than of
                  carrying back with us provisions, which would be more welcome at the fort, we
                  procured a reprieve for the hog, and supped upon the fruits of the country. As
                  night now came on, and the place was crowded with many more than the houses and
                  canoes would contain; there being Oberea with her attendants, and many other
                  travellers whom we knew, we began to look out for lodgings. Our party <pb n="133"/> consisted of six:* Mr. Banks thought himself fortunate in being offered a place
                  by Oberea in her canoe, and wishing his friends a good night, took his leave. He
                  went to rest early, according to the custom of the country, and taking off his
                  clothes, as was his constant practice, the nights being hot, Oberea kindly
                  insisted upon taking them into her own custody, for otherwise she said they would
                  certainly be stolen. Mr. Banks having such a safeguard, resigned himself to sleep
                  with all imaginable tranquillity: but awaking about eleven o'clock, and wanting to
                  get up, he searched for his clothes where he had seen them deposited by Oberea
                  when he lay down to sleep, and soon perceived that they were missing. He
                  immediately awakened Oberea, who starting up, and hearing his complaint, ordered
                  lights, and prepared in great haste to recover what he had lost: Tootahah himself
                  slept in the next canoe, and being soon alarmed, he came to them and set out with
                  Oberea in search of the thief: Mr. Banks was not in a condition to go with them,
                  for of his apparel scarce any thing was left him but his breeches; his coat, and
                  his waistcoat, with his pistols, powder-horn, and many other things that were in
                  the pockets, were gone. In about half an hour his two noble friends returned, but
                  without having obtained any intelligence of his clothes or of the thief. At first
                  he began to be alarmed, his musquet had not indeed been taken away, but he had
                  neglected to load it; where I and Dr. Solander had disposed of ourselves he did
                  not know; and therefore, whatever might happen, he could not have recourse to us
                  for assistance. He thought it best, however, to express neither fear nor suspicion
                  of those about him, and giving his musquet to Tupia, who had been waked in the
                  confusion and stood by him, with a charge not to suffer it to be stolen, he betook
                  himself again to rest, declaring himself perfectly satisfied with the pains that
                  Tootahah and Oberea <pb n="134"/> had taken to recover his things,* though they
                  had not been successful. As it cannot be supposed that in such a situation his
                  sleep was very sound, he soon after heard music, and saw lights at a little
                  distance on shore: this was a concert or assembly, which they call a HEIVA, a
                  common name for every public exhibition; and as it would necessarily bring many
                  people together, and there was a chance of my being among them with his other
                  friends, he rose, and made the best of his way towards it: he was soon led by the
                  lights and the sound to the hut where I lay, with three other Gentlemen of our
                  party; and easily distinguishing us from the rest, he made up to us more than half
                  naked, and told us his melancholy story. We gave him such comfort as the
                  unfortunate generally give to each other, by telling him that we were
                  fellow-sufferers; I showed him that I was myself without stockings, they having
                  been stolen from under my head, though I was sure I had never been asleep, and
                  each of my associates convinced him, by his appearance, that he had lost a jacket.
                  We determined, however, to hear out the concert, however deficient we might appear
                  in our dress; it consisted of three drums, four flutes, and several voices: when
                  this entertainment, which lasted about an hour, was over, we retired again to our
                  sleeping-places; having agreed, that nothing could be done toward the recovery of
                  our things till the morning. </p><p n="252">*We rose at day-break, according to the custom of the country; the first
                  man that Mr. Banks saw was Tupia, faithfully attending with his musquet; and soon
                  after, Oberea brought him some of her country clothes, as a succedaneum for his
                  own, so that when he came to us he made a most motley appearance, half Indian and
                  half English. Our party soon got together, except Dr. Solander, whose quarters we
                  did not know, and who had not assisted at the concert: in a <pb n="135"/> short
                  time Tootahah made his appearance,* and we pressed him to recover our clothes; but
                  neither he nor Oberea could be persuaded to take any measure for that purpose, so
                  that we began to suspect that they had been parties in the theft. About eight
                  o'clock, we were joined by Dr. Solander, who had fallen into honester hands, at a
                  house about a mile distant, and had lost nothing. </p><p n="253">Having given up all hope of recovering our clothes, which indeed were
                  never afterwards heard of, we spent all the morning in soliciting the hogs which
                  we had been promised; but in this we had no better success: we therefore, in no
                  very good humour, set out for the boat about twelve o'clock, with only that which
                  we had redeemed from the butcher and the cook the night before. </p><p n="254">As we were returning to the boat, however, we were entertained with a
                  sight that in some measure compensated for our fatigue and disappointment. In our
                  way we came to one of the few places where access to the island is not guarded by
                  a reef, and, consequently, a high surf breaks upon the shore; a more dreadful one
                  indeed I had seldom seen; it was impossible for any European boat to have lived in
                  it; and if the best swimmer in Europe had, by any accident, been exposed to its
                  fury, I am confident that he would not have been able to preserve himself from
                  drowning, especially as the shore was covered with pebbles and large stones; yet,
                  in the midst of these breakers, were ten or twelve Indians swimming for their
                  amusement: whenever a surf broke near them, they dived under it, and, to all
                  appearance with infinite facility, rose again on the other side. This diversion
                  was greatly improved by the stern of an old canoe, which they happened to find
                  upon the spot; they took this before them, and swam out with it as far as the
                  outermost breach, then two or three <pb n="136"/> of them getting into it,* and
                  turning the square end to the breaking wave, were driven in towards the shore with
                  incredible rapidity, sometimes almost to the beach; but generally the wave broke
                  over them before they got half way, in which case they dived, and rose on the
                  other side with the canoe in their hands: they then swam out with it again, and
                  were again driven back, just as our holiday youth climb the hill in Greenwich park
                  for the pleasure of rolling down it. At this wonderful scene we stood gazing for
                  more than half an hour, during which time none of the swimmers attempted to come
                  on shore, but seemed to enjoy their sport in the highest degree; we then proceeded
                  in our journey, and late in the evening got back to the fort. </p><p n="255">Upon this occasion it may be observed, that human nature is endued with
                  powers which are only accidentally exerted to the utmost; and that all men are
                  capable of what no man attains, except he is stimulated to the effort by some
                  uncommon circumstances or situation. These Indians effected what to us appeared to
                  be supernatural, merely by the application of such powers as they possessed in
                  common with us, and all other men who have no particular infirmity or defect. The
                  truth of the observation is also manifest from more familiar instances. The
                  rope-dancer and balance-master owe their art, not to any peculiar liberality of
                  Nature, but to an accidental improvement of her common gifts; and though equal
                  diligence and application would not always produce equal excellence in these, any
                  more than in other arts; yet there is no doubt but that a certain degree of
                  proficiency in them might be universally attained. Another proof of the existence
                  of abilities in mankind, that are almost universally dormant, is furnished by the
                  attainments of blind men. It cannot be supposed that the loss of one sense, like
                  the amputation <pb n="137"/> of a branch from a tree,* gives new vigour to those
                  that remain. Every man's hearing and touch, therefore, are capable of the nice
                  distinctions which astonish us in those that have lost their sight, and if they do
                  not give the same intelligence to the mind, it is merely because the same
                  intelligence is not required of them: he that can see may do from choice what the
                  blind do by necessity, and by the same diligent attention to the other senses, may
                  receive the same notices from them; let it therefore be remembered as an
                  encouragement to persevering diligence, and a principle of general use to mankind,
                  that he who does all he can, will ever effect much more than is generally thought
                  to be possible. </p><p n="256">Among other Indians that had visited us, there were some from a
                  neighbouring island which they called EIMEO or IMAO, the same to which Captain
                  Wallis had given the name of the Duke of York's island, and they gave us an
                  account of no less than two and twenty islands that lay in the neighbourhood of
                  Otaheite. </p><p n="257">As the day of observation now approached, I determined, in consequence of
                  some hints which had been given me by Lord Morton, to send out two parties to
                  observe the transit from other situations; hoping, that if we should fail at
                  Otaheite, they might have better success. We were, therefore, now busily employed
                  in preparing our instruments, and instructing such Gentlemen in the use of them as
                  I intended to send out. </p><p n="258">On Thursday the <date>1st of June</date>,* the Saturday following being the day of the
                  Transit, I dispatched Mr. Gore in the long-boat to Imao, with Mr. Monkhouse and
                  Mr. Sporing, a Gentleman belonging to Mr. Banks, Mr. Green having furnished them
                  with proper instruments. Mr. Banks himself thought <pb n="138"/> fit to go upon
                  this expedition,* and several natives, particularly Tubourai Tamaide and Tomio,
                  were also of the party. Very early on the Friday morning, I sent Mr. Hicks, with
                  Mr. Clerk and Mr. Petersgill, the Master's Mates, and Mr. Saunders, one of the
                  Midshipmen, in the pinnace to the eastward, with orders to six on some convenient
                  spot, at a distance from our principal observatory, where they also might employ
                  the instruments with which they had been furnished for the same purpose. </p><p n="259">The long-boat not having been got ready till Thursday in the afternoon,
                  though all possible expedition was used to fit her out; the people on board, after
                  having rowed most part of the night, brought her to a grappling just under the
                  land of Imao.* Soon after day-break, they saw an Indian canoe, which they hailed,
                  and the people on board shewed them an inlet through the reef into which they
                  pulled, and soon fixed upon a coral rock, which rose out of the water about one
                  hundred and fifty yards from the shore, as a proper situation for their
                  observatory: it was about eighty yards long and twenty broad, and in the middle of
                  it was a bed of white sand, large enough for the tents to stand upon. Mr. Gore and
                  his assistants immediately began to set them up, and make other necessary
                  preparations for the important business of the next day. While this was doing, Mr.
                  Banks, with the Indians of Otaheite, and the people whom they had met in the
                  canoe, went ashore upon the main island, to buy provisions; of which he procured a
                  sufficient supply before night. When he returned to the rock he found the
                  observatory in order, and the telescopes all fixed and tried. The evening was very
                  fine, yet their solicitude did not permit them to take much rest in the night: one
                  or other of them was up every half hour, who satisfied the impatience of the rest
                  by reporting <pb n="139"/> the changes of the sky;* now encouraging their hope by
                  telling them that it was clear, and now alarming their fears by an account that it
                  was hazey. </p><p n="260">At day-break they got up,* and had the satisfaction to see the sun rise,
                  without a cloud. Mr. Banks then, wishing the observers, Mr. Gore and Mr.
                  Monkhouse, success, repaired again to the island, that he might examine its
                  produce, and get a fresh supply of provisions: he began by trading with the
                  natives, for which purpose he took his station under a tree; and to keep them from
                  pressing upon him in a crowd, he drew a circle round him, which he suffered none
                  of them to enter. </p><p n="261">About eight o'clock, he saw two canoes coming towards the place, and was
                  given to understand by the people about him, that they belonged to TARRAO, the
                  King of the island, who was coming to make him a visit. As soon as the canoes came
                  near the shore, the people made a lane from the beach to the trading-place, and
                  his Majesty landed, with his sister, whose name was NUNA; as they advanced towards
                  the tree where Mr. Banks stood, he went out to meet them, and, with great
                  formality, introduced them into the circle from which the other natives had been
                  excluded. As it is the custom of these people to sit during all their conferences,
                  Mr. Banks unwrapped a kind of Turban of Indian cloth, which he wore upon his head
                  instead of a hat, and spreading it upon the ground, they all sat down upon it
                  together. The royal present was then brought, which consisted of a hog and a dog,
                  some bread-fruit, cocoa-nuts, and other articles of the like kind. Mr. Banks then
                  dispatched a canoe to the observatory for his present, and the messengers soon
                  returned with an adze, a shirt, and some beads, which were presented to his
                  Majesty, and received with great satisfaction. </p><p n="262"><pb n="140"/>*By this time, Tubourai Tamaide and Tomio joined them, from the
                  observatory. Tomio said, that she was related to Tarrao, and brought him a present
                  of a long nail, at the same time complimenting Nuna with a shirt. </p><p n="263">The first internal contact of the planet with the sun being over, Mr.
                  Banks returned to the observatory, taking Tarrao, Nuna, and some of their
                  principal attendants, among whom were three very handsome young women, with him:
                  he showed them the planet upon the sun, and endeavoured to make them understand
                  that he and his companions had come from their own country on purpose to see it.
                  Soon after, Mr. Banks returned with them to the island, where he spent the rest of
                  the day in examining its produce, which he found to be much the same with that of
                  Otaheite. The people whom he saw there also exactly resembled the inhabitants of
                  that island, and many of them were persons whom he had seen upon it; so that all
                  those whom he had dealt with, knew of what his trading articles consisted, and the
                  value they bore. </p><p n="264">*The next morning, having struck the tents, they set out on their return,
                  and arrived at the fort before night. </p><p n="265">The observation was made with equal success by the persons whom I had sent
                  to the eastward, and at the fort, there not being a cloud in the sky from the
                  rising to the setting of the sun, the whole passage of the planet Venus over the
                  sun's disk was observed with great advantage by Mr. Green, Dr. Solander, and
                  myself: Mr. Green's telescope and mine were of the same magnifying power, but that
                  of Dr. Solander was greater. We all saw an atmotsphere or dusky cloud round the
                  body of the planet, which very much disturbed the times of contact, especially of
                  the internal ones; and we differed from each other in our accounts of the times of
                  the <pb n="141"/> contacts much more than might have been expected.* According to
                  Mr. Green, </p><p n="266"> Hours. Min. Sec. The first external contact, or first appearance of Venus
                  on the Sun, was 9 25 42 Morning. The first internal contact, or total immersion,
                  was 9 44 4 The second internal contact, or beginning of the emersion, 3 14 8
                  Afternoon. The second external contact, or total emersion 3 32 10 The latitude of
                  the observatory was found to be <geo select="lat" n="24">17° 29′ 15″</geo>; and the longitude
                  <geo select="lon" n="24">149° 32′ 30″ W.</geo> of Greenwich. A more particular account will appear
                  by the tables, for which the reader is referred to the Transactions of the Royal
                  Society, vol. lxi. part 2. page 397 &amp; seq. where they are illustrated by a
                  cut. But if we had reason to congratulate ourselves upon the success of our
                  observation, we had scarce less cause to regret the diligence with which that time
                  had been improved by some of our people to another purpose. While the attention of
                  the officers was engrossed by the Transit of Venus, some of the ship's company
                  broke into one of the store-rooms, and stole a quantity of spike nails, amounting
                  to no less than one hundred weight: this was a matter of public and serious
                  concern; for these nails, if circulated by the people among the Indians, would do
                  us irreparable injury, by reducing the value of iron, our staple commodity. One of
                  the thieves was detected, but only seven nails were found in his custody. He was
                  punished with two dozen lashes, but would impeach none of his accomplices. </p></div><pb n="142"/><div type="chapter" n="14"><head><l>CHAP.XIV.</l><l><emph rend="italic"> The Ceremonies of an Indian Funeral particularly

                  were unwilling to celebrate it during the absence of the two parties who had been
                  sent out to observe the Transit. We had several of the Indian Chiefs at our
                  entertainment, who drank his Majesty's health by the name of Kihiargo, which was
                  the nearest imitation they could produce of King George. </p><p n="268">About this time died an old woman of some rank, who was related to Tomio,
                  which gave us an opportunity to see how they disposed of the body, and confirmed
                  us in our opinion that these people, contrary to the present custom of all other
                  nations now known, never bury their dead. In the middle of a small square, neatly
                  railed in with bamboo, the awning of a canoe was raised upon two posts, and under
                  this the body was deposited upon such a frame as has before been described: it was
                  covered with fine cloth, and near it was placed bread-fruit, fish, and other
                  provisions: we supposed that the food was placed there for the spirit of the
                  deceased, and consequently, that these Indians had some confused notion of a
                  separate state; but upon our applying for <pb n="143"/> further information to
                  Tubourai Tamaide, he told us,* that the food was placed there as an offering to
                  their gods. They do not, however, suppose, that the gods eat, any more than the
                  Jews supposed that Jehovah could dwell in a house: the offering is made here upon
                  the same principle as the Temple was built at Jerusalem, as an expression of
                  reverence and gratitude, and a solicitation of the more immediate presence of the
                  Deity. In the front of the area was a kind of stile, where the relations of the
                  deceased stood to pay the tribute of their sorrow; and under the awning were
                  innumerable small pieces of cloth, on which the tears and blood of the mourners
                  had been shed; for in their paroxysms of grief it is a universal custom to wound
                  themselves with the shark's tooth. Within a few yards two occasional houses were
                  set up, in one of which some relations of the deceased constantly resided, and in
                  the other the chief mourner, who is always a man, and who keeps there a very
                  singular dress in which a ceremony is performed that will be described in its
                  turn. Near the place where the dead are thus set up to rot, the bones are
                  afterwards buried. </p><p n="269">What can have introduced among these people the custom of exposing their
                  dead above ground, till the flesh is consumed by putrefaction, and then burying
                  the bones, it is perhaps impossible to guess; but it is remarkable, that Aelian
                  and Apollonius Rhodius impute a similar practice to the ancient inhabitants of
                  Colchis, a country near Pontus in Asia, now called Mingrelia; except that among
                  them this manner of disposing of the dead did not extend to both sexes: the women
                  they buried; but the men they wrapped in a hide, and hung up in the air by a
                  chain. This practice among the Colchians is referred to a religious cause. The
                  principal objects of their worship were the Earth and the Air; and it is supposed
                  that, in consequence of some superstitious notion, <pb n="144"/> they devoted
                  their dead to both.* Whether the natives of Otaheite had any notion of the same
                  kind we were never able certainly to determine; but we soon discovered, that the
                  repositories of their dead were also places of worship. Upon this occasion it may
                  be observed, that nothing can be more absurd than the notion that the happiness or
                  misery of a future life depends, in any degree, upon the disposition of the body
                  when the state of probation is past; yet that nothing is more general than a
                  solicitude about it. However cheap we may hold any funereal rites which custom has
                  not familiarized, or superstition rendered sacred, most men gravely deliberate how
                  to prevent their body from being broken by the mattock and devoured by the worm,
                  when it is no longer capable of sensation; and purchase a place for it in holy
                  ground, when they believe the lot of its future existence to be irrevocably
                  determined. So strong is the association of pleasing or painful ideas with certain
                  opinions and actions which affect us while we live, that we involuntarily act as
                  if it was equally certain that they would affect us in the same manner when we are
                  dead, though this is an opinion that nobody will maintain. Thus it happens, that
                  the desire of preserving from reproach even the name that we leave behind us, or
                  of procuring it honour, is one of the most powerful principles of action, among
                  the inhabitants of the most speculative and enlightened nations. Posthumous
                  reputation, upon every principle, must be acknowledged to have no influence upon
                  the dead; yet the desire of obtaining and securing it, no force of reason, no
                  habits of thinking can subdue, except in those whom habitual baseness and guilt
                  have rendered indifferent to honour and shame while they lived. This indeed seems
                  to be among the happy imperfections of our nature, upon which the general good of
                  society in a certain measure depends; for as some crimes are supposed to <pb n="145"/> be prevented by hanging the body of the criminal in chains after he
                  is dead,* so in consequence of the same association of ideas, much good is
                  procured to society, and much evil prevented, by a desire of preventing disgrace
                  or procuring honour to a name, when nothing but a name remains. </p><p n="270">Perhaps no better use can be made of reading an account of manners
                  altogether new, by which the follies and absurdities of mankind are taken out of
                  that particular connection in which habit has reconciled them to us, than to
                  consider in how many instances they are essentially the same. When an honest
                  devotee of the Church of Rome reads, that there are Indians on the banks of the
                  Ganges, who believe that they shall secure the happiness of a future state by
                  dying with a cow's tail in their hands, he laughs at their folly and superstition;
                  and if these Indians were to be told, that there are people upon the continent of
                  Europe, who imagine that they shall derive the same advantage from dying with the
                  slipper of a St. Francis upon their foot, they would laugh in their turn. But if,
                  when the Indian heard the account of the Catholic, and the Catholic that of the
                  Indian, each was to reflect, that there was no difference between the absurdity of
                  the slipper and of the tail; but that the veil of prejudice and custom, which
                  covered it in their own case, was withdrawn in the other, they would turn their
                  knowlege to a profitable purpose. </p><p n="271">Having observed that bread-fruit had for some days been brought in less
                  quantities than usual, we enquired the reason; and were told, that there being a
                  great show of fruit upon the trees, they had been thinned all at once, in order to
                  make a kind of sour paste, which the natives call Mahie, and which, in consequence
                  of having undergone a fermentation, will keep a considerable time, and supply them
                  with food when no ripe fruit is to be had. </p><p n="272"><pb n="146"/>*On the <date>10th</date>, the ceremony was to be performed, in honour of the old
                  woman whose sepulchral tabernacle has just been described, by the chief mourner;
                  and Mr. Banks had so great a curiosity to see all the mysteries of the solemnity,
                  that he determined to take a part in it, being told, that he could be present upon
                  no other condition. In the evening, therefore, he repaired to the place where the
                  body lay, and was received by the daughter of the deceased, and several other
                  persons, among whom was a boy about fourteen years old, who were to assist in the
                  ceremony. Tubourai Tamaide was to be the principal mourner; and his dress, which
                  was extremely fantastical, though not unbecoming, is represented by a figure in
                  one of the plates. Mr. Banks was stripped of his European clothes, and a small
                  piece of cloth being tied round his middle, his body was smeared with charcoal and
                  water, as low as the shoulders, till it was as black as that of a negroe: the same
                  operation was performed upon several others, among whom were some women, who were
                  reduced to a state as near to nakedness as himself; the boy was blacked all over,
                  and then the procession set forward. Tubourai Tamaide uttered something, which was
                  supposed to be a prayer, near the body; and did the same when he came up to his
                  own house: when this was done, the procession was continued towards the fort,
                  permission having been obtained to approach it upon this occasion. It is the
                  custom of the Indians to fly from these processions with the utmost precipitation,
                  so that as soon as those who were about the fort, saw it at a distance, they hid
                  themselves in the woods. It proceeded from the fort along the shore, and put to
                  flight another body of Indians, consisting of more than an hundred, every one
                  hiding himself under the first shelter that he could find: it then crossed the
                  river, and entered the woods, passing several houses, all which were deserted, and
                  not a <pb n="147"/> single Indian could be seen during the rest of the
                  procession,* which continued more than half an hour. The office that Mr. Banks
                  performed, was called that of the Nineveh, of which there were two besides
                  himself; and the natives having all disappeared, they came to the chief mourner,
                  and said imatata, there are no people, after which the company was dismissed to
                  wash themselves in the river, and put on their customary apparel. </p><p n="273">On the <date>12th</date>, complaint being made to me,* by some of the natives, that two
                  of the seamen had taken from them several bows and arrows, and some strings of
                  plaited hair, I examined the matter, and finding the charge well supported, I
                  punished each of the criminals with two dozen lashes. </p><p n="274">Their bows and arrows have not been mentioned before, nor were they often
                  brought down to the fort: This day, however, Tubourai Tamaide brought down his, in
                  consequence of a challenge which he had received from Mr. Gore. The Chief supposed
                  it was to try who could send the arrow farthest; Mr. Gore, who best could hit a
                  mark: and as Mr. Gore did not value himself upon shooting to a great distance, nor
                  the Chief upon hitting a mark, there was no trial of skill between them. Tubourai
                  Tamaide, however, to shew us what he could do, drew his bow, and sent an arrow,
                  none of which are feathered, two hundred and seventy-four yards, which is
                  something more than a seventh, and something less than a sixth part of a mile.
                  Their manner of shooting is somewhat singular; they kneel down, and the moment the
                  arrow is discharged, drop the bow. </p><p n="275">Mr. Banks, in his morning walk this day, met a number of the natives whom,
                  upon enquiry, he found to be travelling musicians; and having learnt where they
                  were to be at night, we all repaired to the place. The band consisted of <pb n="148"/> two flutes and three drums,* and we found a great number of people
                  assembled upon the occasion. The drummers accompanied the musick with their
                  voices, and, to our great surprize, we discovered that we were generally the
                  subject of the song. We did not expect to have found among the uncivilized
                  inhabitants of this sequestered spot, a character, which has been the subject of
                  such praise and veneration where genius and knowlege have been most conspicuous;
                  yet these were the bards or minstrels of Otaheite. Their song was unpremeditated,
                  and accompanied with musick; they were continually going about from place to
                  place, and they were rewarded by the master of the house, and the audience, with
                  such things as one wanted and the other could spare. </p><p n="276">*On the <date>14th</date>, we were brought into new difficulties and inconvenience by
                  another robbery at the fort. In the middle of the night, one of the natives
                  contrived to steal an iron coal-rake, that was made use of for the oven. It
                  happened to be set up against the inside of the wall, so that the top of the
                  handle was visible from without; and we were informed that the thief, who had been
                  seen lurking there in the evening, came secretly about three o'clock in the
                  morning, and, watching his opportunity when the centinel's back was turned, very
                  dexterously laid hold of it with a long crooked stick, and drew it over the wall.
                  I thought it of some consequence, if possible, to put an end to these practices at
                  once, by doing something that should make it the common interest of the natives
                  themselves, to prevent them. I had given strict orders that they should not be
                  fired upon, even when detected in these attempts, for which I had many reasons:
                  the common centinels were by no means fit to be entrusted with a power of life and
                  death, to be exerted whenever they should think fit, and I had already experienced
                  that they <pb n="149"/> were ready to take away the lives that were in their
                  power,* upon the slightest occasion; neither indeed did I think that the thefts
                  which these people committed against us, were, in them, crimes worthy of death:
                  that thieves are hanged in England, I thought no reason why they should be shot in
                  Otaheite; because, with respect to the natives, it would have been an execution by
                  a law ex post facto: they had no such law among themselves, and it did not appear
                  to me that we had any right to make such a law for them. That they should abstain
                  from theft, or be punished with death, was not one of the conditions under which
                  they claimed the advantages of civil society, as it is among us; and as I was not
                  willing to expose them to fire-arms, loaded with shot, neither could I perfectly
                  approve of firing only with powder: at first, indeed, the noise and the smoke
                  would alarm them, but when they found that no mischief followed, they would be led
                  to despise the weapons themselves, and proceed to insults, which would make it
                  necessary to put them to the test, and from which they would be deterred by the
                  very sight of a gun, if it was never used but with effect. At this time, an
                  accident furnished me with what I thought a happy expedient. It happened that
                  above twenty of their sailing canoes were just come in with a supply of fish: upon
                  these I immediately seized, and bringing them into the river behind the fort, gave
                  publick notice, that except the rake, and all the rest of the things which from
                  time to time had been stolen, were returned, the canoes should be burnt. This
                  menace I ventured to publish, though I had no design to put it into execution,
                  making no doubt but that it was well known in whose possession the stolen goods
                  were, and that as restitution was thus made a common cause, they would all of them
                  in a short time be brought back. A list of the things was made out, consisting
                  principally of the rake, the musquet which <pb n="150"/> had been taken from the
                  marine when the Indian was shot;* the pistols which Mr. Banks lost with his
                  clothes at Atahourou; a sword belonging to one of the petty officers, and the
                  water cask. About noon, the rake was restored, and great solicitation was made for
                  the release of the canoes; but I still insisted upon my original condition.* The
                  next day came, and nothing farther was restored, at which I was much surprised,
                  for the people were in the utmost distress for the fish, which in a short time
                  would be spoilt; I was, therefore, reduced to a disagreeable situation, either of
                  releasing the canoes, contrary to what I had solemnly and publickly declared, or
                  to detain them, to the great injury of those who were innocent, without answering
                  any good purpose to ourselves: as a temporary expedient, I permitted them to take
                  the fish; but still detained the canoes. This very licence, however, was
                  productive of new confusion and injury; for, it not being easy at once to
                  distinguish to what particular persons the several lots of fish belonged, the
                  canoes were plundered, under favour of this circumstance, by those who had no
                  right to any part of their cargo. Most pressing instances were still made that the
                  canoes might be restored, and I having now the greatest reason to believe, either
                  that the things for which I detained them were not in the island, or that those
                  who suffered by their detention had not sufficient influence over the thieves to
                  prevail upon them to relinquish their booty, determined at length to give them up,
                  not a little mortified at the bad success of my project. </p><p n="277">Another accident also about this time was, notwithstanding all our
                  caution, very near embroiling us with the Indians. I sent the boat on shore with
                  an officer to get ballast for the ship, and not immediately finding stones
                  convenient for the purpose, he began to pull down some part of an inclosure where
                  they deposited the bones of their dead: this <pb n="151"/> the Indians violently
                  opposed,* and a messenger came down to the tents to acquaint the officers that
                  they would not suffer it. Mr. Banks immediately repaired to the place, and an
                  amicable end was soon put to the dispute, by sending the boat's crew to the river,
                  where stones enough were to be gathered without a possibility of giving offence.
                  It is very remarkable, that these Indians appeared to be much more jealous of what
                  was done to the dead than the living. This was the only measure in which they
                  ventured to oppose us, and the only insult that was offered to any individual
                  among us was upon a similar occasion. Mr. Monkhouse happening one day to pull a
                  flower from a tree which grew in one of their sepulchral inclosures, an Indian,
                  whose jealousy had probably been upon the watch, came suddenly behind him, and
                  struck him: Mr. Monkhouse laid hold of him, but he was instantly rescued by two
                  more, who took hold of Mr. Monkhouse's hair, and forced him to quit his hold of
                  their companion, and then ran away without offering him any farther violence. </p><p n="278">In the evening of the <date>19th</date>,* while the canoes were still detained, we
                  received a visit from Oberea, which surprised us not a little, as she brought with
                  her none of the things that had been stolen, and knew that she was suspected of
                  having some of them in her custody. She said indeed, that her favourite Obadee,
                  whom she had beaten and dismissed, had taken them away; but she seemed conscious,
                  that she had no right to be believed: she discovered the strongest signs of fear,
                  yet she surmounted it with astonishing resolution; and was very pressing to sleep
                  with her attendants in Mr. Banks's tent. In this, however, she was not gratified;
                  the affair of the jackets was too recent, and the tent was besides filled with
                  other people. No body else seemed willing to entertain <pb n="152"/> her,* and she
                  therefore, with great appearance of mortification and disappointment, spent the
                  night in her canoe. </p><p n="279">*The next morning early, she returned to the fort, with her canoe and
                  every thing that it contained, putting herself wholly into our power, with
                  something like greatness of mind, which excited our wonder and admiration. As the
                  most effectual means to bring about a reconciliation, she presented us with a hog,
                  and several other things, among which was a dog. We had lately learnt, that these
                  animals were esteemed by the Indians as more delicate food than their pork; and
                  upon this occasion we determined to try the experiment: the dog, which was very
                  fat, we consigned over to Tupia, who undertook to perform the double office of
                  butcher and cook. He killed him by holding his hands close over his mouth and
                  nose, an operation which continued above a quarter of an hour. While this was
                  doing, a hole was made in the ground about a foot deep, in which a fire was
                  kindled, and some small stones placed in layers alternately with the wood to heat;
                  the dog was then singed, by holding him over the fire, and, by scraping him with a
                  shell, the hair taken off as clean as if he had been scalded in hot water: he was
                  then cut up with the same instrument, and his entrails being taken out, were sent
                  to the sea, where being carefully washed, they were put into cocoa-nut shells,
                  with what blood had come from the body: when the hole was sufficiently heated, the
                  fire was taken out, and some of the stones, which were not so hot as to discolour
                  any thing that they touched, being placed at the bottom, were covered with green
                  leaves: the dog, with the entrails, was then placed upon the leaves, and other
                  leaves being laid upon them, the whole was covered with the rest of the hot
                  stones, and the mouth of the hole close stopped with mould: in somewhat less than
                  four hours it <pb n="153"/> was again opened, and the dog taken out excellently
                  baked,* and we all agreed that he made a very good dish. The dogs which are here
                  bred to be eaten, taste no animal food, but are kept wholly upon bread-fruit,
                  cocoa-nuts, yams, and other vegetables of the like kind: all the flesh and fish
                  eaten by the inhabitants is dressed in the same way. </p><p n="280">On the <date>21st</date>, we were visited at the fort by a Chief,* called OAMO, whom we
                  had never seen before, and who was treated by the natives with uncommon respect;
                  he brought with him a boy about seven years old, and a young woman about sixteen:
                  the boy was carried upon a man's back, which we considered as a piece of state,
                  for he was as well able to walk as any present. As soon as they were in sight,
                  Oberea, and several other natives who were in the fort, went out to meet them,
                  having first uncovered their heads and bodies as low as the waist: as they came
                  on, the same ceremony was performed by all the natives who were without the fort.
                  Uncovering the body, therefore, is in this country probably a mark of respect; and
                  as all parts are here exposed with equal indifference, the ceremony of uncovering
                  it from the waist downwards, which was performed by Oorattooa, might be nothing
                  more than a different mode of compliment, adapted to persons of a different rank.
                  The Chief came into the tent, but no entreaty could prevail upon the young woman
                  to follow him, though she seemed to refuse contrary to her inclination: the
                  natives without were indeed all very solicitous to prevent her; sometimes, when
                  her resolution seemed to fail, almost using force: the boy also they restrained in
                  the same manner; but Dr. Solander happening to meet him at the gate, took him by
                  the hand, and led him in before the people were aware of it: as soon, however, as
                  those that were within saw him, they took care to have him sent out. </p><p n="281"><pb n="154"/>*These circumstances having strongly excited our curiosity, we
                  enquired who they were, and were informed, that Oamo was the husband of Oberea,
                  though they had been a long time separated by mutual consent; and that the young
                  woman and the boy were their children. We learnt also, that the boy, whose name
                  was TERRIDIRI, was heir apparent to the sovereignty of the island, and that his
                  sister was intended for his wife, the marriage being deferred only till he should
                  arrive at a proper age. The sovereign at this time was a son of WHAPPAI, whose
                  name was OUTOU, and who, as before has been observed, was a minor. Whappai, Oamo,
                  and Tootahah, were brothers: Whappai was the eldest, and Oamo the second; so that,
                  Whappai having no child but Outou, Terridiri, the son of his next brother Oamo,
                  was heir to the sovereignty. It will, perhaps, seem strange that a boy should be
                  sovereign during the life of his father; but, according to the custom of the
                  country, a child succeeds to a father's title and authority as soon as it is born:
                  a regent is then elected, and the father of the new sovereign is generally
                  continued in his authority, under that title, till his child is of age; but, at
                  this time, the choice had fallen upon Tootahah, the uncle, in consequence of his
                  having distinguished himself in a war. Oamo asked many questions concerning
                  England and its inhabitants, by which he appeared to have great shrewdness and
                  understanding. </p></div><pb n="155"/><div type="chapter" n="15"><head><l>CHAP.XV.</l><l><emph rend="italic"> An Account of the Circumnavigation of the Island, and
                        various Incidents that happened during the Expedition; with a Description of
                        a Burying-place and Place of Worship, called a Morai.</emph></l></head><p n="282">ON Monday the <date>26th</date>,* about three o'clock in the morning, I set out in the
                  pinnace, accompanied by Mr. Banks, to make the circuit of the island, with a view
                  to sketch out the coast and harbours. We took our route to the eastward, and about
                  eight in the forenoon we went on shore, in a district called OAHOUNUE, which is
                  governed by AHIO, a young Chief, whom we had often seen at the tents, and who
                  favoured us with his company to breakfast. Here also we found two other natives of
                  our old acquaintance, TITUBOALO and HOONA, who carried us to their houses, near
                  which we saw the body of the old woman, at whose funeral rites Mr. Banks had
                  assisted, and which had been removed hither from the spot where it was first
                  deposited, this place having descended from her by inheritance to Hoona, and it
                  being necessary on that account that it should lie here. We then proceeded on
                  foot, the boat attending within call, to the harbour in which Mr. Bougainville
                  lay, called OHIDEA, where the natives shewed us the ground upon which his people
                  pitched their tent, and the brook at which they watered, though no trace of them
                  remained, except the holes where the poles of the tent had been fixed, and a small
                  piece of potsheard, which Mr. Banks found in looking narrowly about the spot. We
                  met, however, with ORETTE, a Chief <pb n="156"/> who was their principal friend,*
                  and whose brother OUTORROU went away with them. </p><p n="283">This harbour lies on the west side of a great bay, under shelter of a
                  small island called BOOUROU, near which is another called TAAWIRRII; the breach in
                  the reefs is here very large, but the shelter for the ships is not the best. </p><p n="284">Soon after we had examined this place, we took boat, and asked Tituboalo
                  to go with us to the other side of the bay; but he refused, and advised us not to
                  go, for he said the country there was inhabited by people who were not subject to
                  Tootahah, and who would kill both him and us. Upon receiving this intelligence, we
                  did not, as may be imagined, relinquish our enterprize; but we immediately loaded
                  our pieces with ball: this was so well understood by Tituboalo as a precaution
                  which rendered us formidable, that he now consented to be of our party. </p><p n="285">Having rowed till it was dark, we reached a low neck of land, or isthmus,
                  at the bottom of the bay, that divides the island into two peninsulas, each of
                  which is a district or government wholly independent of the other. From
                  Port-Royal, where the ship was at anchor, the coast trends E. by S. and E. S. E.
                  ten miles, then S. by E. and S. eleven miles to the isthmus. In the first
                  direction, the shore is in general open to the sea; but in the last it is covered
                  by reefs of rocks, which form several good harbours, with safe anchorage, in 16,
                  18, 20, and 24 fathom of water, with other conveniences. As we had not yet got
                  into our enemy's country, we determined to sleep on shore: we landed, and though
                  we found but few houses, we saw several double canoes whose owners were well known
                  to us, and who provided us with supper and lodging; of which Mr. Banks was
                  indebted for his <pb n="157"/> share to Ooratooa,* the lady who had paid him her
                  compliments in so singular a manner at the fort. </p><p n="286">In the morning, we looked about the country,* and found it to be a marshy
                  flat, about two miles over, across which the natives haul their canoes to the
                  corresponding bay on the other side. We then prepared to continue our rout for
                  what Tituboalo called the other kingdom; he said that the name of it was
                  TIARRABOU, or OTAHEITE ETE; and that of the Chief who governed it, WAHEATUA: upon
                  this occasion also, we learnt that the name of the peninsula where we had taken
                  our station was OPOUREONU, or OTAHEITE NUE. Our new associate seemed to be now in
                  better spirits than he had been the day before; the people in Tiarrabou would not
                  kill us, he said, but he assured us that we should be able to procure no victuals
                  among them; and indeed we had seen no bread-fruit since we set out. </p><p n="287">After rowing a few miles, we landed in a district, which was the dominion
                  of a Chief called MARAITATA, the burying-place of men; whose father's name was
                  PAHAIREDO, the stealer of boats. Though these names seemed to favour the account
                  that had been given by Tituboalo, we soon found that it was not true. Both the
                  father and the son received us with the greatest civility, gave us provisions,
                  and, after some delay, sold us a very large hog for a hatchet. A crowd soon
                  gathered round us, but we saw only two people that we knew; neither did we observe
                  a single bead or ornament among them that had come from our ship, though we saw
                  several things which had been brought from Europe. In one of the houses lay two
                  twelve-pound shot, one of which was marked with the broad arrow of England, though
                  the people said they had them from the ships that lay in Bougainville's harbour. </p><p n="288"><pb n="158"/>*We proceeded on foot till we came to the district which was
                  immediately under the government of the principal Chief, or King of the peninsula,
                  Waheatua. Waheatua had a son, but whether, according to the custom of Opoureonu,
                  he administered the government as regent, or in his own right, is uncertain. This
                  district consists of a large and fertile plain, watered by a river so wide, that
                  we were obliged to ferry over it in a canoe; our Indian train, however, chose to
                  swim, and took to the water with the same facility as a pack of hounds. In this
                  place we saw no house that appeared to be inhabited, but the ruins of many, that
                  had been very large. We proceeded along the shore, which forms a bay, called
                  OAITIPEHA, and at last we found the Chief sitting near some pretty canoe awnings,
                  under which, we supposed, he and his attendants slept. He was a thin old man, with
                  a very white head and beard, and had with him a comely woman, about five and
                  twenty years old, whose name was TOUDIDDE. We had often heard the name of this
                  woman, and, from report and observation, we had reason to think that she was the
                  OBEREA of this peninsula. From this place, between which and the isthmus there are
                  other harbours, formed by the reefs that lie along the shore, where shipping may
                  lie in perfect security, and from whence the land trends S. S. E. and S. to the S.
                  E. part of the island, we were accompanied by TEAREE, the son of Waheatua, of whom
                  we had purchased a hog, and the country we passed through appeared to be more
                  cultivated than any we had seen in other parts of the island: the brooks were
                  every where banked into narrow channels with stone, and the shore had also a
                  facing of stone, where it was washed by the sea. The houses were neither large nor
                  numerous, but the canoes that were hauled up along the shore were almost
                  innumerable, and superior to any that we had seen before, both in size and <pb n="159"/> make; they were longer, the sterns were higher,* and the awnings were
                  supported by pillars. At almost every point there was a sepulchral building, and
                  there were many of them also in land. They were of the same figure as those in
                  Opoureonu, but they were cleaner and better kept, and decorated with many carved
                  boards, which were set upright, and on the top of which were various figures of
                  birds and men: on one in particular, there was the representation of a cock, which
                  was painted red and yellow, to imitate the feathers of that animal, and rude
                  images of men were, in some of them, placed one upon the head of another. But in
                  this part of the country, however fertile and cultivated, we did not see a single
                  bread-fruit; the trees were entirely bare, and the inhabitants seemed to subsist
                  principally upon nuts which are not unlike a chesnut, and which they call Ahee. </p><p n="289">When we had walked till we were weary, we called up the boat, but both our
                  Indians, Tituboalo and Tuahow, were missing: they had, it seems, stayed behind at
                  Waheatua's, expecting us to return thither, in consequence of a promise which had
                  been extorted from us, and which we had it not in our power to fulfil. </p><p n="290">Tearee, however, and another, embarked with us, and we proceeded till we
                  came a-breast of a small island called OTOOAREITE; it being then dark, we
                  determined to land, and our Indians conducted us to a place where they said we
                  might sleep: it was a deserted house, and near it was a little cove, in which the
                  boat might lie with great safety and convenience. We were, however, in want of
                  provisions, having been very sparingly supplied since we set out; and Mr. Banks
                  immediately went into the woods to see whether any could be procured. As it was
                  dark; he met with no people, and could find but one house that was inhabited: a
                  bread-fruit <pb n="160"/> and a half,* a few Ahees, and some fire, were all that
                  it afforded; upon which, with a duck or two, and a few curlieus, we made our
                  supper, which, if not scanty, was disagreeable, by the want of bread, with which
                  we had neglected to furnish ourselves, as we depended upon meeting with
                  bread-fruit, and took up our lodging under the awning of a canoe belonging to
                  Tearee, which followed us. </p><p n="291">*The next morning, after having spent some time in another fruitless
                  attempt to procure a supply of provisions, we proceeded round the south east
                  point, part of which is not covered by any reef, but lies open to the sea; and
                  here the hill rises directly from the shore. At the southermost part of the
                  island, the shore is again covered by a reef, which forms a good harbour; and the
                  land about it is very fertile. We made this rout partly on foot and partly in the
                  boat: when we had walked about three miles, we arrived at a place where we saw
                  several large canoes, and a number of people with them, whom we were agreeably
                  surprised to find were of our intimate acquaintance. Here, with much difficulty,
                  we procured some cocoa-nuts, and then embarked, taking with us Tuahow, one of the
                  Indians who had waited for us at Waheatua's, and had returned the night before,
                  long after it was dark. </p><p n="292">When we came a-breast of the south-east end of the island, we went ashore,
                  by the advice of our Indian guide, who told us that the country was rich and good.
                  The Chief, whose name was MATHIABO, soon came down to us, but seemed to be a total
                  stranger both to us and to our trade: his subjects, however, brought us plenty of
                  cocoa-nuts, and about twenty bread-fruit. The bread-fruit we bought at a very dear
                  rate, but his excellency sold us a pig for a glass bottle, which he preferred to
                  every thing else that we could give <pb n="161"/> him. We found in his possession
                  a goose and a turkey-cock,* which, we were informed, had been left upon the island
                  by the Dolphin: they were both enormously fat, and so tame that they followed the
                  Indians, who were fond of them to excess, wherever they went. </p><p n="293">In a long house in this neighbourhood, we saw what was altogether new to
                  us. At one end of it, fastened to a semicircular board, hung fifteen human
                  jaw-bones; they appeared to be fresh, and there was not one of them that wanted a
                  single tooth. A sight so extraordinary, strongly excited our curiosity, and we
                  made many enquiries about it; but at this time could get no information, for the
                  people either could not, or would not understand us. </p><p n="294">When we left this place, the Chief, Mathiabo, desired leave to accompany
                  us, which was readily granted. He continued with us the remainder of the day, and
                  proved very useful, by piloting us over the shoals. In the evening, we opened the
                  bay on the north west side of the island, which answered to that on the south
                  east, so as at the isthmus, or carrying-place, almost to intersect the island, as
                  I have observed before; and when we had coasted about two-thirds of it, we
                  determined to go on shore for the night. We saw a large house at some distance,
                  which, Mathiabo informed us, belonged to one of his friends; and soon after
                  several canoes came off to meet us, having on board some very handsome women, who,
                  by their behaviour, seemed to have been sent to entice us on shore. As we had
                  before resolved to take up our residence here for the night, little invitation was
                  necessary. We found that the house belonged to the Chief of the district, whose
                  name was WIVEROU; he received us in a very friendly manner, and ordered his people
                  to assist us in dressing our provision, of which we had now got a tolerable <pb n="162"/> stock.* When our supper was ready, we were conducted into that part
                  of the house where Wiverou was sitting, in order to eat it; Mathiabo supped with
                  us, and Wiverou calling for his supper at the same time, we eat our meal very
                  sociably, and with great good-humour. When it was over, we began to enquire where
                  we were to sleep, and a part of the house was shewn us, of which we were told we
                  might take possession for that purpose. We then sent for our cloaks, and Mr. Banks
                  began to undress, as his custom was, and, with a precaution which he had been
                  taught by the loss of the jackets at Atahourou, sent his clothes aboard the boat,
                  proposing to cover himself with a piece of Indian cloth. When Mathiabo perceived
                  what was doing, he also pretended to want a cloak; and, as he had behaved very
                  well, and done us some service, a cloak was ordered for him. We lay down, and
                  observed that Mathiabo was not with us; but we supposed that he was gone to bathe,
                  as the Indians always do before they sleep. We had not waited long, however, when
                  an Indian, who was a stranger to us, came and told Mr. Banks, that the cloak and
                  Mathiabo had disappeared together. This man had so far gained our confidence, that
                  we did not at first believe the report; but it being soon after confirmed by
                  Tuahow, our own Indian, we knew no time was to be lost. As it was impossible for
                  us to pursue the thief with any hope of success, without the assistance of the
                  people about us, Mr. Banks started up, and telling our case, required them to
                  recover the cloak; and to enforce his requisition, shewed one of his pocket
                  pistols, which he always kept about him. Upon the sight of the pistol, the whole
                  company took the alarm, and, instead of assisting to catch the thief, or recover
                  what had been stolen, began with great precipitation to leave the place; one of
                  them, however, was seized, upon which he immediately offered to direct the chace:
                  I set out therefore <pb n="163"/> with Mr. Banks, and though we ran all the way,*
                  the alarm had got before us, for in about ten minutes we met a man bringing back
                  the cloak, which the thief had relinquished in great terror; and as we did not
                  then think fit to continue the pursuit, he made his escape. When we returned, we
                  found the house, in which there had been between two and three hundred people,
                  entirely deserted. It being, however, soon known that we had no resentment against
                  any body but Mathiabo, the Chief Wiverou, our host, with his wife and many others,
                  returned, and took up their lodging with us for the night. In this place, however,
                  we were destined to more confusion and trouble, for about five o'clock in the
                  morning our sentry alarmed us, with an account that the boat was missing: he had
                  seen her, he said, about half an hour before, at her grappling, which was not
                  above fifty yards from the shore; but upon hearing the sound of oars, he had
                  looked out again, and could see nothing of her. At this account we started up
                  greatly alarmed, and ran to the water side: the morning was clear and star light,
                  so that we could see to a considerable distance, but there was no appearance of
                  the boat. Our situation was now such as might justify the most terrifying
                  apprehensions; as it was a dead calm, and we could not therefore suppose her to
                  have broken from her grappling, we had great reason to fear that the Indians had
                  attacked her, and finding the people asleep, had succeeded in their enterprize: we
                  were but four, with only one musquet and two pocket pistols, without a spare ball
                  or charge of powder for either. In this state of anxiety and distress we remained
                  a considerable time, expecting the Indians every moment to improve their
                  advantage, when, to our unspeakable satisfaction, we saw the boat return, which
                  had been driven from her grappling by the tide; a circumstance <pb n="164"/> to
                  which,* in our confusion and surprise, we did not advert. </p><p n="295">*As soon as the boat returned, we got our breakfast, and were impatient to
                  leave the place, lest some other vexatious accident should befal us. It is
                  situated on the north side of Tiarrabou, the south east peninsula, or division, of
                  the island, and at the distance of about five miles south east from the isthmus,
                  having a large and commodious harbour, inferior to none in the island, about which
                  the land is very rich in produce. Notwithstanding we had had little communication
                  with this division, the inhabitants every where received us in a friendly manner;
                  we found the whole of it fertile and populous, and, to all appearance, in a more
                  flourishing state than Opoureonu, though it is not above one fourth part as large. </p><p n="296">The next district in which we landed, was the last in Tiarrabou, and
                  governed by a Chief, whose name we understood to be OMOE. Omoe was building a
                  house, and being therefore very desirous of procuring a hatchet, he would have
                  been glad to have purchased one with any thing that he had in his possession; it
                  happened, however, rather unfortunately for him and us, that we had not one
                  hatchet left in the boat. We offered to trade with nails, but he would not part
                  with any thing in exchange for them; we therefore reimbarked, and put off our
                  boat, but the Chief being unwilling to relinquish all hope of obtaining something
                  from us that would be of use to him, embarked in a canoe, with his wife
                  WHANNO-OUDA, and followed us. After some time, we took them into the boat, and
                  when we had rowed about a league, they desired we would put ashore: we immediately
                  complied with his request, and found some of his people <pb n="165"/> who had
                  brought down a very large hog.* We were as unwilling to lose the hog, as the Chief
                  was to part with us, and it was indeed worth the best axe we had in the ship; we
                  therefore hit upon an expedient, and told him, that if he would bring his hog to
                  the fort at MATAVAI, the Indian name for Port Royal bay, he should have a large
                  axe, and a nail into the bargain, for his trouble. To this proposal, after having
                  consulted with his wife, he agreed, and gave us a large piece of his country cloth
                  as a pledge that he would perform, his agreement, which, however, he never did. </p><p n="297">At this place we saw a very singular curiosity: it was the figure of a
                  man, constructed of basket work, rudely made, but not ill designed; it was
                  something more than seven feet high, and rather too bulky in proportion to its
                  height. The wicker skeleton was completely covered with feathers, which were white
                  where the skin was to appear, and black in the parts which it is their custom to
                  paint or stain, and upon the head, where there was to be a representation of hair:
                  upon the head also were four protuberances, three in front and one behind, which
                  we should have called horns, but which the Indians dignified with the name of TATE
                  ETE, little men. The image was called MANIOE, and was said to be the only one of
                  the kind in Otaheite. They attempted to give us an explanation of its use and
                  design, but we had not then acquired enough of their language to understand them.
                  We learnt, however, afterwards, that it was a representation of Mauwe, one of
                  their Eatuas, or gods of the second class. </p><p n="298">After having settled our affairs with Omoe, we proceeded on our return,
                  and soon reached Opoureonu, the north-west peninsula. After rowing a few miles, we
                  went on shore again, but the only thing we saw worth notice, was a repository for
                  the dead, uncommonly decorated: the pavement <pb n="166"/> was extremely neat,*
                  and upon it was raised a pyramid, about five feet high, which was intirely covered
                  with the fruits of two plants, peculiar to the country. Near the pyramid was a
                  small image of stone, of very rude workmanship, and the first instance of carving
                  in stone that we had seen among these people. They appeared to set a high value
                  upon it, for it was covered from the weather by a shed, that had been erected on
                  purpose. </p><p n="299">We proceeded in the boat, and passed through the only harbour, on the
                  south side of Opoureonu, that is fit for shipping. It is situated about five miles
                  to the westward of the isthmus, between two small islands that lie near the shore,
                  and about a mile distant from each other, and affords good anchorage in eleven and
                  twelve fathom water. We were now not far from the district called PAPARRA, which
                  belonged to our friends Oamo and Oberea, where we proposed to sleep. We went on
                  shore about an hour before night, and found that they were both absent, having
                  left their habitations to pay us a visit at Matavai: this, however, did not alter
                  our purpose, we took up our quarters at the house of Oberea, which, though small,
                  was very neat, and at this time had no inhabitant but her father, who received us
                  with looks that bid us welcome. Having taken possession, we were willing to
                  improve the little day-light that was left us, and therefore walked out to a
                  point, upon which we had seen, at a distance, trees that are here called Etoa,
                  which generally distinguish the places where these people bury the bones of their
                  dead: their name for such burying-grounds, which are also places of worship, is
                  MORAI. We were soon struck with the sight of an enormous pile, which, we were
                  told, was the Morai of Oamo and Oberea, and the principal piece of Indian
                  architecture in the island. It was a pile of stone work, raised pyramidically,
                  upon an oblong base, or square, <pb n="167"/> two hundred and sixty-seven feet
                  long,* and eighty-seven wide. It was built like the small pyramidal mounts upon
                  which we sometimes fix the pillar of a sun-dial, where each side is a flight of
                  steps; the steps, however, at the sides, were broader than those at the ends, so
                  that it terminated not in a square of the same figure with the base, but in a
                  ridge, like the roof of a house: there were eleven of these steps, each of which
                  was four feet high, so that the height of the pile was forty-four feet; each step
                  was formed of one course of white coral stone, which was neatly squared and
                  polished, the rest of the mass, for there was no hollow within, consisted of round
                  pebbles, which, from the regularity of their figure, seemed to have been wrought.
                  Some of the coral stones were very large; we measured one of them, and found it
                  three feet and an half by two feet and an half. The foundation was of rock stones,
                  which were also squared; and one of them measured four feet seven inches by two
                  feet four. Such a structure, raised without the assistance of iron tools to shape
                  the stones, or mortar to join them, struck us with astonishment: it seemed to be
                  as compact and firm as it could have been made by any workman in Europe, except
                  that the steps, which range along its greatest length, are not perfectly strait,
                  but sink in a kind of hollow in the middle, so that the whole surface, from end to
                  end, is not a right line, but a curve. The quarry stones, as we saw no quarry in
                  the neighbourhood, must have been brought from a considerable distance; and there
                  is no method of conveyance here but by hand: the coral must also have been fished
                  from under the water, where, though it may be found in plenty, it lies at a
                  considerable depth, never less than three feet. Both the rock stone and the coral
                  could be squared only by tools made of the same substance, which must have been a
                  work of incredible labour; but the polishing was more easily <pb n="168"/>
                  effected by means of the sharp coral sand,* which is found every where upon the
                  sea-shore in great abundance. In the middle of the top stood the image of a bird,
                  carved in wood; and near it lay the broken one of a fish, carved in stone. The
                  whole of this pyramid made part of one side of a spacious area or square, nearly
                  of equal sides, being three hundred and sixty feet by three hundred and
                  fifty-four, which was walled in with stone, and paved with flat stones in its
                  whole extent; though there were growing in it, notwithstanding the pavement,
                  several of the trees which they call Etoa, and plantains. About an hundred yards
                  to the west of this building, was another paved area or court, in which were
                  several small stages raised on wooden pillars, about seven feet high, which are
                  called by the Indians Ewattas, and seem to be a kind of altars, as upon these are
                  placed provisions of all kinds as offerings to their gods; we have since seen
                  whole hogs placed upon them, and we found here the sculls of above fifty, besides
                  the sculls of a great number of dogs. </p><p n="300">The principal object of ambition among these people is to have a
                  magnificent Morai, and this was a striking memorial of the rank and power of
                  Oberea. It has been remarked, that we did not find her invested with the same
                  authority that she exercised when the Dolphin was at this place, and we now learnt
                  the reason of it. Our way from her house to the Morai lay along the sea side, and
                  we observed every where under our feet a great number of human bones, chiefly ribs
                  and vertebrae. Upon enquiring into the cause of so singular an appearance, we were
                  told, that in the then last month of Owarahew, which answered to our December,
                  1768, about four or five months before our arrival, the people of Tiarrabou, the
                  S. E. peninsula which we had just visited, made a descent at this place, and
                  killed a great number of people, whose bones were those that we saw upon the
                  shore: <pb n="169"/> that, upon this occasion, Oberea, and Oamo,* who then
                  administered the government for his son, had fled to the mountains; and that the
                  conquerors burnt all the houses, which were very large, and carried away the hogs
                  and what other animals they found. We learnt also, that the turkey and goose,
                  which we had seen when we were with Mathiabo, the stealer of cloaks, were among
                  the spoils; this accounted for their being found among people with whom the
                  Dolphin had little or no communication; and upon mentioning the jaw-bones, which
                  we had seen hanging from a board in a long house, we were told, that they also had
                  been carried away as trophies, the people here carrying away the jaw-bones of
                  their enemies, as the Indians of North America do the scalps. </p><p n="301">After having thus gratified our curiosity, we returned to our quarters,
                  where we passed the night in perfect security and quiet. By the next evening we
                  arrived at Atahourou,* the residence of our friend Tootahah, where, the last time
                  we passed the night under his protection, we had been obliged to leave the best
                  part of our clothes behind us. This adventure, however, seemed now to be forgotten
                  on both sides. Our friends received us with great pleasure, and gave us a good
                  supper and a good lodging, where we suffered neither loss or disturbance. </p><p n="302">The next day, Saturday, July the <date>1st</date>,* we got back to our fort at Matavai,
                  having found the circuit of the island, including both peninsulas, to be about
                  thirty leagues. Upon our complaining of the want of bread-fruit, we were told,
                  that the produce of the last season was nearly exhausted; and that what was seen
                  sprouting upon the trees, would not be fit to use in less than three months; this
                  accounted for our having been able to procure so little of it in our route. </p><p n="303"><pb n="170"/>*While the bread-fruit is ripening upon the flats, the inhabitants
                  are supplied in some measure from the trees which they have planted upon the hills
                  to preserve a succession; but the quantity is not sufficient to prevent scarcity:
                  they live therefore upon the four paste which they call Mahie, upon wild
                  plantains, and ahee-nuts, which at this time are in perfection. How it happened
                  that the Dolphin, which was here at this season, found such plenty of bread-fruit
                  upon the trees, I cannot tell, except the season in which they ripen varies. </p><p n="304">At our return, our Indian friends crouded about us, and none of them came
                  empty-handed. Though I had determined to restore the canoes which had been
                  detained to their owners, it had not yet been done; but I now released them as
                  they were applied for. Upon this occasion I could not but remark with concern,
                  that these people were capable of practising petty frauds against each other, with
                  a deliberate dishonesty, which gave me a much worse opinion of them than I had
                  ever entertained from the robberies they committed under the strong temptation to
                  which a sudden opportunity of enriching themselves with the inestimable metal and
                  manufactures of Europe exposed them. </p><p n="305">Among others who applied to me for the release of a canoe, was one
                  POTATTOW, a man of some consequence, well known to us all. I consented, supposing
                  the vessel to be his own, or that he applied on the behalf of a friend: he went
                  immediately to the beach, and took possession of one of the boats, which, with the
                  assistance of his people, he began to carry off. Upon this, however, it was
                  eagerly claimed by the right owners, who, supported by the other Indians,
                  clamourously reproached him for invading their property, and prepared to take the
                  canoe from him by force. Upon this, he <pb n="171"/> desired to be heard, and told
                  them, that the canoe did,* indeed, once belong to those who claimed it; but that
                  I, having seized it as a forfeit, had sold it to him for a pig. This silenced the
                  clamour, the owners, knowing that from my power there was no appeal, acquiesced;
                  and Potattow would have carried off his prize, if the dispute had not fortunately
                  been overheard by some of our people who reported it to me. I gave orders
                  immediately that the Indians should be undeceived; upon which the right owners
                  took possession of their canoe, and Potattow was so conscious of his guilt, that
                  neither he nor his wife, who was privy to his knavery, could look us in the face
                  for some time afterwards. </p></div><pb n="172"/><div type="chapter" n="16"><head><l>CHAP.XVI.</l><l><emph rend="italic"> An Expedition of Mr. Banks to trace the River: Marks of

                        Tupai.</emph></l></head><p n="306">*ON the <date>3d</date>, Mr. Banks fet out early in the morning, with some Indian
                  guides, to trace our river up the valley from which it issues, and examine how far
                  it's banks were inhabited. For about six miles they met with houses, not far
                  distant from each other, on each side of the river, and the valley was every where
                  about four hundred yards wide from the foot of the hill on one side, to the foot
                  of that on the other; but they were now shewn a house which they were told was the
                  last that they would see. When they came up to it, the master of it offered them
                  refreshments of cocoa-nuts and other fruit, of which they accepted; after a short
                  stay, they walked forward for a considerable time; in bad way it is not easy to
                  compute distances, but they imagined that they had walked about six miles farther,
                  following the course of the river, when they frequently passed under vaults,
                  formed by fragments of the rock, in which they were told people who were benighted
                  frequently passed the night. Soon after they found the river banked by steep
                  rocks, from which a cascade, falling with great violence, formed a pool, so steep,
                  that the Indians said they could not pass it. They seemed, indeed, not much to be
                  acquainted with the valley beyond this place, their business lying chiefly upon
                  the declivity <pb n="173"/> of the rocks on each side,* and the plains which
                  extended on their summits, where they found plenty of a wild plantain, which they
                  called Vae. The way up these rocks from the banks of the river was in every
                  respect dreadful; the sides were nearly perpendicular, and in some places one
                  hundred feet high; they were also rendered exceeding slippery by the water of
                  innumerable springs which issued from the fissures on the surface: yet up these
                  precipices a way was to be traced by a succession of long pieces of the bark of
                  the Hibiscus tiliaceus, which served as a rope for the climber to take hold of,
                  and assisted him in scrambling from one ledge to another, though upon these ledges
                  there was footing only for an Indian or a goat. One of these ropes was nearly
                  thirty feet in length, and their guides offered to assist them in mounting this
                  pass, but recommended another at a little distance lower down, as less difficult
                  and dangerous. They took a view of this "better way," but found it so bad that
                  they did not to chuse to attempt it, as there was nothing at the top to reward
                  their toil and hazard but a grove of the wild plantain or Vae tree, which they had
                  often seen before. </p><p n="307">During this excursion, Mr. Banks had an excellent opportunity to examine
                  the rocks, which were almost every where naked, for minerals; but he found not the
                  least appearance of any. The stones every where, like those of Madeira, shewed
                  manifest tokens of having been burnt; nor is there a single specimen of any stone,
                  among all those that were collected in the island, upon which there are not
                  manifest and indubitable marks of fire; except perhaps some small pieces of the
                  hatchet-stone, and even of that, other fragments were collected which are burnt
                  almost to a pumice. Traces of fire are also manifest in the very clay upon the
                  hills; and it may, therefore, not unreasonably be supposed, that this, and the
                  neighbouring islands, are either shattered remains <pb n="174"/> of a continent,*
                  which some have supposed to be necessary in this part of the globe, to preserve an
                  equilibrium of its parts, which were left behind when the rest sunk by the mining
                  of a subterraneous fire, so as to give a passage to the sea over it; or were torn
                  from rocks, which, from the creation of the world, had been the bed of the sea,
                  and thrown up in heaps, to a height which the waters never reach. One or other of
                  these suppositions will perhaps be thought the more probable, as the water does
                  not gradually grow shallow as the shore is approached, and the islands are almost
                  every where surrounded by reefs, which appear to be rude and broken, as some
                  violent concussion would naturally leave the solid substance of the earth. It may
                  also be remarked upon this occasion, that the most probable cause of earthquakes
                  seems to be the sudden rushing in of water upon some vast mass of subterraneous
                  fire, by the instantaneous rarefaction of which into vapour, the mine is sprung,
                  and various substances, in all stages of vitrification, with shells, and other
                  marine productions, that are now found fossil, and the strata that covered the
                  furnace, are thrown up; while those parts of the land which were supported upon
                  the broken shell give way, and sink into the gulph. With this theory the
                  phaenomena of all earthquakes seem to agree; pools of water are frequently left
                  where land has subsided, and various substances, which manifestly appear to have
                  suffered by the action of fire, are thrown up. It is indeed true, that fire cannot
                  subsist without air; but this cannot be urged against there being fire below that
                  part of the earth which forms the bed of the sea; because there may be innumerable
                  fissures by which a communication between those parts and the external air may be
                  kept up, even upon the highest mountains, and at the greatest distance from the
                  sea-shore. </p><p n="308"><pb n="175"/>On the <date>4th</date>,* Mr. Banks employed himself in planting a great quantity
                  of the seeds of water-melons, oranges, lemons, limes, and other plants and trees
                  which be had collected at Rio de Janeiro. For these he prepared ground on each
                  side of the fort, with as many varieties of soil as he could chuse; and there is
                  little doubt but that they will succeed. He also gave liberally of these seeds to
                  the Indians, and planted many of them in the woods: some of the melon seeds having
                  been planted soon after our arrival, the natives shewed him several of the plants
                  which appeared to be in the most flourishing condition, and were continually
                  asking him for more. </p><p n="309">We now began to prepare for our departure, by bending the sails and
                  performing other necessary operations on board the ship, our water being already
                  on board, and the provisions examined. In the mean time we had another visit from
                  Oamo, Oberea, and their son and daughter; the Indians expressing their respect by
                  uncovering the upper parts of their body as they had done before. The daughter,
                  whose name we understood to be TOIMATA, was very desirous to see the fort, but her
                  father would by no means suffer her to come in. Tearee, the son of Waheatua, the
                  sovereign of Tiarrabou, the south east peninsula, was also with us at this time;
                  and we received intelligence of the landing of another guest, whose company was
                  neither expected nor desired: this was no other than the ingenious gentleman who
                  contrived to steal our quadrant. We were told, that he intended to try his fortune
                  again in the night; but the Indians all offered very zealously to assist us
                  against him, desiring that, for this purpose, they might be permitted to lie in
                  the fort. This had so good an effect, that the thief relinquished his enterprize
                  in despair. </p><p n="310"><pb n="176"/>*On the <date>7th</date>, the carpenters were employed in taking down the gates
                  and pallisadoes of our little fortification, for firewood on board the ship; and
                  one of the Indians had dexterity enough to steal the staple and hook upon which
                  the gate turned: he was immediately pursued, and after a chace of six miles, he
                  appeared to have been passed, having concealed himself among some rushes in the
                  brook; the rushes were searched, and though the thief had escaped, a scraper was
                  found which had been stolen from the ship sometime before; and soon after our old
                  friend Tubourai Tamaide brought us the staple. </p><p n="311">*On the <date>8th</date> and <date>9th</date>, we continued to dismantle our fort, and our friends
                  still flocked about us; some, I believe, sorry at the approach of our departure,
                  and others desirous to make as much as they could of us while we staid. </p><p n="312">We were in hopes that we should now leave the island, without giving or
                  receiving any other offence; but it unfortunately happened otherwise. Two foreign
                  seamen having been out with my permission, one of them was robbed of his knife,
                  and endeavouring to recover it, probably with circumstances of great provocation,
                  the Indians attacked him and dangerously wounded him with a stone; they wounded
                  his companion also slightly in the head, and then fled into the mountains. As I
                  should have been sorry to take any farther notice of the affair, I was not
                  displeased that the offenders had escaped; but I was immediately involved in a
                  quarrel which I very much regretted, and which yet it was not possible to avoid. </p><p n="313">In the middle of the night between the <date>8th</date> and <date>9th</date>, Clement Webb and
                  Samuel Gibson, two of the marines, both young men, went privately from the fort,
                  and in the morning were not to be found. As publick notice had been given, <pb n="177"/> that all hands were to go on board on the next day,* and that the
                  ship would sail on the morrow of that day or the day following, I began to fear
                  that the absentees intended to stay behind. I knew that I could take no effectual
                  steps to recover them, without endangering the harmony and good-will which at
                  present subsisted among us; and, therefore, determined to wait a day for the
                  chance of their return. </p><p n="314">On Monday morning the <date>10th</date>, the marines,* to my great concern, not being
                  returned, an enquiry was made after them of the Indians, who frankly told us, that
                  they did not intend to return, and had taken refuge in the mountains, where it was
                  impossible for our people to find them. They were then requested to assist in the
                  search, and after some deliberation, two of them undertook to conduct such persons
                  as I should think proper to send after them to the place of their retreat. As they
                  were known to be without arms, I thought two would be sufficient, and accordingly
                  dispatched a petty officer, and the corporal of the marines, with the Indian
                  guides, to fetch them back. As the recovery of these men was a matter of great
                  importance, as I had no time to lose, and as the Indians spoke doubtfully of their
                  return, telling us, that they had each of them taken a wife, and were become
                  inhabitants of the country, it was intimated to several of the Chiefs who were in
                  the fort with their women, among whom were Tubourai Tamaide, Tomio, and Oberea,
                  that they would not be permitted to leave it till our deserters were brought back.
                  This precaution I thought the more necessary, as, by concealing them a few days,
                  they might compel me to go without them; and I had the pleasure to observe, that
                  they received the intimation with very little signs either of fear or discontent;
                  assuring me that my people should be secured and sent back as soon as possible.
                  While this was doing at the fort, I sent Mr. Hicks in the pinnace to <pb n="178"/>
                  fetch Tootahah on board the ship,* which he did, without alarming either him or
                  his people. If the Indian guides proved faithful and in earnest, I had reason to
                  expect the return of my people with the deserters before evening. Being
                  disappointed, my suspicions increased; and night coming on, I thought it was not
                  safe to let the people whom I had detained as hostages continue at the fort, and I
                  therefore ordered Tubourai Tamaide, Oberea, and some others, to be taken on board
                  the ship. This spread a general alarm, and several of them, especially the women,
                  expressed their apprehensions with great emotion and many tears when they were put
                  into the boat. I went on board with them, and Mr. Banks remained on shore, with
                  some others whom I thought it of less consequence to secure. </p><p n="315">About nine o'clock, Webb was brought back by some of the natives, who
                  declared, that Gibson, and the petty officer and corporal, would be detained till
                  Tootahah should be set at liberty. The tables were now turned upon me; but I had
                  proceeded too far to retreat. I immediately dispatched Mr. Hicks in the long-boat,
                  with a strong party of men, to rescue the prisoners, and told tootahah that it
                  behoved him to send some of his people with them, with orders to afford them
                  effectual assistance, and to demand the release of my men in his name, for that I
                  should expect him to answer for the contrary. He readily complied; this party
                  recovered my men without the least opposition; and about seven o'clock in the
                  morning,* returned with them to the ship, though they had not been able to recover
                  the arms which had been taken from them when they were seized: these, however,
                  were brought on board in less than half an hour, and the Chiefs were immediately
                  set at liberty. </p><p n="316">When I questioned the petty officer concerning what had happened on shore,
                  he told me, that neither the natives who <pb n="179"/> went with him, nor those
                  whom they met in their way,* would give them any intelligence of the deserters;
                  but, on the contrary, became very troublesome: that, as he was returning for
                  further orders to the ship, he and his comrade were suddenly seized by a number of
                  armed men, who having learnt that Tootahah was confined, had concealed themselves
                  in a wood for that purpose, and, who having taken them at a disadvantage, forced
                  their weapons out of their hands, and declared, that they would detain them till
                  their Chief should be set at liberty. He said, however, that the Indians were not
                  unanimous in this measure; that some were for setting them at liberty, and others
                  for detaining them: that an eager dispute ensued, and that from words they came to
                  blows, but that the party for detaining them at length prevailed: that soon after,
                  Webb and Gibson were brought in by a party of the natives, as prisoners, that they
                  also might be secured as hostages for the Chief; but that it was after some debate
                  resolved to send Webb to inform me of their resolution, to assure me that his
                  companions were safe, and direct me where I might send my answer. Thus it appears
                  that whatever were the disadvantages of seizing the Chiefs, I should never have
                  recovered my men by any other method. When the Chiefs were set on shore from the
                  ship, those at the fort were also set at liberty, and, after staying with Mr.
                  Banks about an hour, they all went away. Upon this occasion, as they had done upon
                  another of the same kind, they expressed their joy by an undeserved liberality,
                  strongly urging us to accept of four hogs. These we absolutely refused as a
                  present, and they as absolutely refusing to be paid for them, the hogs did not
                  change masters. Upon examining the deserters, we found that the account which the
                  Indians had given of them was true: they had strongly attached themselves to two
                  girls, and it was their <pb n="180"/> intention to conceal themselves till the
                  ship had sailed,* and take up their residence upon the island. This night every
                  thing was got off from the shore, and every body slept on board. </p><p n="317">Among the natives who were almost constantly with us, was Tupia, whose
                  name has been often mentioned in this narrative. He had been, as I have before
                  observed, the first minister of Oberea, when she was in the height of her power:
                  he was also the chief Tahowa or priest of the island, consequently well acquainted
                  with the religion of the country; as well with respect to its ceremonies as
                  principles. He had also great experience and knowlege in navigation, and was
                  particularly acquainted with the number and situation of the neighbouring islands.
                  This man had often expressed a desire to go with us,* and on the <date>12th</date> in the
                  morning, having with the other natives left us the day before, he came on board,
                  with a boy about thirteen years of age, his servant, and urged us to let him
                  proceed with us on our voyage. To have such a person on board, was certainly
                  desirable for many reasons; by learning his language, and teaching him ours, we
                  should be able to acquire a much better knowlege of the customs, policy, and
                  religion of the people, than our short stay among them could give us, I therefore
                  gladly agreed to receive them on board. As we were prevented from sailing to-day,
                  by having found it necessary to make new stocks to our small and best bower
                  anchors, the old ones having been totally destroyed by the worms, Tupia said, he
                  would go once more on shore, and make a signal for the boat to fetch him off in
                  the evening. He went accordingly, and took with him a miniature picture of Mr.
                  Banks's, to shew his friends, and several little things to give them as parting
                  presents. </p><p n="318"><pb n="181"/>After dinner,* Mr. Banks being desirous to procure a drawing of the
                  Morai belonging to Tootahah at Eparré, I attended him thither, accompanied by Dr.
                  Solander, in the pinnace. As soon as we landed, many of our friends came to meet
                  us, though some absented themselves in resentment of what had happened the day
                  before. We immediately proceeded to Tootahah's house, were we were joined by
                  Oberea, with several others who had not come out to meet us, and a perfect
                  reconciliation was soon brought about; in consequence of which they promised to
                  visit us early the next day, to take a last farewel of us, as we told them we
                  should certainly set sail in the afternoon. At this place also we found Tupia, who
                  returned with us, and slept this night on board the ship for the first time. </p><p n="319">On the next morning, Thursday the <date>13th of July</date>,* the ship was very early
                  crouded with our friends, and surrounded by a multitude of canoes, which were
                  filled with the natives of an inferior class. Between eleven and twelve we weighed
                  anchor, and as soon as the ship was under sail, the Indians on board took their
                  leaves, and wept, with a decent and silent sorrow, in which there was something
                  very striking and tender: the people in the canoes, on the contrary, seemed to vie
                  with each other in the loudness of their lamentations, which we considered rather
                  as affectation than grief. Tupia sustained himself in this scene with a firmness
                  and resolution truly admirable: he wept indeed, but the effort that he made to
                  conceal his tears, concurred, with them, to do him honour. He sent his last
                  present, a shirt, by Otheothea, to Potomai, Tootahah's favourite mistress, and
                  then went with Mr. Banks to the mast-head, waving to the canoes as long as they
                  continued in sight. </p><p n="320"><pb n="182"/>*Thus we took leave of Otaheite, and its inhabitants, after a stay of
                  just three months; for much the greater part of the time we lived together in the
                  most cordial friendship, and a perpetual reciprocation of good offices. The
                  accidental differences which now and then happened, could not be more sincerely
                  regretted on their part than they were on ours: the principal causes were such as
                  necessarily resulted from our situation and circumstances, in conjunction with the
                  infirmities of human nature, from our not being able perfectly to understand each
                  other, and from the disposition of the inhabitants to theft, which we could not at
                  all times bear with or prevent. They had not, however, except in one instance,
                  been attended with any fatal consequence; and to that accident were owing the
                  measures that I took to prevent others of the same kind. I hoped, indeed, to have
                  availed myself of the impression which had been made upon them by the lives that
                  had been sacrificed in their contest with the Dolphin, so as that the intercourse
                  between us should have been carried on wholly without bloodshed; and by this hope
                  all my measures were directed during the whole of my continuance at the island,
                  and I sincerely wish, that whoever shall next visit it, may be still more
                  fortunate. Our traffick here was carried on with as much order as in the best
                  regulated market in Europe. It was managed principally by Mr. Banks, who was
                  indefatigable in procuring provision and refreshments while they were to be had;
                  but during the latter part of our time they became scarce, partly by the increased
                  consumption at the fort and ship, and partly by the coming on of the season in
                  which cocoa-nuts and bread-fruit fail. All kind of fruit we purchased for beads
                  and nails, but no nails less than fortypenny were current: after a very short time
                  we could never get a pig of more than ten or twelve pounds, for <pb n="183"/> less
                  than a hatchet; because,* though these people set a high value upon spike nails,
                  yet these being an article with which many people in the ship were provided, the
                  women found a much more easy way of procuring them than by bringing down
                  provisions. </p><p n="321">The best articles for traffick here are axes, hatchets, spikes, large
                  nails, looking-glasses, knives, and beads, for some of which, every thing that the
                  natives have may be procured. They are indeed fond of fine linen cloth, both white
                  and printed; but an ax worth half a crown, will fetch more than a piece of cloth
                  worth twenty shillings. </p></div><pb n="184"/><div type="chapter" n="17"><head><l>CHAP.XVII.</l><l><emph rend="italic"> A particular Description of the Island; its Produce and

                  Captain Wallis, who discovered it on the <date>9th of June</date> 1767, to be within half a
                  degree of the truth. We found Point Venus, the northern extremity of the island,
                  and the eastern point of the bay, to lie in the longitude of <geo select="lon">149° 30′</geo>
                  this being the mean result of a great number of observations made upon the spot.
                  The island is surrounded by a reef of coral rock, which forms several excellent
                  bays and harbours, some of which have been particularly described, where there is
                  room and depth of water for any number of the largest ships. Port-Royal bay,
                  called by the natives Matavai, which is not inferior to any in Otaheite, may
                  easily be known by a very high mountain in the middle of the island, which bears
                  due south from Point Venus. To sail into it, either keep the west point of the
                  reef that lies before Point Venus, close on board, or give it a birth of near half
                  a mile, in order to avoid a small shoal of coral rocks, on which there is but two
                  fathom and an half of water. The best anchoring is on the eastern side of the bay,
                  where there is sixteen and fourteen fathom upon an ousey bottom. The shore of the
                  bay is a fine sandy beach, behind which runs a river of fresh water, so that any
                  number of ships may water here without incommoding each other; but the only wood
                  for firing, upon the whole island, is that of <!--Page  [unnumbered]--></p><p n="323">[illustration] <!--Page  [unnumbered]--> [illustration]
                  <!--Page  [unnumbered]--> [illustration] <pb n="185"/> fruit trees, which must be
                  purchased of the natives,* or all hope of living upon good terms with them given
                  up. There are some harbours to the westward of this bay which have not been
                  mentioned, but, as they are contiguous to it, and laid down in the plan, a
                  description of them is unnecessary. The face of the country, except that part of
                  it which borders upon the sea, is very uneven; it rises in ridges that run up into
                  the middle of the island, and there form mountains, which may be seen at the
                  distance of sixty miles: between the foot of these ridges and the sea, is a border
                  of low land, surrounding the whole island, except in a few places where the ridges
                  rise directly from the sea: the border of low land is in different parts of
                  different breadths, but no where more than a mile and a half. The soil, except
                  upon the very tops of the ridges, is extremely rich and fertile, watered by a
                  great number of rivulets of excellent water, and covered with fruit trees of
                  various kinds, some of which are of a stately growth and thick foliage, so as to
                  form one continued wood; and even the tops of the ridges, through in general they
                  are bare, and burnt up by the sun, are, in some parts, not without their produce. </p><p n="324">The low land that lies between the foot of the ridges and the sea, and
                  some of the vallies, are the only parts of the island that are inhabited, and here
                  it is populous; the houses do not form villages or towns, but are ranged along the
                  whole border at the distance of about fifty yards from each other, with little
                  plantations of plantains, the tree which furnishes them with cloth. The whole
                  island, according to Tupia's account, who certainly knew, could furnish six
                  thousand seven hundred and eighty fighting men, from which the number of
                  inhabitants may easily be computed. </p><p n="325"><pb n="186"/>*The produce of this island is bread-fruit, cocoa-nuts, bananas, of
                  thirteen forts, the best we had ever eaten; plantains; a fruit not unlike an
                  apple, which, when ripe, is very pleasant; sweet potatoes, yams, cocoas, a kind of
                  Arum; a fruit known here by the name of Jambu, and reckoned most delicious; sugar
                  cane, which the inhabitants eat raw; a root of the salop kind, called by the
                  inhabitants Pea; a plant called Ethee, of which the root only is eaten; a fruit
                  that grows in a pod, like that of a large kidney-bean, which, when it is roasted,
                  eats very much like a chesnut, by the natives called Ahee; a tree called Wharra,
                  called in the East Indies Pandanes, which produces fruit, something like the
                  pine-apple; a shrub called Nono; the Morinda, which also produces fruit; a species
                  of fern, of which the root is eaten, and sometimes the leaves; and a plant called
                  Theve, of which the root also is eaten: but the fruits of the Nono, the fern, and
                  the Theve, are eaten only by the inferior people, and in times of scarcity. All
                  these, which serve the inhabitants for food, the earth produces spontaneously, or
                  with so little culture, that they seem to be exempted from the first general
                  curse, that "man should eat his bread in the sweat of his brow." They have also
                  the Chinese paper mulberry, morus papyrifera, which they call Aouta; a tree
                  resembling the wild fig-tree of the West Indies; another species of fig, which
                  they call Matte; the cordia sebestina orientalis, which they call Etou; a kind of
                  Cyperus grass, which they call Moo; a species of tournefortia, which they call
                  Taheinoo; another of the convolvulus poluce, which they call Eurhe; the solanum
                  centifolium, which they call Ebaoa; the calophyllum mophylum, which they call
                  Tamannu; the hibiscus tiliaceus, called Poerou, a frutescent nettle; the urtica
                  argentea, called Erowa; with many other plants which cannot here be particularly
                  mentioned: those that have been named already, will be referred to in the
                  subsequent part of this work. </p><p n="326"><pb n="187"/>They have no European fruit, garden stuff, pulse,* or legumes, nor
                  grain of any kind. </p><p n="327">Of tame animals they have only hogs, dogs, and poultry; neither is there a
                  wild animal in the island, except ducks, pigeons, paroquets, with a few other
                  birds, and rats, there being no other quadruped, nor any serpent. But the sea
                  supplies them with great variety of most excellent fish, to eat which is their
                  chief luxury, and to catch it their principal labour. </p><p n="328">As to the people they are of the largest size of Europeans.* The men are
                  tall, strong, well-limbed, and finely shaped. The tallest that we saw was a man
                  upon a neighbouring island, called HUAHEINE, who measured six feet three inches
                  and an half. The women of the superior rank are also in general above our middle
                  stature, but those of the inferior class are rather below it, and some of them are
                  very small. This defect in size probably proceeds from their early commerce with
                  men, the only thing in which they differ from their superiors, that could possibly
                  affect their growth. </p><p n="329">Their natural complexion is that kind of clear olive, or Brunette, which
                  many people in Europe prefer to the finest white and red. In those that are
                  exposed to the wind and sun, it is considerably deepened, but in others that live
                  under shelter, especially the superior class of women, it continues of its native
                  hue, and the skin is most delicately smooth and soft; they have no tint in their
                  cheeks, which we distinguish by the name of colour. The shape of the face is
                  comely, the cheek bones are not high, neither are the eyes hollow, nor the brow
                  prominent: the only feature that does not correspond with our ideas of beauty is
                  the nose, which, in general, is somewhat flat; but their eyes, especially those of
                  the women, are full of expression, sometimes sparkling with <pb n="188"/> fire,*
                  and sometimes melting with softness; their teeth also are, almost without
                  exception, most beautifully even and white, and their breath perfectly without
                  taint. </p><p n="330">The hair is almost universally black, and rather coarse; the men have
                  beards, which they wear in many fashions, always, however, plucking out great part
                  of them, and keeping the rest perfectly clean and neat. Both sexes also eradicate
                  every hair from under their arms, and accused us of great uncleanliness for not
                  doing the same. In their motions there is at once vigour and ease; their walk is
                  graceful, their deportment liberal, and their behaviour to strangers and to each
                  other affable and courteous. In their dispositions also, they seemed to be brave,
                  open, and candid, without either suspicion or treachery, cruelty or revenge; so
                  that we placed the same confidence in them as in our best friends, many of us,
                  particularly Mr. Banks, sleeping frequently in their houses in the woods, without
                  a companion, and consequently wholly in their power. They were, however, all
                  thieves; and when that is allowed, they need not much fear a competition with the
                  people of any other nation upon earth. During our stay in this island we saw about
                  five or six persons, like one that was met by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander on the
                  <date>24th of April</date>, in their walk to the eastward, whose skins were of a dead white,
                  like the nose of a white horse; with white hair, beard, brows, and eye-lashes;
                  red, tender eyes; a short sight, and scurfy skins, covered with a kind of white
                  down; but we found that no two of these belonged to the same family, and therefore
                  concluded, that they were not a species, but unhappy individuals, rendered
                  anomalous by disease. </p><p n="331">*It is a custom in most countries where the inhabitants have long hair,
                  for the men to cut it short and the women to pride <pb n="189"/> themselves in its
                  length. Here, however,* the contrary custom prevails; the women always cut it
                  short round their ears, and the men, except the fishers, who are almost
                  continually in the water, suffer it to flow in large waves over their shoulders,
                  or tie it up in a bunch on the top of their heads. </p><p n="332">They have a custom also of anointing their heads, with what they call
                  Monoe, an oil expressed from the cocoa-nut, in which some sweet herbs or flowers
                  have been infused: as the oil is generally rancid, the smell is at first very
                  disagreeable to a European; and as they live in a hot country, and have no such
                  thing as a comb, they are not able to keep their heads free from lice, which the
                  children and common people sometimes pick out and eat: a hateful custom, wholly
                  different from their manners in every other particular; for they are delicate and
                  cleanly almost without example, and those to whom we distributed combs, soon
                  delivered themselves from vermin, with a diligence which showed that they were not
                  more odious to us than to them. </p><p n="333">They have a custom of staining their bodies, nearly in the same manner as
                  is practised in many other parts of the world, which they call Tattowing. They
                  prick the skin, so as just not to fetch blood, with a small instrument, something
                  in the form of a hoe; that part which answers to the blade is made of a bone or
                  shell, scraped very thin, and is from a quarter of an inch to an inch and a half
                  wide; the edge is cut into sharp teeth or points, from the number of three to
                  twenty, according to its size: when this is to be used, they dip the teeth into a
                  mixture of a kind of lamp-black, formed of the smoke that rises from an oily nut
                  which they burn instead of candles, and water; the teeth, thus prepared, are
                  placed upon the skin, and the handle to which they are fastened <pb n="190"/>
                  being struck,* by quick smart blows, with a stick fitted to the purpose, they
                  pierce it, and at the same time carry into the puncture the black composition,
                  which leaves an indelible stain. The operation is painful, and it is some days
                  before the wounds are healed. It is performed upon the youth of both sexes when
                  they are about twelve or fourteen years of age, on several parts of the body, and
                  in various figures, according to the fancy of the parent, or perhaps the rank of
                  the party. The women are generally marked with this stain, in the form of a Z, on
                  every joint of their fingers and toes, and frequently round the outside of their
                  feet: the men are also marked with the same figure, and both men and women have
                  squares, circles, crescents, and ill-designed representations of men, birds, or
                  dogs, and various other devices impressed upon their legs and arms, some of which
                  we were told had significations, though we could never learn what they were. But
                  the part on which these ornaments are lavished with the greatest profusion, is the
                  breech: this, in both sexes, is covered with a deep black; above which, arches are
                  drawn one over another as high as the short ribs. They are often a quarter of an
                  inch broad, and the edges are not strait lines, but indented. These arches are
                  their pride, and are shewn both by men and women with a mixture of ostentation and
                  pleasure; whether as an ornament, or a proof of their fortitude and resolution in
                  bearing pain, we could not determine. The face in general is left unmarked; for we
                  saw but one instance to the contrary. Some old men had the greatest part of their
                  bodies covered with large patches of black, deeply indented at the edges, like a
                  rude imitation of flame; but we were told, that they came from a low island called
                  NOOUOORA, and were not natives of Otaheite. </p><p n="334">Mr. Banks saw the operation of tattowing performed upon the backside of a
                  girl about thirteen years old. The instrument <!--Page  [unnumbered]--></p><p n="335">[illustration] <pb n="191"/> used upon this occasion had thirty teeth,*
                  and every stroke, of which at least a hundred were made in a minute, drew an ichor
                  or serum a little tinged with blood. The girl bore it with most stoical resolution
                  for about a quarter of an hour; but the pain of so many hundred punctures as she
                  had received in that time then became intolerable: she first complained in
                  murmurs, then wept, and at last burst into loud lamentations, earnestly imploring
                  the operator to desist. He was, however, inexorable; and when she began to
                  struggle, she was held down by two women, who sometimes soothed and sometimes chid
                  her, and now and then, when she was most unruly, gave her a smart blow. Mr. Banks
                  staid in a neighbouring house an hour, and the operation was not over when he went
                  away; yet it was performed but upon one side, the other having been done sometime
                  before; and the arches upon the loins, in which they most pride themselves, and
                  which give more pain than all the rest, were still to be done. It is strange that
                  these people should value themselves upon what is no distinction; for I never saw
                  a native of this island, either man or woman, in a state of maturity, in whom
                  these marks were wanting: possibly they may have their rise in superstition,
                  especially as they produce no visible advantage, and are not made without great
                  pain; but though we enquired of many hundreds, we could never get any account of
                  the matter. </p><p n="336">Their clothing consists of cloth or matting of different kinds, which will
                  be described among their other manufactures. The cloth, which will not bear
                  wetting, they wear in dry weather, and the matting when it rains; they are put on
                  in many different ways, just as their fancy leads them; for in their garments
                  nothing is cut into shape, nor are any <pb n="192"/> two pieces sewed together.*
                  The dress of the better sort of women consists of three or four pieces: one piece,
                  about two yards wide and eleven yards long, they wrap several times round their
                  waist, so as to hang down like a petticoat as low as the middle of the leg, and
                  this they call Parou: two or three other pieces, about two yards and an half long
                  and one wide, each having a hole cut in the middle, they place one upon another,
                  and then putting the head through the holes, they bring the long ends down before
                  and behind; the others remain open at the sides, and give liberty to the arms:
                  this, which they call the Tebuta, is gathered round the waist, and confined with a
                  girdle or sash of thinner cloth, which is long enough to go many times round them,
                  and exactly resembles the garment worn by the inhabitants of Peru and Chili, which
                  the Spaniards call Poncho. The dress of the men is the same, except that instead
                  of suffering the cloth that is wound about the hips to hang down like a petticoat,
                  they bring it between their legs so as to have some resemblance to breeches, and
                  it is then called Maro. This is the dress of all ranks of people, and being
                  universally the same as to form, the gentlemen and ladies distinguish themselves
                  from the lower people by the quantity; some of them will wrap round them several
                  pieces of cloth, eight or ten yards long, and two or three broad; and some throw a
                  large piece loosely over their shoulders in the manner of a cloak, or perhaps two
                  pieces, if they are very great personages, and are desirous to appear in state.
                  The inferior sort, who have only a small allowance of cloth from the tribes or
                  families to which they belong, are obliged to be more thinly clad. In the heat of
                  the day they appear almost naked, the women having only a scanty petticoat, and
                  the men nothing but the sash that is passed between their legs and fastened round
                  the waist. As finery is always troublesome, and particularly in <pb n="193"/> a
                  hot country,* where it consists in putting one covering upon another, the women of
                  rank always uncover themselves as low as the waist in the evening, throwing off
                  all that they wear on the upper part of the body, with the same negligence and
                  ease as our ladies would lay by a cardinal or double handkerchief. And the Chiefs,
                  even when they visited us, though they had as much cloth round their middle as
                  would clothe a dozen people, had frequently the rest of the body quite naked. </p><p n="337">Upon their legs and feet they wear no covering; but they shade their faces
                  from the sun with little bonnets, either of matting or of cocoa-nut leaves, which
                  they make occasionally in a few minutes. This, however, is not all their
                  headdress; the women sometimes wear little turbans, and sometimes a dress which
                  they value much more, and which, indeed, is much more becoming, called Tomou; the
                  Tomou consists of human hair, plaited in threads, scarcely thicker than sewing
                  silk. Mr. Banks has pieces of it above a mile in length, without a knot. These
                  they wind round the head in such a manner as produces a very pretty effect, and in
                  a very great quantity; for I have seen five or six such pieces wound about the
                  head of one woman: among these threads they stick flowers of various kinds,
                  particularly the cape-jessamine, of which they have great plenty, as it is always
                  planted near their houses. The men sometimes stick the tail feather of the
                  Tropic-bird upright in their hair, which, as I have observed before, is often tied
                  in a bunch upon the top of their heads: sometimes they wear a kind of whimsical
                  garland, made of flowers of various kinds, stuck into a piece of the rind of a
                  plantain; or of scarlet peas, stuck with gum upon a piece of wood: and sometimes
                  they wear a kind of wig, made of the hair of men or dogs, or perhaps of cocoa-nut
                  strings, woven upon one thread, which is tied under their <pb n="194"/> hair,* so
                  that these artificial honours of their head may hang down behind. Their personal
                  ornaments, besides flowers, are few; both sexes wear ear-rings, but they are
                  placed only on one side: when we came they consisted of small pieces of shell,
                  stone, berries, red peas, or some small pearls, three in a string; but our beads
                  very soon supplanted them all. </p><p n="338">The children go quite naked; the girls till they are three or four years
                  old, and the boys till they are six or seven. </p><p n="339">The houses,* or rather dwellings of these people have been occasionally
                  mentioned before: they are all built in the wood, between the sea and the
                  mountains, and no more ground is cleared for each house, than just sufficient to
                  prevent the dropping of the branches from rotting the thatch with which they are
                  covered; from the house, therefore, the inhabitant steps immediately under the
                  shade, which is the most delightful that can be imagined. It consists of groves of
                  bread-fruit and cocoa-nuts, without underwood, which are intersected, in all
                  directions, by the paths that lead from one house to the other. Nothing can be
                  more grateful than this shade in so warm a climate, nor any thing more beautiful
                  than these walks. As there is no underwood, the shade cools without impeding the
                  air; and the houses, having no walls, receive the gale from whatever point it
                  blows. I shall now give a particular description of a house of a middling size,
                  from which, as the structure is universally the same, a perfect idea may be formed
                  both of those that are bigger, and those that are less. </p><p n="340">The ground which it covers is an oblong square, four and twenty feet long,
                  and eleven wide; over this a roof is raised, upon three rows of pillars or posts,
                  parallel to each other, one on each side, and the other in the middle. This roof
                  consists of two flat sides inclining to each other, and terminating <pb n="195"/>
                  in a ridge,* exactly like the roofs of our thatched houses in England. The utmost
                  height within is about nine feet, and the eaves on each side reach to within about
                  three feet and an half of the ground: below this, and through the whole height at
                  each end, it is open, no part of it being inclosed with a wall. The roof is
                  thatched with palm-leaves, and the floor is covered, some inches deep, with soft
                  hay; over this are laid mats, so that the whole is one cushion, upon which they
                  sit in the day, and sleep in the night. In some houses, however, there is one
                  stool, which is wholly appropriated to the master of the family; besides this,
                  they have no furniture, except a few little blocks of wood, the upper side of
                  which is hollowed into a curve, and which serve them for pillows. </p><p n="341">The house is indeed principally used as a dormitory; for, except it rains,
                  they eat in the open air, under the shade of the next tree. The clothes that they
                  wear in the day, serve them for covering in the night; the floor is the common bed
                  of the whole household, and is not divided by any partition. The master of the
                  house and his wife sleep in the middle, next to them the married people, next to
                  them the unmarried women, and next to them, at a little distance, the unmarried
                  men; the servants, or Toutous, as they are called, sleep in the open air, except
                  it rains, and in that case they come just within the shed. </p><p n="342">There are, however, houses of another kind, belonging to the Chiefs, in
                  which there is some degree of privacy. These are much smaller, and so constructed
                  as to be carried about in their canoes from place to place, and set up
                  occasionally, like a tent; they are inclosed on the sides with cocoa-nut leaves,
                  but not so close as to exclude the air, and the Chief and his wife sleep in them
                  alone. </p><p n="343"><pb n="196"/>*There are houses also of a much larger size, not built either for
                  the accommodation of a single Chief, or a single family; but as common receptacles
                  for all the people of a district. Some of them are two hundred feet long, thirty
                  broad, and, under the ridge, twenty feet high; these are built and maintained at
                  the common expence of the district, for the accommodation of which they are
                  intended; and have on one side of them a large area, inclosed with low
                  pallisadoes. </p><p n="344">These houses, like those of separate families, have no walls. Privacy,
                  indeed, is little wanted among people who have not even the idea of indecency, and
                  who gratify every appetite and passion before witnesses, with no more sense of
                  impropriety than we feel when we satisfy our hunger at a social board with our
                  family or friends. Those who have no idea of indecency with respect to actions,
                  can have none with respect to words; it is, therefore, scarcely necessary to
                  observe, that, in the conversation of these people, that which is the principal
                  source of their pleasure, is always the principal topic; and that every thing is
                  mentioned without any restraint or emotion, and in the most direct terms, by both
                  sexes. </p><p n="345">*Of the food eaten here the greater part is vegetable. Here are no tame
                  animals except hogs, dogs, and poultry, as I have observed before, and these are
                  by no means plenty. When a Chief kills a hog, it is almost equally divided among
                  his dependants; and as they are very numerous, the share of each individual at
                  these feasts, which are not frequent, must necessarily be small. Dogs and fowls
                  fall somewhat more frequently to the share of the common people. I cannot much
                  commend the flavour of their fowls; but we all agreed, that a South Sea dog was
                  little inferior to an English lamb; <pb n="197"/> their excellence is probably
                  owing to their being kept up,* and fed wholly upon vegetables. The sea affords
                  them a great variety of fish. The smaller fish, when they catch any, are generally
                  eaten raw, as we eat oysters; and nothing that the sea produces comes amiss to
                  them: they are fond of lobsters, crabs, and other shell-fish, which are found upon
                  the coast; and they will eat not only sea-insects, but what the seamen call
                  Blubbers, though some of them are so tough, that they are obliged to suffer them
                  to become putrid before they can be chewed. Of the many vegetables that have been
                  mentioned already as serving them for food, the principal is the bread-fruit, to
                  procure which costs them no trouble or labour but climbing a tree: the tree which
                  produces it, does not indeed shoot up spontaneously; but if a man plants ten of
                  them in his lifetime, which he may do in about an hour, he will as completely
                  fulfil his duty to his own and future generations, as the native of our less
                  temperate climate can do by ploughing in the cold of winter, and reaping in the
                  summer's heat, as often as these seasons return; even if, after he has procured
                  bread for his present household, he should convert a surplus into money, and lay
                  it up for his children. </p><p n="346">It is true, indeed, that the bread-fruit is not always in season; but
                  cocoa-nuts, bananas, plantains, and a great variety of other fruits, supply the
                  deficiency. </p><p n="347">It may well be supposed, that cookery is but little studied by these
                  people as an art; and, indeed, they have but two ways of applying fire to dress
                  their food, broiling and baking; the operation of broiling is so simple that it
                  requires no description, and their baking has been described already, (page 152.)
                  in the account of an entertainment prepared for us by Tupia. Hogs, and large fish,
                  are extremely well dressed in the same manner; and, in our opinion, were more <pb n="198"/> juicy and more equally done than by any art of cookery now practised
                  in Europe.* Bread-fruit is also cooked in an oven of the same kind, which renders
                  it soft, and something like a boiled potatoe; not quite so farinaceous as a good
                  one, but more so than those of the middling sort. </p><p n="348">Of the bread-fruit they also make three dishes, by putting either water or
                  the milk of the cocoa-nut to it, then beating it to a paste with a stone pestle,
                  and afterwards mixing it with ripe plantains, bananas, or the sour paste which
                  they call Mahie. </p><p n="349">The mahie, which has been mentioned as a succedaneum for ripe bread-fruit,
                  before the season for gathering a fresh crop comes on, is thus made: </p><p n="350">The fruit is gathered just before it is perfectly ripe, and being laid in
                  heaps, is closely covered with leaves; in this state it undergoes a fermentation,
                  and becomes disagreeably sweet: the core is then taken out entire, which is done
                  by gently pulling the stalk, and the rest of the fruit is thrown into a hole which
                  is dug for that purpose, generally in the houses, and neatly lined in the bottom
                  and sides with grass; the whole is then covered with leaves, and heavy stones laid
                  upon them: in this state it undergoes a second fermentation, and becomes sour,
                  after which it will suffer no change for many months: it is taken out of the hole
                  as it is wanted for use, and being made into balls, it is wrapped up in leaves and
                  baked; after it is dressed, it will keep five or six weeks. It is eaten both cold
                  and hot, and the natives seldom make a meal without it, though to us the taste was
                  as disagreeable as that of a pickled olive generally is the first time it is
                  eaten. </p><p n="351">As the making of this mahie depends, like brewing, upon fermentation, so,
                  like brewing, it sometimes fails, without <pb n="199"/> their being able to
                  ascertain the cause; it is very natural,* therefore, that the making it should be
                  connected with superstitious notions and ceremonies. It generally falls to the lot
                  of the old women, who will suffer no creature to touch any thing belonging to it,
                  but those whom they employ as assistants, nor even to go into that part of the
                  house where the operation is carrying on. Mr. Banks happened to spoil a large
                  quantity of it only by inadvertently touching a leaf which lay upon it. The old
                  woman, who then presided over these mysteries, told him, that the process would
                  fail; and immediately uncovered the hole in a fit of vexation and despair. Mr.
                  Banks regretted the mischief he had done, but was somewhat consoled by the
                  opportunity which it gave him of examining the preparation, which perhaps, but for
                  such an accident, would never have offered. </p><p n="352">Such is their food, to which salt-water is the universal sauce, no meal
                  being eaten without it: those who live near the sea have it fetched as it is
                  wanted; those who live at some distance keep it in large bamboos, which are set up
                  in their houses, for use. Salt-water, however, is not their only sauce; they make
                  another of the kernels of cocoa-nuts, which being fermented till they dissolve
                  into a paste somewhat resembling butter, are beaten up with salt-water. The
                  flavour of this is very strong, and was, when we first tasted it, exceedingly
                  nauseous; a little use, however, reconciled some of us to it so much, that they
                  preferred it to our own sauces, especially with fish. The natives seemed to
                  consider it as a dainty, and do not use it at their common meals; possibly,
                  because they think it ill management to use cocoa-nuts so lavishly, or perhaps,
                  when we were at the island, they were scarcely ripe enough for the purpose. </p><p n="353">For drink, they have in general nothing but water, or the juice of the
                  cocoa-nut; the art of producing liquors that intoxicate, <pb n="200"/> by
                  fermentation,* being happily unknown among them; neither have they any narcotic
                  which they chew, as the natives of some other countries do opium, beetle-root, and
                  tobacco. Some of them drank freely of our liquors, and in a few instances became
                  very drunk; but the persons to whom this happened were so far from desiring to
                  repeat the debauch, that they would never touch any of our liquors afterwards. We
                  were however informed, that they became drunk by drinking a juice that is
                  expressed from the leaves of a plant which they call Ava Ava. This plant was not
                  in season when we were there, so that we saw no instances of its effects; and as
                  they considered drunkenness as a disgrace, they probably would have concealed from
                  us any instances which might have happened during our stay. This vice is almost
                  peculiar to the Chiefs, and considerable persons, who vie with each other in
                  drinking the greatest number of draughts, each draught being about a pint. They
                  keep this intoxicating juice with great care from their women. </p><p n="354">Table they have none; but their apparatus for eating is set out with great
                  neatness, though the articles are too simple and too few to allow any thing for
                  show: and they commonly eat alone; but when a stranger happens to visit them, he
                  sometimes makes a second in their mess. Of the meal of one of their principal
                  people I shall give a particular description. </p><p n="355">He sits down under the shade of the next tree, or on the shady side of his
                  house, and a large quantity of leaves, either of the bread-fruit or banana, are
                  neatly spread before him upon the ground as a table-cloth; a basket is then set by
                  him that contains his provision, which, if fish or flesh, is ready dressed, and
                  wrapped up in leaves, and two cocoa-nut shells, one full of salt water and the
                  other of fresh: his attendants, which are not few, seat themselves round him, and
                  when all is ready, he begins by washing his hands and his mouth <pb n="201"/>
                  thoroughly with the fresh-water,* and this he repeats almost continually
                  throughout the whole meal; he then takes part of his provision out of the basket,
                  which generally consists of a small fish or two, two or three bread-fruits,
                  fourteen or fifteen ripe bananas, or six or seven apples: he first takes half a
                  bread-fruit, peels off the rind, and takes out the core with his nails; of this he
                  puts as much into his mouth as it can hold, and while he chews it, takes the fish
                  out of the leaves, and breaks one of them into the salt water, placing the other,
                  and what remains of the bread-fruit, upon the leaves that have been spread before
                  him. When this is done, he takes up a small piece of the fish that has been broken
                  into the salt-water, with all the fingers of one hand, and sucks it into his
                  mouth, so as to get with it as much of the salt-water as possible: in the same
                  manner he takes the rest by different morsels, and between each, at least very
                  frequently, takes a small sup of the salt-water, either out of the cocoa-nut
                  shell, or the palm of his hand: in the mean time one of his attendants has
                  prepared a young cocoa-nut, by peeling off the outer rind with his teeth, an
                  operation which to an European appears very surprising; but it depends so much
                  upon slight, that many of us were able to do it before we left the island, and
                  some that could scarcely crack a filbert: the master, when he chuses to drink,
                  takes the cocoa-nut thus prepared, and boring a hole through the shell with his
                  finger, or breaking it with a stone, he sucks out the liquor. When he has eaten
                  his bread-fruit and fish, he begins with his plantains, one of which makes but a
                  mouthful, though it be as big as a black-pudding; if instead of plantains he has
                  apples, he never tastes them till they have been pared; to do this a shell is
                  picked up from the ground, where they are always in plenty, and tossed to him by
                  an attendant: he immediately begins to cut or scrape <pb n="202"/> off the rind,*
                  but so awkwardly that great part of the fruit is wasted. If, instead of fish, he
                  has flesh, he must have some succedaneum for a knife to divide it; and for this
                  purpose a piece of bamboo is tossed to him, of which he makes the necessary
                  implement by splitting it transversely with his nail. While all this has been
                  doing, some of his attendants have been employed in bearing bread-fruit with a
                  stone pestle upon a block of wood; by being beaten in this manner, and sprinkled
                  from time to time with water, it is reduced to the consistence of a soft paste,
                  and is then put into a vessel somewhat like a butcher's tray, and either made up
                  alone, or mixed with banana or mahie, according to the taste of the master, by
                  pouring water upon it by degrees and squeezing it often through the hand: under
                  this operation it acquires the consistence of a thick custard, and a large
                  cocoa-nut shell full of it being set before him, he sips it as we should do a
                  jelly if we had no spoon to take it from the glass: the meal is then finished by
                  again washing his hands and his mouth. After which the cocoa-nut shells are
                  cleaned, and every thing that is left is replaced in the basket. </p><p n="356">The quantity of food which these people eat at a meal is prodigious: I
                  have seen one man devour two or three fishes as big as a perch; three
                  bread-fruits, each bigger than two fists; fourteen or fifteen plantains or
                  bananas, each of them six or seven inches long, and four or five round; and near a
                  quart of the pounded bread-fruit, which is as substantial as the thickest unbaked
                  custard. This is so extraordinary that I scarcely expect to be believed; and I
                  would not have related it upon my own single testimony, but Mr. Banks, Dr.
                  Solander, and most of the other Gentlemen, have had ocular demonstration of its
                  truth, and know that I mention them upon the occasion. </p><p n="357"><pb n="203"/>It is very wonderful, that these people,* who are remarkably fond of
                  society, and particularly that of their women, should exclude its pleasures from
                  the table, where among all other nations, whether civil or savage, they have been
                  principally enjoyed. How a meal, which every where else brings families and
                  friends together, came to separate them here, we often enquired, but could never
                  learn. They eat alone, they said, because it was right; but why it was right to
                  eat alone, they never attempted to tell us: such, however, was the force of habit,
                  that they expressed the strongest dislike, and even disgust, at our eating in
                  society, especially with our women, and of the same victuals. At first, we thought
                  this strange singularity arose from some superstitious opinion; but they
                  constantly affirmed the contrary. We observed also some caprices in the custom,
                  for which we could as little account as for the custom itself. We could never
                  prevail with any of the women to partake of the victuals at our table when we were
                  dining in company; yet they would go, five or six together, into the servants
                  apartments, and there eat very heartily of whatever they could find, of which I
                  have before given a particular instance; nor were they in the least disconcerted
                  if we came in while they were doing it. When any of us have been alone with a
                  woman, she has sometimes eaten in our company; but then she has expressed the
                  greatest unwillingness that it should be known, and always extorted the strongest
                  promises of secrecy. </p><p n="358">Among themselves, even two brothers and two sisters have each their
                  separate baskets, with provision and the apparatus of their meal. When they first
                  visited us at our tents, each brought his basket with him; and when we sat down to
                  table, they would go out, sit down upon the ground, at two or three yards distance
                  from each other, and turning their <pb n="204"/> faces different ways,* take their
                  repast without interchanging a single word. </p><p n="359">The women not only abstain from eating with the men, and of the same
                  victuals, but even have their victuals separately prepared by boys kept for that
                  purpose, who deposit it in a separate shed, and attend them with it at their
                  meals. </p><p n="360">But though they would not eat with us or with each other, they have often
                  asked us to eat with them, when we have visited those with whom we were
                  particularly acquainted at their houses; and we have often upon such occasions
                  eaten out of the same basket, and drunk out of the same cup. The elder women,
                  however, always appeared to be offended at this liberty; and if we happened to
                  touch their victuals, or even the basket that contained it, would throw it away. </p><p n="361">*After meals, and in the heat of the day, the middle-aged people of the
                  better sort generally sleep; they are indeed extremely indolent, and sleeping and
                  eating is almost all that they do. Those that are older are less drowzy, and the
                  boys and girls are kept awake by the natural activity and sprightliness of their
                  age. </p><p n="362">Their amusements have occasionally been mentioned in my account of the
                  incidents that happened during our residence in this island, particularly music,
                  dancing, wrestling, and shooting with the bow; they also sometimes vie with each
                  other in throwing a lance. As shooting is not at a mark, but for distance;
                  throwing the lance is not for distance, but at a mark: the weapon is about nine
                  feet long, the mark is the bole of a plantain, and the distance about twenty
                  yards. </p><p n="363">Their only musical instruments are flutes and drums; the flutes are made
                  of a hollow bamboo about a foot long, and, as has been observed before, have only
                  two stops, and consequently but four notes, out of which they seem hitherto to <pb n="205"/> have formed but one tune;* to these stops they apply the fore finger
                  of the left hand and the middle finger of the right. </p><p n="364">The drum is made of a hollow block of wood, of a cylindrical form, solid
                  at one end, and covered at the other with shark's skin: these they beat not with
                  sticks, but their hands; and they know how to tune two drums of different notes
                  into concord. They have also an expedient to bring the flutes that play together
                  into unison, which is to roll up a leaf so as to slip over the end of the
                  shortest, like our sliding tubes for telescopes, which they move up or down till
                  the purpose is answered, of which they seem to judge by their ear with great
                  nicety. </p><p n="365">To these instruments they sing; and, as I have observed before, their
                  songs are often extempore: they call every two verses or couplet a song, Pehay;
                  they are generally, though not always in rhime; and when pronounced by the
                  natives, we could discover that they were metre. Mr. Banks took great pains to
                  write down some of them which were made upon our arrival, as nearly as he could
                  express their sounds by combinations of our letters; but when we read them, not
                  having their accent, we could scarcely make them either metre or rhime. The Reader
                  will easily perceive that they are of very different structure. </p><p n="366">Tede pahai de parow-a Ha maru no mina. E pahah Tayo malama tai ya No
                  Tabane tonatou whannomi ya. E Turai eattu terara patee whennua toai Ino o maio
                  Pretane to whennuaia no Tute. <pb n="206"/> Of these verses our knowlege of the
                  language is too imperfect to attempt a translation.* They frequently amuse
                  themselves by singing such couplets as these when they are alone, or with their
                  families, especially after it is dark; for though they need no fires, they are not
                  without the comfort of artificial light between sunset and bed-time. Their candles
                  are made of the kernels of a kind of oily nut, which they stick one over another
                  upon a skewer that is thrust through the middle of them; the upper one being
                  lighted, burns down to the second, at the same time consuming that part of the
                  skewer which goes through it; the second taking fire burns in the same manner down
                  to the third, and so of the rest: some of these candles will burn a considerable
                  time, and they give a very tolerable light. They do not often sit up above an hour
                  after it is dark; but when they have strangers who sleep in the house, they
                  generally keep a light burning all night, possibly as a check upon such of the
                  women as they wish not to honour them with their favours. Of their itinerary
                  concerts I need add nothing to what has been said already; especially as I shall
                  have occasion, more particularly, to mention them when I relate our adventures
                  upon another island. </p><p n="367">In other countries, the girls and unmarried women are supposed to be
                  wholly ignorant of what others upon some occasions may appear to know; and their
                  conduct and conversation are consequently restrained within narrower bounds, and
                  kept at a more remote distance from whatever relates to a connection with the
                  other sex: but here, it is just contrary. Among other diversions, there is a
                  dance, called Timorodee, which is performed by young girls, whenever eight or ten
                  of them can be collected together, consisting of motions and gestures beyond
                  imagination wanton, in the practice of which <pb n="207"/> they are brought up
                  from their earliest childhood,* accompanied by words, which, if it were possible,
                  would more explicitly convey the same ideas. In these dances they keep time with
                  an exactness which is scarcely excelled by the best performers upon the stages of
                  Europe. But the practice which is allowed to the virgin, is prohibited to the
                  woman from the moment that she has put these hopeful lessons in practice, and
                  realized the symbols of the dance. </p><p n="368">It cannot be supposed that, among these people, chastity is held in much
                  estimation. It might be expected that sisters and daughters would be offered to
                  strangers, either as a courtesy, or for reward; and that breaches of conjugal
                  fidelity, even in the wife; should not be otherwise punished than by a few hard
                  words, or perhaps a slight beating, as indeed is the case: but there is a scale in
                  dissolute sensuality, which these people have ascended, wholly unknown to every
                  other nation whose manners have been recorded from the beginning of the world to
                  the present hour, and which no imagination could possibly conceive. </p><p n="369">A very considerable number of the principal people of Otaheite, of both
                  sexes, have formed themselves into a society, in which every woman is common to
                  every man; thus securing a perpetual variety as often as their inclination prompts
                  them to seek it, which is so frequent, that the same man and woman seldom cohabit
                  together more than two or three days. </p><p n="370">These societies are distinguished by the name of Arreoy; and the members
                  have meetings, at which no other is present, where the men amuse themselves by
                  wrestling, and the women, notwithstanding their occasional connection with
                  different men, dance the Timorodee in all its latitude, as an incitement to
                  desires which it is said are frequently gratified <pb n="208"/> upon the spot.*
                  This however is comparatively nothing. If any of the women happen to be with
                  child, which in this manner of life happens less frequently than if they were to
                  cohabit only with one man, the poor infant is smothered the moment it is born,
                  that it may be no incumbrance to the father, nor interrupt the mother in the
                  pleasures of her diabolical prostitution. It sometimes indeed happens, that the
                  passion which prompts a woman to enter into this society, is surmounted when she
                  becomes a mother, by that instinctive affection which Nature has given to all
                  creatures for the preservation of their offspring; but even in this case, she is
                  not permitted to spare the life of her infant, except she can find a man who will
                  patronise it as his child: if this can be done, the murder is prevented; but both
                  the man and woman, being deemed by this act to have appropriated each other, are
                  ejected from the community, and forfeit all claim to the privileges and pleasures
                  of Arreoy for the future; the woman from that time being distinguished by the term
                  Whannownow, "bearer of children," which is here a term of reproach; though none
                  can be more honourable in the estimation of wisdom and humanity, of right reason,
                  and every passion that distinguishes the man from the brute. </p><p n="371">It is not fit that a practice so horrid and so strange should be imputed
                  to human beings upon slight evidence, but I have such as abundantly justifies me
                  in the account I have given. The people themselves are so far from concealing
                  their connection with such a society as a disgrace, that they boast of it as a
                  privilege; and both myself and Mr. Banks, when particular persons have been
                  pointed out to us as members of the Arreoy, have questioned them about it, and
                  received the account that has been here given from their own lips. They have
                  acknowledged, that they had long been of <pb n="209"/> this accursed society, that
                  they belonged to it at that time,* and that several of their children had been put
                  to death. </p><p n="372">But I must not conclude my account of the domestic life of these people
                  without mentioning their personal cleanliness. If that which lessens the good of
                  life and increases the evil is vice, surely cleanliness is a virtue: the want of
                  it tends to destroy both beauty and health, and mingles disgust with our best
                  pleasures. The natives of Otaheite, both men and women, constantly wash their
                  whole bodies in running water three times every day; once as soon as they rise in
                  the morning, once at noon, and again before they sleep at night, whether the sea
                  or river is near them or at a distance. I have already observed, that they wash
                  not only the mouth, but the hands at their meals, almost between every morsel; and
                  their clothes, as well as their persons, are kept without spot or stain; so that
                  in a large company of these people, nothing is suffered but heat, which, perhaps,
                  is more than can be said of the politest assembly in Europe. </p></div><pb n="210"/><div type="chapter" n="18"><head><l>CHAP.XVIII.</l><l><emph rend="italic"> Of the Manufactures, Boats, and Navigation of

                  been much exerted where the liberality of Nature has rendered the diligence of Art
                  almost superfluous; yet there are many instances both of ingenuity and labour
                  among these people, which, considering the want of metal for tools, do honour to
                  both. </p><p n="374">*Their principal manufacture is their cloth, in the making and dying of
                  which I think there are some particulars which may instruct even the artificers of
                  Great Britain, and for that reason my description will be more minute. </p><p n="375">Their cloth is of three kinds; and it is made of the bark of three
                  different trees, the Chinese paper mulberry, the bread-fruit tree, and the tree
                  which resembles the wild fig-tree of the West Indies. </p><p n="376">The finest and whitest is made of the paper mulberry, Aouta; this is worn
                  chiefly by the principal people, and when it is dyed red takes a better colour. A
                  second sort, inferior in whiteness and softness, is made of the bread-fruit tree,
                  Ooroo, and worn chiefly by the inferior people; and a third of the tree that
                  resembles the fig, which is coarse and harsh, and of the colour of the darkest
                  brown paper: this, though it is less pleasing both to the eye and the touch, is
                  the most valuable, because it resists water, which the other two sorts will not.
                  Of this, which is the most rare as well as the most <pb n="211"/> useful, the
                  greater part is perfumed,* and worn by the Chiefs as a morning dress. </p><p n="377">All these trees are propagated with great care, particularly the mulberry,
                  which covers the largest part of the cultivated land, and is not fit for use after
                  two or three year's growth, when it is about six or eight feet high, and somewhat
                  thicker than a man's thumb; its excellence is to be thin, strait, tall, and
                  without branches: the lower leaves, therefore, are carefully plucked off, with
                  their germs, as often as there is any appearance of their producing a branch. </p><p n="378">But though the cloth made of these three trees is different, it is all
                  manufactured in the same manner; I shall, therefore, describe the process only in
                  the fine sort, that is made of the mulberry. When the trees are of a proper size,
                  they are drawn up, and stripped of their branches, after which the roots and tops
                  are cut off; the bark of these rods being then slit up longitudinally is easily
                  drawn off, and, when a proper quantity has been procured, it is carried down to
                  some running water, in which it is deposited to soak, and secured from floating
                  away by heavy stones: when it is supposed to be sufficiently softened, the women
                  servants go down to the brook, and stripping themselves, sit down in the water, to
                  separate the inner bark from the green part on the outside; to do this they place
                  the under side upon a flat smooth board, and with the shell which our dealers call
                  Tyger's tongue, Tellina gargadia, scrape it very carefully, dipping it continually
                  in the water till nothing remains but the fine fibres of the inner coat. Being
                  thus prepared in the afternoon, they are spread out upon plantain leaves in the
                  evening; and in this part of the work there appears to be some difficulty, as the
                  mistress of the family always superintends the doing <pb n="212"/> of it:* they
                  are placed in lengths of about eleven or twelve yards, one by the side of another,
                  till they are about a foot broad, and two or three layers are also laid one upon
                  the other: care is taken that the cloth shall be in all parts of an equal
                  thickness, so that if the bark happens to be thinner in any particular part of one
                  layer than the rest, a piece that is somewhat thicker is picked out to be laid
                  over it in the next. In this state it remains till the morning, when great part of
                  the water which it contained when it was laid out, is either drained off or
                  evaporated, and the several fibres adhere together, so as that the whole may be
                  raised from the ground in one piece. </p><p n="379">It is then taken away, and laid upon the smooth side of a long piece of
                  wood, prepared for the purpose, and beaten by the women servants, with instruments
                  about a foot long and three inches thick, made of a hard wood which they call
                  Etoa. The shape of this instrument is not unlike a square razor strop, only that
                  the handle is longer, and each of its four sides or faces is marked, lengthways,
                  with small grooves, or furrows, of different degrees of fineness; those on one
                  side being of a width and depth sufficient to receive a small packthread, and the
                  others finer in a regular gradation, so that the last are not more than equal to
                  sewing silk. </p><p n="380">They beat it first with the coarsest side of this mallet, keeping time
                  like our smiths; it spreads very fast under the strokes, chiefly however in the
                  breadth, and the grooves in the mallet mark it with the appearance of threads; it
                  is successively beaten with the other sides, last with the finest, and is then fit
                  for use. Sometimes, however, it is made still thinner, by beating it with the
                  finest side of the mallet, after it has been several times doubled: it is then
                  called Hoboo, and is almost as thin as a muslin; it becomes very white by being
                  <!--Page  [unnumbered]--></p><p n="381">[illustration] <pb n="213"/> bleached in the air,* but is made still
                  whiter and softer by being washed and beaten again after it has been worn. Of this
                  cloth there are several sorts, of different degrees of fineness, in proportion as
                  it is more or less beaten without being doubled: the other cloth also differs in
                  proportion as it is beaten; but they differ from each other in consequence of the
                  different materials of which they are made. The bark of the bread-fruit is not
                  taken till the trees are considerably longer and thicker than those of the fig;
                  the process afterwards is the same. </p><p n="382">When cloth is to be washed after it has been worn, it is taken down to the
                  brook, and left to soak, being kept fast to the bottom, as at first, by a stone;
                  it is then gently wrung or squeezed; and sometimes several pieces of it are laid
                  one upon another, and beaten together with the coarsest side of the mallet, and
                  they are then equal in thickness to broad-cloth, and much more soft and agreeable
                  to the touch, after they have been a little while in use, though, when they come
                  immediately from the mallet, they feel as if they had been starched. This cloth
                  sometimes breaks in the beating, but is easily repaired by pasting on a patch with
                  a gluten that is prepared from the root of the Pea, which is done so nicely that
                  it cannot be discovered. The women also employ themselves in removing blemishes of
                  every kind, as our ladies do in needle-work or knotting; sometimes when their work
                  is intended to be very fine, they will paste an entire covering of hoboo over the
                  whole. The principal excellencies of this cloth are its coolness and softness; and
                  its imperfections, its being pervious to water like paper, and almost as easily
                  torn. </p><p n="383">The colours with which they die this cloth are principally red and yellow.
                  The red is exceedingly beautiful, and I may venture to say, a brighter and more
                  delicate colour than <pb n="214"/> any we have in Europe;* that which approaches
                  nearest is our full scarlet, and the best imitation which Mr. Banks's natural
                  history painter could produce, was by a mixture of vermilion and carmine. The
                  yellow is also a bright colour, but we have many as good. </p><p n="384">The red colour is produced by the mixture of the juices of two vegetables,
                  neither of which separately has the least tendency to that hue. One is a species
                  of fig, called here Matte, and the other the Cordia Sebestina, or Etou; of the fig
                  the fruit is used, and of the Cordia the leaves. </p><p n="385">The fruit of the fig is about as big as a rounceval pea, or very small
                  gooseberry; and each of them, upon breaking off the stalk very close, produces one
                  drop of a milky liquor, resembling the juice of our figs, of which the tree is
                  indeed a species. This liquor the women collect into a small quantity of cocoa-nut
                  water: to prepare a gill of cocoa-nut water will require between three and four
                  quarts of these little figs. When a sufficient quantity is prepared, the leaves of
                  the Etou are well wetted in it, and then laid upon a plantain leaf, where they are
                  turned about till they become more and more flaccid, and then they are gently
                  squeezed, gradually increasing the pressure, but so as not to break them; as the
                  flaccidity increases, and they become spungy, they are supplied with more of the
                  liquor; in about five minutes the colour begins to appear upon the veins of the
                  leaves, and in about ten or a little more, they are perfectly saturated with it:
                  they are then squeezed, with as much force as can be applied, and the liquor
                  strained at the same time that it is expressed. </p><p n="386">For this purpose, the boys prepare a large quantity of the Moo, by drawing
                  it between their teeth, or two little sticks, till it is freed from the green bark
                  and the branny substance <pb n="215"/> that lies under it, and a thin web of the
                  fibres only remains;* in this the leaves of the Etou are inveloped, and through
                  these the juice which they contain is strained as it is forced out. As the leaves
                  are not succulent, little more juice is pressed out of them than they have
                  imbibed: when they have been once emptied, they are filled again, and again
                  pressed till the quality which tinctures the liquor as it passes through them is
                  exhausted, they are then thrown away; but the Moo, being deeply stained with the
                  colour, is preserved, as a brush to lay the dye upon the cloth. </p><p n="387">The expressed liquor is always received into small cups made of the
                  plantain leaf, whether from a notion that it has any quality favourable to the
                  colour, or from the facility with which it is procured, and the convenience of
                  small vessels to distribute it among the artificers, I do not know. </p><p n="388">Of the thin cloth they seldom dye more than the edges, but the thick cloth
                  is coloured through the whole surface; the liquor is indeed used rather as a
                  pigment than a dye, for a coat of it is laid upon one side only, with the fibres
                  of the Moo; and though I have seen of the thin cloth that has appeared to have
                  been soaked in the liquor, the colour has not had the same richness and lustre, as
                  when it has been applied in the other manner. </p><p n="389">Though the leaf of the Etou is generally used in this process, and
                  probably produces the finest colour; yet the juice of the figs will produce a red
                  by a mixture with the species of Tournefortia, which they call Taheinoo, the
                  Pohuc, the Eurhe or Convolvulus Brasiliensis, and a species of Solanum called
                  Ebooa; from the use of these different plants, or from different proportions of
                  the materials, many varieties are obobservable in the colours of their cloth, some
                  of which are conspicuously superior to others. </p><p n="390"><pb n="216"/>*The beauty, however, of the best is not permanent; but it is
                  probable that some method might be found to fix it, if proper experiments were
                  made, and perhaps to search for latent qualities, which may be brought out by the
                  mixture of one vegetable juice with another, would not be an unprofitable
                  employment: our present most valuable dyes afford sufficient encouragement to the
                  attempt; for by the mere inspection of indico, woad, dyer's weed, and most of the
                  leaves which are used for the like purposes, the colours which they yield could
                  never be discovered. Of this Indian red I shall only add, that the women who have
                  been employed in preparing or using it, carefully preserve the colour upon their
                  fingers and nails, where it appears in its utmost beauty, as a great ornament. </p><p n="391">The yellow is made of the bark of the root of the Morinda citrifolia,
                  called Nono, by scraping and infusing it in water; after standing some time, the
                  water is strained and used as a dye, the cloth being dipped into it. The Morinda,
                  of which this is a species, seems to be a good subject for examination with a view
                  to dyeing. Brown, in his history of Jamaica, mentions three species of it, which
                  he says are used to dye brown; and Rumphius says of the Bancuda Augustifolia,
                  which is nearly allied to our Nono, that it is used by the inhabitants of the
                  East-Indian islands, as a fixing drug for red colours, with which it particularly
                  agrees. </p><p n="392">The inhabitants of this island also dye yellow with the fruit of the
                  Tamanu; but how the colour is extracted, we had no opportunity to discover. They
                  have also a preparation with which they die brown and black; but these colours are
                  so indifferent, that the method of preparing them did not excite our curiosity. </p><p n="393"><pb n="217"/>Another considerable manufacture is matting of various kinds; some of
                  which is finer, and better in every respect,* than any we have in Europe: the
                  coarser sort serves them to sleep upon, and the finer to wear in wet weather. With
                  the fine, of which there are also two sorts, much pains is taken, especially with
                  that made of the bark of the Poerou, the Hibiscus tiliaceus of Linnaeus, some of
                  which is as fine as a coarse cloth: the other sort, which is still more beautiful,
                  they call Vanne; it is white, glossy, and shining, and is made of the leaves of
                  their Wharrou, a species of the Pandanus, of which we had no opportunity to see
                  either the flowers or fruit: they have other matts, or as they call them Moeas, to
                  sit or to sleep upon, which are formed of a great variety of rushes and grass, and
                  which they make, as they do every thing else that is plaited, with amazing
                  facility and dispatch. </p><p n="394">They are also very dexterous in making basket and wickerwork; their
                  baskets are of a thousand different patterns, many of them exceedingly neat; and
                  the making them is an art that every one practises, both men and women: they make
                  occasional baskets and panniers of the cocoa-nut leaf in a few minutes, and the
                  women who visited us early in a morning used to send, as soon as the sun was high,
                  for a few of the leaves, of which they made little bonnets to shade their faces,
                  at so small an expence of time and trouble, that, when the sun was again low in
                  the evening, they used to throw them away. These bonnets, however, did not cover
                  the head, but consisted only of a band that went round it, and a shade that
                  projected from the forehead. </p><p n="395">Of the bark of the Poerou they make ropes and lines, from the thickness of
                  an inch to the size of a small packthread: <pb n="218"/> with these they make nets
                  for fishing:* of the fibres of the cocoa-nut they make thread, for fastening
                  together the several parts of their canoes, and belts, either round or flat,
                  twisted or plaited; and of the bark of the Erowa, a kind of nettle which grows in
                  the mountains, and is therefore rather scarce, they make the best fishing lines in
                  the world: with these they hold the strongest and most active fish, such as
                  Bonetas and Albicores, which would snap our strongest silk lines in a minute,
                  though they are twice as thick. </p><p n="396">They make also a kind of seine, of a coarse broad grass, the blades of
                  which are like flags: these they twist and tie together in a loose manner, till
                  the net, which is about as wide as a large sack, is from sixty to eighty fathom
                  long: this they haul in shoal smooth water, and its own weight keeps it so close
                  to the ground that scarcely a single fish can escape. </p><p n="397">In every expedient, indeed, for taking fish, they are exceedingly
                  ingenious; they make harpoons of cane, and point them with hard wood, which in
                  their hands strike fish more effectually, than those which are headed with iron
                  can do in ours, setting aside the advantage of ours being fastened to a line, so
                  that the fish is secured if the hook takes place, though it does not mortally
                  wound him. </p><p n="398">Of fish-hooks they have two sorts, admirably adapted in their construction
                  as well to the purpose they are to answer, as to the materials of which they are
                  made. One of these, which they call Wittee Wittee, is used for towing. The shank
                  is made of mother of pearl, the most glossy that can be got: the inside, which is
                  naturally the brightest, is put behind. To these hooks a tuft of white dog's or
                  hog's hair is fixed, so as somewhat to resemble the tail of a fish; these
                  implements, therefore, <pb n="219"/> are both hook and bait,* and are used with a
                  rod of bamboo, and line of Erowa. The fisher, to secure his success, watches the
                  flight of the birds which constantly attend the Bonetas when they swim in shoals,
                  by which he directs his canoe, and when he has the advantage of these guides, he
                  seldom returns without a prize. </p><p n="399">The other kind of hook is also made of mother of pearl, or some other hard
                  shell: they cannot make them bearded like our hooks; but to effect the same
                  purpose, they make the point turn inwards. These are made of all sizes, and used
                  to catch various kinds of fish, with great success. The manner of making them is
                  very simple, and every fisherman is his own artificer: the shell is first cut into
                  square pieces, by the edge of another shell, and wrought into a form corresponding
                  with the outline of the hook by pieces of coral, which are sufficiently rough to
                  perform the office of a file; a hole is then bored in the middle, the drill being
                  no other than the first stone they pick up that has a sharp corner: this they fix
                  into the end of a piece of bamboo, and turn it between the hands like a chocolate
                  mill; when the shell is perforated, and the hole sufficiently wide, a small file
                  of coral is introduced, by the application of which the hook is in a short time
                  completed, few costing the artificer more time than a quarter of an hour. </p><p n="400">Of their masonry, carving, and architecture, the Reader has already formed
                  some idea from the account that has been given of the Morais, or repositories of
                  the dead: the other most important article of building and carving is their
                  boats;* and perhaps, to fabricate one of their principal vessels with their tools,
                  is as great a work, as to build a British man of war with ours. </p><p n="401"><pb n="220"/>*They have an adze of stone; a chissel, or gouge, of bone, generally
                  that of a man's arm between the wrist and elbow; a rasp of coral; and the skin of
                  a sting-ray, with coral sand, as a file or polisher. </p><p n="402">This is a complete catalogue of their tools, and with these they build
                  houses, construct canoes, hew stone, and fell, cleave, carve, and polish timber. </p><p n="403">The stone which makes the blade of their adzes is a kind of Basaltes, of a
                  blackish or grey colour, not very hard, but of considerable toughness: they are
                  formed of different sizes; some, that are intended for felling, weigh from six to
                  eight pounds; others, that are used for carving, not more than so many ounces; but
                  it is necessary to sharpen both almost every minute; for which purpose, a stone
                  and a cocoa-nut shell full of water are always at hand. </p><p n="404">Their greatest exploit, to which these tools are less equal than to any
                  other, is felling a tree: this requires many hands, and the constant labour of
                  several days. When it is down, they split it, with the grain, into planks from
                  three to four inches thick, the whole length and breadth of the tree, many of
                  which are eight feet in the girt, and forty to the branches, and nearly of the
                  same thickness throughout. The tree generally used is in their language called
                  Avie, the stem of which is tall and strait; though some of the smaller boats are
                  made of the bread-fruit tree, which is a light spongy wood, and easily wrought.
                  They smooth the plank very expeditiously and dexterously with their adzes, and can
                  take off a thin coat from a whole plank without missing a stroke. As they have not
                  the art of warping a plank, every part of the canoe, whether hollow or flat, is
                  shaped by hand. </p><p n="405"><pb n="221"/>The canoes, or boats,* which are used by the inhabitants of this and
                  the neighbouring islands, may be divided into two general classes; one of which
                  they call Ivahahs, the other Pahies. </p><p n="406">The Ivahah is used for short excursions to sea, and is wall-sided and
                  flat-bottomed; the Pahie for longer voyages, and is bow-sided and sharp-bottomed.
                  The Ivahahs are all of the same figure, but of different sizes, and used for
                  different purposes: their length is from seventy-two feet to ten, but the breadth
                  is by no means in proportion; for those of ten feet are about a foot wide, and
                  those of more than seventy are scarcely two. There is the fighting Ivahah, the
                  fishing Ivahah, and the travelling Ivahah; for some of these go from one island to
                  another. The fighting Ivahah is by far the longest, and the head and stern are
                  considerably raised above the body, in a semicircular form; particularly the
                  stern, which is sometimes seventeen or eighteen feet high, though the boat itself
                  is scarcely three. These never go to sea single; but are fastened together, side
                  by side, at the distance of about three feet, by strong poles of wood, which are
                  laid across them and lashed to the gunwales. Upon these, in the forepart, a stage
                  or platform is raised, about ten or twelve feet long, and somewhat wider than the
                  boats, which is supported by pillars about six feet high: upon this stage stand
                  the fighting men, whose missile weapons are slings and spears; for, among other
                  singularities in the manners of these people, their bows and arrows are used only
                  for diversion, as we throw quoits: below these stages sit the rowers, who receive
                  from them those that are wounded, and furnish fresh men to ascend in their room.
                  Some of these have a platform of bamboos or other light wood, through their whole
                  length, and considerably broader, by means of which they will carry <pb n="222"/>
                  a great number of men;* but we saw only one fitted in this manner. </p><p n="407">The fishing Ivahahs vary in length from about forty feet to the smallest
                  size, which is about ten; all that are of the length of twenty-five feet and
                  upwards, of whatever sort, occasionally carry sail. The travelling Ivahah is
                  always double, and furnished with a small neat house about five or six feet broad,
                  and six or seven feet long, which is fastened upon the fore-part for the
                  convenience of the principal people, who sit in them by day, and sleep in them at
                  night. The fishing Ivahahs are sometimes joined together, and have a house on
                  board; but this is not common. </p><p n="408">Those which are shorter than five and twenty feet, seldom or never carry
                  sail; and, though the stern rises about four or five feet, have a flat head, and a
                  board that projects forward about four feet. </p><p n="409">The Pahie is also of different sizes, from sixty to thirty feet long; but,
                  like the Ivahah, is very narrow. One that I measured was fifty-one feet long, and
                  only one foot and a half wide at the top. In the widest part, it was about three
                  feet; and this is the general proportion. It does not, however, widen by a gradual
                  swell; but the sides being strait, and parallel, for a little way below the
                  gunwale, it swells abruptly, and draws to a ridge at the bottom; so that a
                  transverse section of it has somewhat the appearance of the mark upon cards called
                  a Spade, the whole being much wider in proportion to its length. These, like the
                  largest Ivahahs, are used for fighting; but principally for long voyages. The
                  fighting Pahie, which is the largest, is fitted with the stage or platform, which
                  is proportionably larger than those of the Ivahah, as their form enables them to
                  sustain a much greater weight. Those that are used for sailing are generally
                  double; and the middle <pb n="223"/> size are said to be the best sea-boats.* They
                  are sometimes out a month together, going from island to island; and sometimes, as
                  we were credibly informed, they are a fortnight or twenty days at sea, and could
                  keep it longer if they had more stowage for provisions, and conveniencies to hold
                  fresh water. </p><p n="410">When any of these boats carry sail single, they make use of a log of wood
                  which is fastened to the end of two poles that lie cross the vessel, and project
                  from six to ten feet, according to the size of the vessel, beyond its side,
                  somewhat like what is used by the flying Proa of the Ladrone Islands, and called
                  in the Account of Lord Anson's Voyage, an Outrigger. To this outrigger the shrouds
                  are fastened, and it is essentially necessary in trimming the boat when it blows
                  fresh. </p><p n="411">Some of them have one mast, and some two; they are made of a single stick,
                  and when the length of the canoe is thirty feet, that of the mast is somewhat less
                  than five and twenty; it is fixed to a frame that is above the canoe, and receives
                  a sail of matting about one third longer than itself: the sail is pointed at the
                  top, square at the bottom, and curved at the side; somewhat resembling what we
                  call a shoulder of mutton sail, and use for boats belonging to men of war: it is
                  placed in a frame of wood, which surrounds it on every side, and has no
                  contrivance either for reefing or furling; so that, if either should become
                  necessary, it must be cut away, which, however, in these equal climates can seldom
                  happen. At the top of the mast are fastened ornaments of feathers, which are
                  placed inclining obliquely forwards; the shape and position of which will be
                  conceived at once from the figure, in one of the cuts. </p><p n="412"><pb n="224"/>*The oars or paddles that are used with these boats, have a long
                  handle and a flat blade, not unlike a baker's peel. Of these every person in the
                  boat has one, except those that sit under the awning; and they push her forward
                  with them at a good rate. These boats, however, admit so much water at the seams,
                  that one person at least is continually employed in throwing it out. The only
                  thing in which they excel is landing, and putting off from the shore in a surf: by
                  their great length and high sterns they land dry, when our boats could scarcely
                  land at all; and have the same advantages in putting off by the height of the
                  head. </p><p n="413">The Ivahahs are the only boats that are used by the inhabitants of
                  Otaheite; but we saw several Pahies that came from other islands. Of one of these
                  I shall give the exact dimensions from a careful admeasurement, and then
                  particularly describe the manner in which they are built. </p><p n="414"> Feet. Inches. Extreme length from stem to stern, not reckoning the

                  illustrate my description of the manner in which these vessels are built,* it will
                  be necessary [illustration] to refer to the figure; in which a a is the first
                  seam, b b the second, and c c the third. The first stage or keel, under a a, is
                  made of a tree hollowed out like a trough; for which the longest trees are chosen
                  that can be got, so that there are never more than three in the whole length: the
                  next stage, under b b, is formed of strait plank, about four feet long, fifteen
                  inches broad, and two inches thick: the third stage, under c c, is, like the
                  bottom made of trunks, hollowed into its bilging form; the last is also cut out of
                  trunks, so that the moulding is of one piece with the upright. To form these parts
                  separately, without saw, plane, chissel, or any other iron tool, may well be
                  thought no easy task; but the great difficulty is to join them together. </p><p n="415">When all the parts are prepared, the keel is laid upon blocks, and the
                  planks being supported by stanchions, are sewed or clamped together with strong
                  thongs of plaiting, which are passed several times through holes that are bored
                  with a gouge or auger of bone, that has been described already; and the nicety
                  with which this is done, may be inferred from their being sufficiently water-tight
                  for use without caulking. As the plaiting soon rots in the water, it is renewed at
                  least once a-year; in order to which, the vessel is taken entirely to pieces. The
                  head and stern are rude with respect to the design; but very neatly finished, and
                  polished to the highest degree. </p><p n="416">These Pahies are kept with great care, in a kind of house built on purpose
                  for their reception; the houses are formed of poles set upright in the ground, the
                  tops of which <pb n="226"/> are drawn towards each other,* and fastened together
                  with their strongest cord, so as to form a kind of Gothic arch, which is
                  completely thatched quite to the ground, being open only at the ends; they are
                  sometimes fifty or sixty paces long. </p><p n="417">As connected with the navigation of these people, I shall mention their
                  wonderful sagacity in foretelling the weather, at least the quarter from which the
                  wind shall blow at a future time; they have several ways of doing this, of which
                  however I know but one. They say, that the Milky-way is always curved laterally;
                  but sometimes in one direction, and sometimes in another: and that this curvature
                  is the effect of its being already acted upon by the wind, and its hollow part
                  therefore towards it; so that, if the same curvature continues a night, a
                  corresponding wind certainly blows the next day. Of their rules, I shall not
                  pretend to judge; but I know that, by whatever means, they can predict the
                  weather, at least the wind, with much greater certainty than we can. </p><p n="418">In their longer voyages, they steer by the sun in the day, and in the
                  night by the stars; all of which they distinguish separately by names, and know in
                  what part of the heavens they will appear in any of the months during which they
                  are visible in their horizon; they also know the time of their annual appearing
                  and disappearing with more precision than will easily be believed by an European
                  astronomer. </p></div><pb n="227"/><div type="chapter" n="19"><head><l>CHAP.XIX.</l><l><emph rend="italic"> Of the Division of Time in Otaheite; Numeration,

                        future Navigators.</emph></l></head><p n="419">WE were not able to acquire a perfect idea of their method of dividing
                  time; but observed,* that in speaking of it, either past or to come, they never
                  used any term but Malama, which signifies Moon. Of these moons they count
                  thirteen, and then begin again; which is a demonstration that they have a notion
                  of the solar year: but how they compute their months so that thirteen of them
                  shall be commensurate with the year, we could not discover; for they say that each
                  month has twenty-nine days, including one in which the moon is not visible. They
                  have names for them separately, and have frequently told us the fruits that would
                  be in season, and the weather that would prevail, in each of them; and they have
                  indeed a name for them collectively, though they use it only when they speak of
                  the mysteries of their religion. </p><p n="420">Every day is subdivided into twelve parts, each of two hours, of which six
                  belong to the day, and six to the night. At these divisions they guess pretty
                  nearly by the height of the sun while he is above the horizon; but there are few
                  of them that can guess at them, when he is below it, by the stars. </p><p n="421"><pb n="228"/>*In numeration they proceed from one to ten, the number of fingers on
                  both hands; and though they have for each number a different name, they generally
                  take hold of their fingers one by one, shifting from one hand to the other till
                  they come to the number they want to express. And in other instances, we observed
                  that, when they were conversing with each other, they joined signs to their words,
                  which were so expressive that a stranger might easily apprehend their meaning. </p><p n="422">In counting from ten they repeat the name of that number, and add the word
                  more; ten, and one more, is eleven; ten, and two more, twelve; and so of the rest,
                  as we say one and twenty, two and twenty. When they come to ten and ten more, they
                  have a new denomination, as we say a score; and by these scores they count till
                  they get ten of them, when they have a denomination for two hundred; and we never
                  could discover that they had any denomination to express a greater number:
                  neither, indeed, do they seem to want any; for ten of these amount to two
                  thousand, a greater number than they can ever apply. </p><p n="423">In measuring distance they are much more deficient than in computing
                  numbers, having but one term which answers to fathom; when they speak of distances
                  from place to place, they express it, like the Asiatics, by the time that is
                  required to pass it. </p><p n="424">*Their language is soft and melodious; it abounds with vowels, and we
                  easily learnt to pronounce it: but found it exceedingly difficult to teach them to
                  pronounce a single word of ours; probably not only from its abounding in
                  consonants, but from some peculiarity in its structure; for Spanish and Italian
                  words, if ending in a vowel, they pronounced with great facility. </p><p n="425"><pb n="229"/>Whether it is copious,* we were not sufficiently acquainted with it
                  to know; but it is certainly very imperfect, for it is almost totally without
                  inflexion, both of nouns and verbs. Few of the nouns have more than one case, and
                  few of the verbs more than one tense; yet we found no great difficulty in making
                  ourselves mutually understood, however strange it may appear in speculation. </p><p n="426">They have, however, certain affixa, which, though but few in number, are
                  very useful to them, and puzzled us extremely. One asks another, Harre hea? </p><p n="427">Where are you going? the other answers Ivahinera, To my wives; upon which
                  the first repeating the answer interrogatively, To your wives? is answered,
                  Ivahinereira; Yes, I am going to my wives. Here the suffixa era and eira save
                  several words to both parties. I have inserted a few of their words, from which
                  perhaps some idea may be formed of the language. </p><p n="428">Pupo, the head. Ahewh, the nose. Roourou, the hair. Outou, the mouth.

                  drunk, it is scarcely necessary to say, that there are but few diseases; we saw no
                  critical disease during our stay upon the island, and but few instances of
                  sickness, which were accidental fits of the colic. The natives, however, are
                  afflicted with the erysipelas, and cutaneous eruptions of the scaly kind, very
                  nearly approaching to a leprosy. Those in whom this distemper was far advanced,
                  lived in a state of seclusion from all society, each in a small house built upon
                  some unfrequented spot, where they were supplied with provisions: but whether they
                  had any hope of relief, or languished out the remainder of their lives in solitude
                  and despair, we could not learn. We observed also a few who had ulcers upon
                  different parts of their bodies, some of which had a very virulent appearance; yet
                  they seemed not much to be regarded by those who were afflicted with them, for
                  they were left intirely without application even to keep off the flies. </p><p n="429">Where intemperance produces no diseases, there will be no physicians by
                  profession; yet where there is sufferance, there will always be attempts to
                  relieve; and where the cause of the mischief and the remedy are alike unknown,
                  these will naturally be directed by superstition: thus it happens, that in this
                  country, and in all others which are not further injured by luxury, or improved by
                  knowlege, the management of the sick falls to the lot of the priest. The method of
                  cure that is practised by the priests of Otaheite, consists chiefly of prayers and
                  ceremonies. When he visits his patient he repeats certain sentences, which appear
                  to be set forms contrived for the occasion, and at the same time plaits the leaves
                  of the cocoa-nut into different figures very neatly; some of these he fastens to
                  the fingers and toes of the sick, <pb n="232"/> and often leaves behind him a few
                  branches of the thespecia populnea,* which they call E'midho: these ceremonies are
                  repeated till the patient recovers or dies. If he recovers, they say the remedies
                  cured him, if he dies, they say the disease was incurable, in which perhaps they
                  do not much differ from the custom of other countries. </p><p n="430">If we had judged of their skill in surgery from the dreadful scars which
                  we sometimes saw, we should have supposed it to be much superior to the art not
                  only of their physicians, but of ours. We saw one man whose face was almost
                  intirely destroyed, his nose, including the bone, was perfectly flat, and one
                  cheek and one eye were so beaten in, that the hollow would almost receive a man's
                  fist, yet no ulcer remained; and our companion, Tupia, had been pierced quite
                  through his body by a spear headed with the bone of the sting-ray, the weapon
                  having entered his back, and come out just under his breast; but except in
                  reducing dislocations and fractures, the best surgeon can contribute very little
                  to the cure of a wound; the blood itself is the best vulnerary balsam, and when
                  the juices of the body are pure, and the patient is temperate, nothing more is
                  necessary as an aid to Nature in the cure of the worst wound, than the keeping it
                  clean. </p><p n="431">Their commerce with the inhabitants of Europe has, however, already
                  entailed upon them that dreadful curse which avenged the inhumanities committed by
                  the Spaniards in America, the venereal disease. As it is certain that no European
                  vessel besides our own, except the Dolphin, and the two that were under the
                  command of Mons. Bougainville, ever visited this island, it must have been brought
                  either by one of them or by us. That it was not brought by the Dolphin, Captain
                  Wallis has demonstrated in the account of her <pb n="233"/> voyage,* [vol. I. p.
                  489, 490.] and nothing is more certain than that when we arrived it had made most
                  dreadful ravages in the island. One of our people contracted it within five days
                  after we went on shore, and by the enquiries among the natives, which this
                  occasioned, we learnt, when we came to understand a little of their language, that
                  it had been brought by the vessels which had been there about fifteen months
                  before us, and had lain on the east side of the island. They distinguished it by a
                  name of the same import with rottenness, but of a more extensive signification,
                  and described, in the most pathetic terms, the sufferings of the first victims to
                  its rage, and told us that it caused the hair and the nails to fall off, and the
                  flesh to rot from the bones: that it spread a universal terror and consternation
                  among them, so that the sick were abandoned by their nearest relations, lest the
                  calamity should spread by contagion, and left to perish alone in such misery as
                  till then had never been known among them. We had some reason, however, to hope
                  that they had found out a specific to cure it: during our stay upon the island we
                  saw none in whom it had made a great progress, and one who went from us infected,
                  returned after a short time in perfect health; and by this it appeared either that
                  the disease had cured itself, or that they were not unacquainted with the virtues
                  of simples, nor implicit dupes to the superstitious follies of their priests. We
                  endeavoured to learn the medical qualities which they imputed to their plants, but
                  our knowlege of their language was too imperfect for us to succeed. If we could
                  have learnt their specific for the venereal disease, if such they have, it would
                  have been of great advantage to us, for when we left the island it had been
                  contracted by more than half the people on board the ship. </p><p n="432">It is impossible but that, in relating incidents, many particulars with
                  respect to the customs, opinions, and works of <pb n="234"/> these people should
                  be anticipated;* to avoid repetition, therefore, I shall only supply deficiencies.
                  Of the manner of disposing of their dead, much has been said already. I must more
                  explicitly observe that there are two places in which the dead are deposited; one
                  a kind of shed, where the flesh is suffered to putrefy; the other an enclosure,
                  with erections of stone, where the bones are afterwards buried. The sheds are
                  called TUPAPOW, and the enclosures Morai. The Morais are also places of worship. </p><p n="433">As soon as a native of Otaheite is known to be dead, the house is filled
                  with relations, who deplore their loss, some by loud lamentations, and some by
                  less clamorous, but more genuine expressions of grief. Those who are in the
                  nearest degree of kindred, and are really affected by the event, are silent; the
                  rest are one moment uttering passionate exclamations in a chorus, and the next
                  laughing and talking without the least appearance of concern. In this manner the
                  remainder of the day on which they assemble is spent, and all the succeeding
                  night. On the next morning the body is shrouded in their cloth, and conveyed to
                  the sea side upon a bier, which the bearers support upon their shoulders, attended
                  by the priest, who having prayed over the body, repeats his sentences during the
                  procession: when it arrives at the water's edge, it is set down upon the beach;
                  the priest renews his prayers, and taking up some of the water in his hands,
                  sprinkles it towards the body, but not upon it. It is then carried back forty or
                  fifty yards, and soon after brought again to the beach, where the prayers and
                  sprinkling are repeated: it is thus removed backwards and forwards several times,
                  and while these ceremonies have been performing a house has been built, and a
                  small space of ground railed in. In the center of this house, or Tupapow, posts
                  are set up to support the bier, which is at length conveyed thither, and
                  <!--Page  [unnumbered]--></p><p n="434">[illustration] <pb n="235"/> placed upon it,* and here the body remains to
                  putrify till the flesh is wholly wasted from the bones. These houses of corruption
                  are of a size proportioned to the rank of the person whose body they are to
                  contain; those allotted to the lower class are just sufficient to cover the bier,
                  and have no railing round them. The largest we ever saw was eleven yards long, and
                  such as these are ornamented according to the abilities and inclination of the
                  surviving kindred, who never fail to lay a profusion of good cloth about the body,
                  and sometimes almost cover the outside of the house. Garlands of the fruit of the
                  palm-nut or pandanus, and cocoa leaves, twisted by the priests in mysterious
                  knots, with a plant called by them Ethee no Morai, which is particularly
                  consecrated to funereal solemnities, are deposited about the place; provision and
                  water are also left at a little distance, of which, and of other decorations, a
                  more particular description has been given already. </p><p n="435">As soon as the body is deposited in the Tupapow, the mourning is renewed.
                  The women assemble, and are led to the door by the nearest relation, who strikes a
                  shark's tooth several times into the crown of her head: the blood copiously
                  follows, and is carefully received upon pieces of linen, which are thrown under
                  the bier. The rest of the women follow this example, and the ceremony is repeated
                  at the interval of two or three days, as long as the zeal and sorrow of the
                  parties hold out. The tears also which are shed upon these occasions, are received
                  upon pieces of cloth, and offered as oblations to the dead: some of the younger
                  people cut off their hair, and that is thrown under the bier with the other
                  offerings. This custom is founded upon a notion that the soul of the deceased,
                  which they believe to exist in a separate state, is hovering about the place where
                     <pb n="236"/> the body is deposited:* that it observes the actions of the
                  survivors, and is gratified by such testimonies of their affection and grief. </p><p n="436">Two or three days after these ceremonies have been commenced by the women,
                  during which the men seem to be wholly insensible of their loss, they also begin
                  to perform their part. The nearest relations take it in turn to assume the dress,
                  and perform the office which have already been particularly described in the
                  account of Tubourai Tamaide's having acted as chief mourner to an old woman, his
                  relation, who died while we were in the island. One part of the ceremony, however,
                  which accounts for the running away of the people as soon as this procession is in
                  sight, has not been mentioned. The chief mourner carries in his hand a long flat
                  stick, the edge of which is set with shark's teeth, and in a phrenzy, which his
                  grief is supposed to have inspired, he runs at all he sees, and if any of them
                  happen to be overtaken, he strikes them most unmercifully with this indented
                  cudgel, which cannot fail to wound them in a dangerous manner. </p><p n="437">These processions continue at certain intervals for five moons, but are
                  less and less frequent, by a gradual diminution, as the end of that time
                  approaches. When it is expired, what remains of the body is taken down from the
                  bier, and the bones having been scraped and washed very clean, are buried,
                  according to the rank of the person, either within or without a Morai: if the
                  deceased was an Earee, or Chief, his skull is not buried with the rest of the
                  bones, but is wrapped up in fine cloth, and put in a kind of box made for that
                  purpose, which is also placed in the Morai. This coffer is called Ewharre no te
                  Orometua, the house of a teacher or master. After this the mourning ceases, except
                  some of <pb n="237"/> the women continue to be really afflicted for the loss,* and
                  in that case they will sometimes suddenly wound themselves with the shark's tooth
                  wherever they happen to be: this perhaps will account for the passion of grief in
                  which Terapo wounded herself at the fort; some accidental circumstance might
                  forcibly revive the remembrance of a friend or relation whom she had lost, with a
                  pungency of regret and tenderness which forced a vent by tears, and prompted her
                  to a repetition of the funereal rite. </p><p n="438">The ceremonies, however, do not cease with the mourning: prayers are still
                  said by the priest, who is well paid by the surviving relations, and offerings
                  made at the Morai. Some of the things, which from time to time are deposited
                  there, are emblematical: a young plantain represents the deceased, and the bunch
                  of feathers the deity who is invoked. The priest places himself over-against the
                  symbol of the God, accompanied by some of the relations, who are furnished with a
                  small offering, and repeats his oraison in a set form, consisting of separate
                  sentences; at the same time weaving the leaves of the cocoa-nut into different
                  forms, which he afterwards deposits upon the ground where the bones have been
                  interred; the deity is then addressed by a shrill screech, which is used only upon
                  that occasion. When the priest retires, the tuft of feathers is removed, and the
                  provisions left to putrify, or be devoured by the rats. </p><p n="439">Of the religion of these people,* we were not able to acquire any clear
                  and consistent knowlege: we found it like the religion of most other countries,
                  involved in mystery, and perplexed with apparent inconsistences. The religious
                  language is also here, as it is in China, different from that which is used in
                  common; so that Tupia, who took great pains to instruct us, having no words to
                  express his meaning <pb n="238"/> which we understood,* gave us lectures to very
                  little purpose: what we learnt, however, I will relate with as much perspicuity as
                  I can. </p><p n="440">Nothing is more obvious to a rational being, however ignorant or stupid,
                  than that the universe and its various parts, as far as they fall under his
                  notice, were produced by some agent inconceivably more powerful than himself; and
                  nothing is more difficult to be conceived, even by the most sagacious and knowing,
                  than the production of them from nothing, which among us is expressed by the word
                  Creation. It is natural therefore, as no Being apparently capable of producing the
                  universe is to be seen, that he should be supposed to reside in some distant part
                  of it, or to be in his nature invisible, and that he should have originally
                  produced all that now exists in a manner similar to that in which nature is
                  renovated by the succession of one generation to another; but the idea of
                  procreation includes in it that of two persons, and from the conjunction of two
                  persons these people imagine every thing in the universe either originally or
                  derivatively to proceed. </p><p n="441">The Supreme Deity, one of these two first beings, they call
                  TAROATAIHETOOMOO, and the other, whom they suppose to have been a rock, TEPAPA. A
                  daughter of these was TETTOWMATATAYO, the year, or thirteen months collectively,
                  which they never name but upon this occasion, and she, by the common father,
                  produced the months, and the months, by conjunction with each other, the days: the
                  stars they suppose partly to be the immediate offspring of the first pair, and
                  partly to have increased among themselves; and they have the same notion with
                  respect to the different species of plants. Among other progeny of
                  Taroataihetoomoo and Tepapa, they suppose an inferior race of deities whom they
                  call <pb n="239"/> EATUAS. Two of these Eatuas, they say,* at some remote period
                  of time, inhabited the earth, and were the parents of the first man. When this
                  man, their common ancestor, was born, they say that he was round like a ball, but
                  that his mother, with great care, drew out his limbs, and having at length moulded
                  him into his present form, she called him EOTHE, which signifies finished. That
                  being prompted by the universal instinct to propagate his kind, and being able to
                  find no female but his mother, he begot upon her a daughter, and upon the daughter
                  other daughters for several generations, before there was a son; a son, however,
                  being at length born, he, by the assistance of his sisters, peopled the world. </p><p n="442">Besides their daughter Tettowmatatayo, the first progenitors of nature had
                  a son whom they called TANE. Taroataihetoomoo, the Supreme Deity, they
                  emphatically stile the causer of earthquakes; but their prayers are more generally
                  addressed to Tane, whom they suppose to take a greater part in the affairs of
                  mankind. </p><p n="443">Their subordinate deities or Eatuas, which are numerous, are of both
                  sexes: the male are worshipped by the men, and the female by the women; and each
                  have Morais to which the other sex is not admitted, though they have also Morais
                  common to both. Men perform the office of priest to both sexes, but each sex has
                  its priests, for those who officiate for one sex, do not officiate for the other. </p><p n="444">They believe the immortality of the soul, at least its existence in a
                  separate state, and that there are two situations of different degrees of
                  happiness, somewhat analogous to our heaven and hell: the superior situation they
                  call Tavirua Perai, the other Tiahoboo. They do not, however, consider them as
                  places of reward and punishment, <pb n="240"/> but as receptacles for different
                  classes;* the first, for their Chiefs and principal people, the other for those of
                  inferior rank, for they do not suppose that their actions here in the least
                  influence their future state, or indeed that they come under the cognizance of
                  their deities at all. Their religion, therefore, if it has no influence upon their
                  morals, is at least disinterested; and their expressions of adoration and
                  reverence, whether by words or actions, arise only from a humble sense of their
                  own inferiority, and the ineffable excellence of divine perfection. </p><p n="445">The character of the priest or Tahowa, is hereditary: the class is
                  numerous, and consists of all ranks of people; the chief, however, is generally
                  the younger brother of a good family, and is respected in a degree next to their
                  kings. Of the little knowlege that is possessed in this country, the priests have
                  the greatest share; but it consists principally in an acquaintance with the names
                  and ranks of the different Eatuas or subordinate divinities, and the opinions
                  concerning the origin of things, which have been traditionally preserved among the
                  order in detached sentences, of which some will repeat an incredible number,
                  though but very few of the words that are used in their common dialect occur in
                  them. </p><p n="446">The priests, however, are superior to the rest of the people in the
                  knowlege of navigation and astronomy, and indeed the name Tahowa signifies nothing
                  more than a man of knowlege. As there are priests of every class, they officiate
                  only among that class to which they belong: the priest of the inferior class is
                  never called upon by those of superior rank, nor will the priest of the superior
                  rank officiate for any of the inferior class. </p><p n="447">Marriage in this island, as appeared to us, is nothing more than an
                  agreement between the man and woman, with <pb n="241"/> which the priest has no
                  concern.* Where it is contracted it appears to be pretty well kept, though
                  sometimes the parties separate by mutual consent, and in that case a divorce takes
                  place with as little trouble as the marriage. </p><p n="448">But though the priesthood has laid the people under no tax for a nuptial
                  benediction, there are two operations which it has appropriated, and from which it
                  derives considerable advantages. One is tattowing, and the other circumcision,
                  though neither of them have any connexion with religion. The tattowing has been
                  described already. Circumcision has been adopted merely from motives of
                  cleanliness; it cannot indeed properly be called circumcision, because the prepuce
                  is not mutilated by a circular wound, but only slit through the upper part to
                  prevent its contracting over the glans. As neither of these can be performed by
                  any but a priest, and as to be without either is the greatest disgrace, they may
                  be considered as a claim to surplice fees like our marriages and christenings,
                  which are cheerfully and liberally paid, not according to any settled stipend, but
                  the rank and abilities of the parties or their friends. </p><p n="449">The Morai, as has already been observed, is at once a burying ground and a
                  place of worship, and in this particular our churches too much resemble it. The
                  Indian, however, approaches his Morai with a reverence and humility that disgraces
                  the christian, not because he holds any thing sacred that is there, but because he
                  there worships an invisible divinity, for whom, though he neither hopes for
                  reward, nor fears punishment, at his hand, he always expresses the profoundest
                  homage and most humble adoration. I have already given a very particular
                  description both of the Morais and the altars that are placed near them. When an
                  Indian is <pb n="242"/> about to worship at the Morai,* or brings his offering to
                  the altar, he always uncovers his body to the waste, and his looks and attitude
                  are such as sufficiently express a corresponding disposition of mind. </p><p n="450">It did not appear to us that these people are, in any instance, guilty of
                  idolatry; at least they do not worship any thing that is the work of their hands,
                  nor any visible part of the creation. This island indeed, and the rest that lie
                  near it, have a particular bird, some a heron, and others a king's fisher, to
                  which they pay a peculiar regard, and concerning which they have some
                  superstitious notions with respect to good and bad fortune, as we have of the
                  swallow and robin-red-breast, giving them the name of EATUA, and by no means
                  killing or molesting them; yet they never address a petition to them, or approach
                  them with any act of adoration. </p><p n="451">*Though I dare not assert that these people, to whom the art of writing,
                  and consequently the recording of laws, are utterly unknown, live under a regular
                  form of government; yet a subordination is established among them, that greatly
                  resembles the early state of every nation in Europe under the feudal system, which
                  secured liberty in the most licentious excess to a few, and entailed the most
                  abject slavery upon the rest. </p><p n="452">Their orders are, Earee rahie, which answers to king; Earee, baron;
                  Manahouni, vassal; and Toutou, villain. The Earee rahie, of which there are two in
                  this island, one being the sovereign of each of the peninsulas of which it
                  consists, is treated with great respect by all ranks, but did not appear to us to
                  be invested with so much power as was exercised by the Earees in their own
                  districts; nor indeed did we, as I have <pb n="243"/> before observed, once see
                  the sovereign of Obereonoo,* while we were in the island. The Earees are lords of
                  one or more of the districts into which each of the peninsulas is divided, of
                  which there may be about one hundred in the whole island; and they parcel out
                  their territories to the Manahounies, who cultivate each his part which he holds
                  under the baron. The lowest class, called Toutous, seem to be nearly under the
                  same circumstances as the villains in feudal governments: these do all the
                  laborious work, they cultivate the land under the Manahounies, who are only
                  nominal cultivators for the lord, they fetch wood and water, and, under the
                  direction of the mistress of the family, dress the victuals; they also catch the
                  fish. </p><p n="453">Each of the Earees keeps a kind of court, and has a great number of
                  attendants, chiefly the younger brothers of their own tribe; and among these some
                  hold particular offices, but of what nature exactly we could not tell. One was
                  called the Eowa no l' Earee, and another the Whanno no l' Earee, and these were
                  frequently dispatched to us with messages. Of all the courts of these Earees, that
                  of Tootahah was the most splendid, as indeed might reasonably be expected, because
                  he administered the government for Outou, his nephew, who was Earee rahie of
                  Obereonoo, and lived upon his estate. The child of the baron or Earee, as well as
                  of the sovereign or Earee rahie, succeeds to the title and honours of the father
                  as soon as it is born: so that a baron, who was yesterday called Earee, and was
                  approached with the ceremony of lowering the garments, so as to uncover the upper
                  part of the body, is to-day, if his wife was last night delivered of a child,
                  reduced to the rank of a private man, all marks of respect being transferred to
                  the child, if it is suffered to live, <pb n="244"/> though the father still
                  continues possessor and administrator of his estate:* probably this custom has its
                  share, among other inducements, in forming the societies called Arreoy. </p><p n="454">*If a general attack happens to be made upon the island, every district
                  under the command of an Earee, is obliged to furnish its proportion of soldiers
                  for ther common defence. The number furnished by the principal districts, which
                  Tupia recollected, when added together, amounted, as I have observed before, to
                  six thousand six hundred and eighty. </p><p n="455">Upon such occasions, the united force of the whole island is commanded in
                  chief by the Earee rahie. Private differences between two Earees, are decided by
                  their own people, without at all disturbing the general tranquillity. </p><p n="456">*Their weapons are slings, which they use with great dexterity, pikes
                  headed with the stings of sting-rays, and clubs, of about six or seven feet long,
                  made of a very hard heavy wood. Thus armed, they are said to fight with great
                  obstinacy, which is the more likely to be true, as it is certain that they give no
                  quarter to either man, woman, or child, who is so unfortunate as to fall into
                  their hands during the battle, or for some hours afterwards, till their passion,
                  which is always violent, though not lasting, has subsided. </p><p n="457">The Earee rahie of Obereonoo, while we were here, was in perfect amity
                  with the Earee rahie of Tiarreboo, the other peninsula, though he took himself the
                  title of king of the whole island: this, however, produced no more jealousy in the
                  other sovereign, than the title of king of France, assumed by our sovereign, does
                  in his most Christian Majesty. </p><p n="458">In a government so rude, it cannot be expected that distributive justice
                  should be regularly administered, and indeed <pb n="245"/> where there is so
                  little opposition of interest,* in consequence of the facility with which every
                  appetite and passion is gratified, there can be but few crimes. There is nothing
                  like money, the common medium by which every want and every wish is supposed to be
                  gratified by those who do not possess it; there is no apparently permanent good
                  which either fraud or force can unlawfully obtain; and when all the crimes that
                  are committed by the inhabitants of civilized countries, to get money, are set out
                  of the account, not many will remain: add to this, that where the commerce with
                  woman is restrained by no law, men will seldom be under any temptation to commit
                  adultery, especially as one woman is always less preferred to another, where they
                  are less distinguished by personal decorations, and the adventitious circumstances
                  which are produced by the varieties of art, and the refinements of sentiment. That
                  they are thieves is true; but as among these people no man can be much injured or
                  benefited by theft, it is not necessary to restrain it by such punishments, as in
                  other countries are absolutely necessary to the very existence of civil society.
                  Tupia, however, tells us, that adultery is sometimes committed as well as theft.
                  In all cases where an injury has been committed, the punishment of the offender
                  lies with the sufferer: adultery, if the parties are caught in the fact, is
                  sometimes punished with death in the first ardour of resentment; but without
                  circumstances of immediate provocation, the female sinner seldom suffers more than
                  a beating. As punishment, however, is enforced by no law, nor taken into the hand
                  of any magistrate, it is not often inflicted, except the injured party is the
                  strongest; though the Chiefs do sometimes punish their immediate dependents, for
                  faults committed against each other, and even the dependents of <pb n="246"/>
                  others,* if they are accused of any offence committed in their district. </p><p n="459">Having now given the best description that I can of the island in its
                  present state, and of the people, with their customs and manners, language and
                  arts, I shall only add a few general observations, which may be of use to future
                  navigators, if any of the ships of Great Britain should receive orders to visit
                  it. As it produces nothing that appears to be convertible into an article of
                  trade, and can be useful only by affording refreshments to shipping in their
                  passage through these seas, it might be made to answer this purpose in a much
                  greater degree, by transporting thither sheep, goats, and horned cattle, with
                  European garden-stuff, and other useful vegetables, which there is the greatest
                  reason to suppose will flourish in so fine a climate, and so rich a soil. </p><p n="460">Though this, and the neighbouring islands lie within the tropick of
                  Capricorn, yet the heat is not troublesome, nor did the winds blow constantly from
                  the east. We had frequently a fresh gale from the S. W. for two or three days, and
                  sometimes, though very seldom, from the N. W. Tupia reported, that south westerly
                  winds prevail in October, November, and December, and we have no doubt of the
                  fact. When the winds are variable, they are always accompanied by a swell from the
                  S. W. or W. S. W.; there is also a swell from the same points when it is calm, and
                  the atmosphere loaded with clouds, which is a sure indication that the winds are
                  variable, or westerly out at sea, for with the settled trade-wind the weather is
                  clear. </p><p n="461">The meeting with westerly winds, within the general limits of the eastern
                  trade, has induced some navigators to suppose that they were near some large track
                  of land, of which, however, I think they are no indication. </p><p n="462"><pb n="247"/>It has been found, both by us and the Dolphin,* that the trade-wind,
                  in these parts, does not extend farther to the south than twenty degrees, beyond
                  which, we generally found a gale from the westward; and it is reasonable to
                  suppose, that when these winds blow strong, they will drive back the easterly
                  wind, and consequently incroach upon the limits within which they constantly blow,
                  and thus necessarily produce variable winds, as either happens to prevail, and a
                  south westerly swell. This supposition is the more probable, as it is well known
                  that the trade-winds blow but faintly for some distance within their limits, and
                  therefore may be more easily stopped or repelled by a wind in the contrary
                  direction: it is also well known, that the limits of the trade-winds vary not only
                  at different seasons of the year, but sometimes at the same season, in different
                  years. </p><p n="463">There is therefore no reason to suppose that south westerly winds, within
                  these limits, are caused by the vicinity of large tracts of land, especially as
                  they are always accompanied with a large swell, in the same direction in which
                  they blow; and we find a much greater surf beating upon the shores of the south
                  west side of the islands that are situated just within the limits of the
                  trade-wind, than upon any other part of them. </p><p n="464">The tides about these islands, are perhaps as inconsiderable as in any
                  part of the world. A south or S. by W. moon, makes high water in the bay of
                  Matavai at Otaheite; but the water very seldom rises perpendicularly above ten or
                  twelve inches. </p><p n="465">The variation of the compass, I found to be <geo select="lon">40° 46′ E</geo>asterly,
                  this being the result of a great number of trials made with four of Dr. Knight's
                  needles, adapted to azimuth compasses. <pb n="248"/> These compasses I thought the
                  best that could be procured,* yet, when applied to the meridian line, I found them
                  to differ not only one from another, sometimes a degree and an half, but the same
                  needle, half a degree from itself in different trials made on the same day; and I
                  do not remember that I have ever found two needles which exactly agreed at the
                  same time and place, though I have often found the same needle agree with itself,
                  in several trials made one after the other. This imperfection of the needle,
                  however, is of no consequence to navigation, as the variation can always be found
                  to a degree of accuracy, more than sufficient for all nautical purposes. </p><p n="466"><!--Page  [unnumbered]--></p><p n="467">[illustration] CHART OF THE SOCIETY ISLES, discovered BY LIEUT. J. COOK.

                  and clear weather, and were informed by Tupia, that four of the neighbouring
                  islands, which he distinguished by the names of HUAHEINE, ULIETEA, OTAHA, and
                  BOLABOLA, lay at the distance of between one and two days sail from Otaheite; and
                  that hogs, fowls, and other refreshments, with which we had of late been but
                  sparingly supplied, were there to be procured in great plenty; but having
                  discovered from the hills of Otaheite, an island lying to the northward, which he
                  called TETHUROA, I determined first to stand that way, to take a nearer view of
                  it. It lies N. ½ W. distant eight leagues from the northern extremity of Otaheite,
                  upon which we had observed the transit, and to which we had, for that reason,
                  given the name of POINT VENUS. We found it to be a small low island, and were told
                  by Tupia, that it had no settled inhabitants, but was occasionally visited by the
                  inhabitants of Otaheite, who sometimes went thither for a few days to fish; we
                  therefore determined to spend no more time in a farther examination of it, but to
                  go in search of Huaheine and Ulietea, which he described to be well peopled, and
                  as large as Otaheite. </p><p n="471"><pb n="250"/>*At six o'clock in the morning of the <date>14th</date>, the westermost part of
                  EIMEO, or York Island, bore S. E. ½ S. and the body of Otaheite E. ½ S. At noon,
                  the body of York Island bore E. by S. ½ S. and Port-Royal bay, at Otaheite, S.
                     <geo select="lon">70° 45′ E</geo>. distant 61 miles, and an island which we took to be
                  Saunders's Island, called by the natives TAPOAMANAO, bore S. S. W. We also saw
                  land bearing N. W. ½ W. which Tupia said was Huaheine. </p><p n="472">*On the <date>15th</date>, it was hazy, with light breezes and calms succeeding each
                  other, so that we could see no land, and made but little way. Our Indian, Tupia,
                  often prayed for a wind to his god Tane, and as often boasted of his success,
                  which indeed he took a very effectual method to secure, for he never began his
                  address to Tane, till he saw a breeze so near that he knew it must reach the ship
                  before his oraison was well over. </p><p n="473">*On the <date>16th</date>, we had a gentle breeze; and in the morning about eight
                  o'clock, being close in with the north west part of the island Huaheine,* we
                  sounded, but had no bottom with 80 fathom. Some canoes very soon came off, but the
                  people seemed afraid, and kept at a distance till they discovered Tupia, and then
                  they ventured nearer. In one of the canoes that came up to the ship's side, was
                  the king of the island and his wife. Upon assurances of friendship, frequently and
                  earnestly repeated, their Majesties and some others came on board. At first they
                  were struck with astonishment, and wondered at every thing that was shewn them;
                  yet they made no enquiries, and seeming to be satisfied with what was offered to
                  their notice, they made no search after other objects of curiosity, with which it
                  was natural to suppose a building of such novelty and magnitude as the ship must
                  abound. After some time, they became more familiar. I <pb n="251"/> was given to
                  understand,* that the name of the king was OREE, and he proposed, as a mark of
                  amity, that we should exchange names. To this I readily consented; and he was
                  Cookee, for so he pronounced my name, and I was Oree, for the rest of the time we
                  were together. We found these people to be very nearly the same with those of
                  Otaheite, in person, dress, language, and every other circumstance, except, if
                  Tupia might be believed, that they would not steal. </p><p n="474">Soon after dinner, we came to an anchor, in a small but excellent harbour
                  on the west side of the island, which the Natives call OWHARRE, in eighteen fathom
                  water, clear ground, and secure from all winds. I went immediately ashore,
                  accompanied by Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, Mr. Monkhouse, Tupia, King Cookee, and
                  some other of the natives who had been on board ever since the morning. The moment
                  we landed Tupia stripped himself as low as the waist, and desired Mr. Monkhouse to
                  do the same: he then sat down before a great number of the natives, who were
                  collected together in a large house or shed; for here, as well as at Otaheite, a
                  house consists only of a roof supported upon poles; the rest of us, by his desire,
                  standing behind. He then began a speech or prayer which lasted about a quarter of
                  an hour, the King who stood over against him every now and then answering in what
                  appeared to be set responses. In the course of this harangue he delivered at
                  different times two handkerchiefs, a black silk neckcloth, some beads, two small
                  bunches of feathers, and some plantains, as presents to their Eatua, or God. In
                  return for these, he received for our Eatua, a hog, some young plantains, and two
                  small bunches of feathers, which he ordered to be carried on board the ship. After
                  these ceremonies, which we supposed to be the ratification of a treaty between us,
                  every one was dismissed <pb n="252"/> to go whither he pleased;* and Tupia
                  immediately repaired to offer his oblations at one of the Morais. </p><p n="475">*The next morning, we went on shore again, and walked up the hills, where
                  the productions were exactly the same as those of Otaheite, except that the rocks
                  and clay appeared to be more burnt. The houses were neat, and the boathouses
                  remarkably large; one that we measured was fifty paces long, ten broad, and
                  twenty-four feet high; the whole formed a pointed arch, like those of our old
                  cathedrals, which was supported on one side by twenty-six, and on the other by
                  thirty pillars, or rather posts, about two feet high, and one thick, upon most of
                  which were rudely carved the heads of men, and several fanciful devices, not
                  altogether unlike those which we sometimes see printed from wooden blocks, at the
                  beginning and end of old books. The plains, or flat part of the country, abounded
                  in bread-fruit, and cocoa-nut trees; in some places, however, there were salt
                  swamps and lagoons, which would produce neither. </p><p n="476">*We went again a-shore on the <date>18th</date>, and would have taken the advantage of
                  Tupia's company, in our perambulation; but he was too much engaged with his
                  friends: we took however his boy, whose name was TAYETO, and Mr. Banks went to
                  take a farther view of what had much engaged his attention before; it was a kind
                  of chest or ark, the lid of which was nicely sewed on, and thatched very neatly
                  with palm-nut leaves: it was fixed upon two poles, and supported on little arches
                  of wood, very neatly carved; the use of the poles seemed to be to remove it from
                  place to place, in the manner of our sedan chairs: in one end of it was a square
                  hole, in the middle of which was a ring touching the sides, and leaving the angles
                  open, so as to form a round hole within a square one. The first time Mr. Banks saw
                  this coffer, <!--Page  [unnumbered]--></p><p n="477">[illustration] <pb n="253"/> the aperture at the end was stopped with a
                  piece of cloth,* which, least he should give offence, he left untouched; probably
                  there was then something within, but now the cloth was taken away, and, upon
                  looking into it, it was found empty. The general resemblance between this
                  repository and the Ark of the Lord among the Jews is remarkable; but it is still
                  more remarkable, that upon enquiring of the boy what it was called, he said,
                  Ewharre no Eatua, the house of the God: he could however give no account of its
                  signification or use. We had commenced a kind of trade with the natives, but it
                  went on slowly; for when any thing was offered, not one of them would take it upon
                  his own judgment, but collected the opinions of twenty or thirty people, which
                  could not be done without great loss of time. We got, however, eleven pigs, and
                  determined to try for more the next day. The next day, therefore, we brought out
                  some hatchets,* for which we hoped we should have had no occasion, upon an island
                  which no European had ever visited before. These procured us three very large
                  hogs; and as we proposed to fail in the afternoon, King Oree and several others
                  came on board to take their leave. To the King I gave a small plate of pewter, on
                  which was stamped this inscription, </p><p n="478">His Britannic Majesty's ship, Endeavour, Lieutenant Cook Commander, <date>16th</date>
                  July 1769, Huaheine. I gave him also some medals or counters, resembling the coin
                  of England, struck in the year 1761, with some other presents; and he promised
                  that with none of these, particularly the plate, he would ever part. I thought it
                  as lasting a testimony of our having first discovered this island, as any we could
                  leave behind; and having dismissed our visitors well satisfied, and in great
                  good-humour, we set sail, about half an hour after two in the afternoon. <pb n="254"/>*The island of Huaheine, or Huahene, is situated in the latitude of
                  <geo select="lat" n="25">16° 43′ S</geo>. and longitude <geo select="lon" n="25">150° 52′ W</geo>. from Greenwich: it
                  is distant from Otaheite about thirty-one leagues, in the direction of N. 58 W.
                  and is about seven leagues in compass. Its surface is hilly and uneven, and it has
                  a safe and commodious harbour. The harbour, which is called by the natives OWALLE,
                  or OWHARRE, lies on the west side, under the northermost high land, and within the
                  north end of the reef, which lies along that side of the island; there are two
                  inlets or openings, by which it may be entered, through the reef, about a mile and
                  a half distant from each other; the southermost is the widest, and on the south
                  side of it lies a very small sandy island. </p><p n="479">Huaheine seems to be a month forwarder in its productions than Otaheite,
                  as we found the cocoa-nuts full of kernel, and some of the new bread-fruit fit to
                  eat. Of the cocoa-nuts the inhabitants make a food which they call Poe, by mixing
                  them with yams; they scrape both fine, and having incorporated the powder, they
                  put it into a wooden trough, with a number of hot stones, by which an oily kind of
                  hasty pudding is made, that our people relished very well, especially when it was
                  fryed. Mr. Banks found not more than eleven or twelve new plants; but he observed
                  some insects, and a species of scorpion which he had not seen before. </p><p n="480">The inhabitants seem to be larger made, and more stout, than those of
                  Otaheite. Mr. Banks measured one of the men, and found him to be six feet three
                  inches and an half high; yet they are so lazy, that he could not persuade any of
                  them to go up the hills with him: they said, if they were to attempt it, the
                  fatigue would kill them. The women were very fair, more so than those of Otaheite;
                  and in general, we thought them more handsome, though none that were <pb n="255"/>
                  equal to some individuals. Both sexes seemed to be less timid,* and less curious:
                  it has been observed, that they made no enquiries on board the ship; and when we
                  fired a gun, they were frighted indeed, but they did not fall down, as our friends
                  at Otaheite constantly did when we first came among them. For this difference,
                  however, we can easily account upon other principles; the people at Huaheine had
                  not seen the Dolphin, those at Otaheite had. In one, the report of a gun was
                  connected with the idea of instant destruction; to the other, there was nothing
                  dreadful in it but the appearance and the sound, as they had never experienced its
                  power of dispensing death. </p><p n="481">While we were on shore, we found that Tupia had commended them beyond
                  their merit, when he said that they would not steal; for one of them, was detected
                  in the fact. But when he was seized by the hair, the rest, instead of running
                  away, as the people at Otaheite would have done, gathered round, and enquired what
                  provocation had been given: but this also may be accounted for without giving them
                  credit for superior courage; they had no experience of the consequence of European
                  resentment, which the people at Otaheite had in many instances purchased with
                  life. It must however be acknowledged, to their honour, that when they understood
                  what had happened, they showed strong signs of disapprobation, and prescribed a
                  good beating for the thief, which was immediately administered. </p><p n="482">We now made sail for the island of ULIETEA,* which lies S. W. by W.
                  distant seven or eight leagues from Huaheine, and at half an hour after six in the
                  evening we were within three leagues of the shore, on the eastern side. We stood
                  off and on all night, and when the day broke the next morning,* we stood in for
                  the shore: we soon after discovered an opening <pb n="256"/> in the reef which
                  lies before the island,* within which Tupia told us there was a good harbour. I
                  did not, however, implicitly take his word; but sent the master out in the pinnace
                  to examine it: he soon made the signal for the ship to follow; we accordingly
                  stood in, and anchored in two and twenty fathom, with soft ground. </p><p n="483">The natives soon came off to us in two canoes, each of which brought a
                  woman and a pig. The woman we supposed was a mark of confidence, and the pig was a
                  present; we received both with proper acknowledgments, and complimented each of
                  the ladies with a spike nail and some beads, much to their satisfaction. We were
                  told by Tupia, who has always expressed much fear of the men of Bolabola, that
                  they have made a conquest of this island; and that, if we remain here, they will
                  certainly come down tomorrow, and fight us. We determined, therefore, to go on
                  shore without delay, while the day was our own. </p><p n="484">I landed in company with Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and the other Gentlemen,
                  Tupia being also of the party. He introduced us by repeating the ceremonies which
                  he had performed at Huaheine, after which I hoisted an English jack, and took
                  possession of this and the three neighbouring islands, Huaheine, Otaha, and
                  Bolabola, which were all in sight, in the name of his Britannic Majesty. After
                  this, we took a walk to a great Morai, called TAPODEBOATEA. We found it very
                  different from those of Otaheite; for it consisted only of four walls, about eight
                  feet high, of coral stones, some of which were of an immense size, inclosing an
                  area of about five and twenty yards square, which was filled up with smaller
                  stones: upon the top of it many planks were set up an end, which were carved in
                  their whole length: at a little distance we found an altar, or Ewhatta, upon which
                  lay the <pb n="257"/> last oblation or sacrifice,* a hog of about eighty pounds
                  weight, which had been offered whole, and very nicely roasted. Here were also four
                  or five Ewharre-no-Eatua, or houses of God, to which carriage poles were fitted,
                  like that which we had seen at Huaheine. One of these Mr. Banks examined by
                  putting his hand into it, and found a parcel about five feet long and one thick,
                  wrapped up in matts: he broke a way through several of these matts with his
                  fingers, but at length came to one which was made of the fibres of the cocoa-nut,
                  so firmly plaited together that he found it impossible to tear it, and therefore
                  was forced to desist; especially as he perceived, that what he had done already
                  gave great offence to our new friends. From hence we went to a long house, not far
                  distant, where among rolls of cloth, and several other things, we saw the model of
                  a canoe, about three feet long, to which were tied eight human jaw-bones: we had
                  already learnt that these, like scalps among the Indians of North America, were
                  trophies of war. Tupia affirmed that they were the jaw-bones of the natives of
                  this island; if so, they might have been hung up, with the model of a canoe, as a
                  symbol of invasion, by the warriors of Bolabola, as a memorial of their conquest. </p><p n="485">Night now came on apace, but Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander continued their
                  walk along the shore, and at a little distance saw another Ewharre-no-Eatua, and a
                  tree of the fig kind, the same as that which Mr. Green had seen at Otaheite, in
                  great perfection, the trunk, or rather congeries of the roots of which was
                  forty-two paces in circumference. </p><p n="486">On the <date>21st</date>,* having dispatched the Master in the long-boat to examine the
                  coast of the south part of the island, and one of the Mates in the yawl, to sound
                  the harbour where the ship lay, I went myself in the pinnace, to survey that part
                     <pb n="258"/> of the island which lies to the north.* Mr. Banks and the
                  Gentlemen were again on shore, trading with the natives, and examining the
                  products and curiosities of the country; they saw nothing, however, worthy notice,
                  but some more jaw-bones, of which they made no doubt but that the account they had
                  heard was true. </p><p n="487">*On the <date>22d</date> and <date>23d</date>, having strong gales and hazey weather, I did not
                  think it safe to put to sea; but on the <date>24th</date>, though the wind was still variable,
                  I got under sail, and plyed to the northward within the reef, with a view to go
                  out at a wider opening than that by which I had entered; in doing this, however, I
                  was unexpectedly in the most imminent danger of striking on the rock: the Master,
                  whom I had ordered to keep continually sounding in the chains, suddenly called
                  out, "two fathom." This alarmed me, for though I knew the ship drew at least
                  fourteen feet, and that therefore it was impossible such a shoal should be under
                  her keel; yet the Master was either mistaken, or she went along the edge of a
                  coral rock, many of which, in the neighbourhood of these islands, are as steep as
                  a wall. </p><p n="488">This harbour or bay is called by the natives OOPOA, and taken in its
                  greatest extent, it is capable of holding any number of shipping. It extends
                  almost the whale length of the east side of the island, and is defended from the
                  sea by a reef of coral rocks: the southermost opening in this reef, or channel
                  into the harbour, by which we entered, is little more than a cable's length wide;
                  it lies off the eastermost point of the island, and may be known by another small
                  woody island, which lies a little to the south east of it, called by the people
                  here OATARA.* Between three and four miles north west from this island lie two
                  other islets, in the same direction as the reef,* of which they are a part, called
                  OPURURU <!--Page  [unnumbered]--></p><p n="489">[illustration] <pb n="259"/> and TAMOU;* between these lies the other
                  channel into the harbour, through which I went out, and which is a full quarter of
                  a mile wide. Still farther to the north west are some other small islands, near
                  which I am told there is another small channel into the harbour; but this I know
                  only by report. The principal refreshments that are to be procured at this part of
                  the island are, plantains, cocoa-nuts, yams, hogs, and fowls; the hogs and fowls,
                  however, are scarce; and the country, where we saw it, is neither so populous, nor
                  so rich in produce as Otaheite, or even Huaheine. Wood and water may also be
                  procured here; but the water cannot conveniently be got at. </p><p n="490">We were now again at sea, without having received any interruption from
                  the hostile inhabitants of Bolabola, whom, notwithstanding the fears of Tupia, we
                  intended to visit. At four o'clock in the afternoon of the <date>25th</date>,* we were within a
                  league of Otaha, which bore N. 77 W. To the northward of the south end of that
                  island, on the east side of it, and something more than a mile from the shore, lie
                  two small islands, called TOAHOUTU and WHENNUAIA; between which,* Tupia says,
                  there is a channel into a very good harbour, which lies within the reef, and
                  appearances confirmed his report. </p><p n="491">As I discovered a broad channel between Otaha and Bolabola, I determined
                  rather to go through it, than run to the northward of all; but the wind being
                  right a-head, I got no ground. </p><p n="492">Between five and six in the evening of the <date>26th</date>,* as I was standing to the
                  northward, I discovered a small low island, lying N. by W. or N. N. W. distant
                  four or five leagues from Bolabola. We were told by Tupia that the name of this
                     <pb n="260"/> island is TUBAI;* that it produces nothing but cocoa-nuts, and is
                  inhabited only by three families; though it is visited by the inhabitants of the
                  neighbouring islands, who resort thither to catch fish, with which the coast
                  abounds. </p><p n="493">*On the <date>27th</date>, about noon, the peak of Bolabola bore N. 25 W. and the north
                  end of Otaha, N. 80 W. distant three leagues. The wind continued contrary all this
                  day and the night following.* On the <date>28th</date>, at six in the morning, we were near the
                  entrance of the harbour on the east side of OTAHA,* which has been just mentioned;
                  and finding that it might be examined without losing time, I sent away the Master
                  in the long-boat, with orders to sound it; and, if the wind did not shift in our
                  favour, to land upon the island, and traffic with the natives for such
                  refreshments as were to be had. In this boat went Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, who
                  landed upon the island, and before night purchased three hogs, twenty-one fowls,
                  and as many yams and plantains as the boat would hold. Plantains we thought a more
                  useful refreshment even than pork; for they were boiled and served to the ship's
                  company as bread, and were now the more acceptable as our bread was so full of
                  vermin, that notwithstanding all possible care, we had sometimes twenty of them in
                  our mouths at a time, every one of which tasted as hot as mustard. The island
                  seemed to be more barren than Ulietea, but the produce was of the same kind. The
                  people also exactly resembled those that we had seen at the other islands; they
                  were not numerous, but they flocked about the boat whereever she went from all
                  quarters, bringing with them whatever they had to sell. They paid the strangers,
                  of whom they had received an account from Tupia, the same compliment which they
                  used towards their own Kings, uncovering their shoulders, and wrapping their
                  garments round their breasts; <pb n="261"/> and were so solicitous to prevent its
                  being neglected by any of their people, that a man was sent with them,* who called
                  out to every one they met, telling him what they were, and what he was to do. </p><p n="494">In the mean time, I kept plying off and on, waiting for the boat's return;
                  at half an hour after five, not seeing any thing of her, I fired a gun, and after
                  it was dark hoisted a light; at half an hour after eight, we heard the report of a
                  musquet, which we answered with a gun, and soon after the boat came on board. The
                  Master reported, that the harbour was safe and commodious, with good anchorage
                  from twenty-five to sixteen fathom water, clear ground. </p><p n="495">As soon as the boat was hoisted in, I made sail to the northward, and at
                  eight o'clock in the morning of the <date>29th</date>,* we were close under the Peak of
                  Bolabola, which was high, rude, and craggy. As the island was altogether
                  inaccessible in this part, and we found it impossible to weather it, we tacked and
                  stood off, then tacked again, and after many trips did not weather the south end
                  of it till twelve o'clock at night. At eight o'clock the next morning,* we
                  discovered an island, which bore from us N. <geo select="lon">63° W</geo>. distant about eight
                  leagues; at the same time the Peak of Bolabola bore N. ½ E. distant three or four
                  leagues. This island Tupia called MAURUA,* and said that it was small, wholly
                  surrounded by a reef, and without any harbour for shipping; but inhabited, and
                  bearing the same produce as the neighbouring islands: the middle of it rises in a
                  high round hill, that may be seen at the distance of ten leagues. </p><p n="496">When we were off Bolabola, we saw but few people on the shore, and were
                  told by Tupia that many of the inhabitants were gone to Ulietea. In the afternoon
                  we found ourselves nearly the length of the south end of Ulietea, and to <pb n="262"/> windward of some harbours that lay on the west side of this island.*
                  Into one of these harbours, though we had before been ashore on the other side of
                  the island, I intended to put, in order to stop a leak which we had sprung in the
                  powder room, and to take in more ballast, as I found the ship too light to carry
                  sail upon a wind. As the wind was right against us,* we plied off one of the
                  harbours, and about three o'clock in the afternoon on the <date>1st of August</date>, we came
                  to an anchor in the entrance of the channel leading into it in fourteen fathom
                  water, being prevented from working in, by a tide which set very strong out. We
                  then carried out the kedge-anchor, in order to warp into the harbour; but when
                  this was done, we could not trip the bower-anchor with all the purchase we could
                  make; we were therefore obliged to lie still all night,* and in the morning, when
                  the tide turned, the ship going over the anchor, it tripped of itself, and we
                  warped the ship into a proper birth with ease, and moored in twenty-eight fathom,
                  with a sandy bottom. While this was doing many of the natives came off to us with
                  hogs, fowls, and plantains, which they parted with at an easy rate. </p><p n="497">When the ship was secured, I went on shore to look for a proper place to
                  get ballast and water, both which I found in a very convenient situation. </p><p n="498">This day Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander spent on shore very much to their
                  satisfaction; every body seemed to fear and respect them, placing in them at the
                  same time the utmost confidence, behaving as if conscious that they possessed the
                  power of doing them mischief, without any propensity to make use of it. Men, women
                  and children crowded round them, and followed them wherever they went; but none of
                  them were guilty of the least incivility: on the contrary, whenever there happened
                  to be dirt or water in the way, the <pb n="263"/> men vied with each other to
                  carry them over on their backs.* They were conducted to the houses of the
                  principal people, and were received in a manner altogether new: the people, who
                  followed them while they were in their way, rushed forward as soon as they came to
                  a house, and went hastily in before them, leaving however a lane sufficiently wide
                  for them to pass. When they entered, they found those who had preceded them ranged
                  on each side of a long matt, which was spread upon the ground, and at the farther
                  end of which sat the family: in the first house they entered they found some very
                  young women or children, dressed with the utmost neatness, who kept their station,
                  expecting the strangers to come up to them and make them presents, which they did
                  with the greatest pleasure; for prettier children or better dressed they had never
                  seen. One of them was a girl about six years old; her gown, or upper garment, was
                  red; a large quantity of plaited hair was wound round her head, the ornament to
                  which they give the name of Tamou, and which they value more than any thing they
                  possess. She sat at the upper end of a matt thirty feet long, upon which none of
                  the spectators presumed to set a foot, notwithstanding the crowd; and she leaned
                  upon the arm of a well-looking woman about thirty, who was probably her nurse. Our
                  Gentlemen walked up to her, and as soon as they approached, she stretched out her
                  hand to receive the beads which they offered her, and no Princess in Europe could
                  have done it with a better grace. </p><p n="499">The people were so much gratified by the presents which were made to these
                  girls, that when Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander returned they seemed attentive to
                  nothing but how to oblige them; and in one of the houses they were, by order of
                  the master, entertained with a dance, different from any that they had seen. It
                  was performed by one man, who put <pb n="264"/> upon his head a large cylindrical
                  piece of wicker-work,* or basket, about four feet long and eight inches in
                  diameter, which was faced with feathers, placed perpendicularly, with the tops
                  bending forwards, and edged round with shark's teeth, and the tail feathers of
                  Tropic birds: when he had put on this head-dress, which is called a Whow, he began
                  to dance, moving slowly, and often turning his head so as that the top of his high
                  wicker-cap described a circle, and sometimes throwing it so near the faces of the
                  spectators as to make them start back: this was held among them as a very good
                  joke, and never failed to produce a peal of laughter, especially when it was
                  played off upon one of the strangers. </p><p n="500">*On the <date>3d</date>, we went along the shore to the northward, which was in a
                  direction opposite to that of the route Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander had taken the
                  day before, with a design to purchase stock, which we always found the people more
                  ready to part with, and at a more easy price, at their houses than at the market.
                  In the course of our walk we met with a company of dancers, who detained us two
                  hours, and during all that time afforded us great entertainment. The company
                  consisted of two women dancers, and six men, with three drums; we were informed by
                  Tupia, that they were some of the most considerable people of the island, and that
                  though they were continually going from place to place, they did not, like the
                  little strolling companies of Otaheite, take any gratuity from the spectators. The
                  women had upon their heads a considerable quantity of Tamou, or plaited hair,
                  which was brought several times round the head, and adorned in many parts with the
                  flowers of the cape-jessamine, which were stuck in with much taste, and made a
                  head-dress truly elegant. Their necks, shoulders, and arms were naked; so were the
                  breasts also as low as the parting of <!--Page  [unnumbered]--></p><p n="501">[illustration] <pb n="265"/> the arm; below that, they were covered with
                  black cloth,* which set close to the body; at the side of each breast, next the
                  arm, was placed a small plume of black feathers, much in the same manner as our
                  ladies now wear their nosegays or Bouquets; upon their hips rested a quantity of
                  cloth plaited very full, which reached up to the breast, and fell down below into
                  long petticoats, which quite concealed their feet, and which they managed with as
                  much dexterity as our opera dancers could have done: the plaits above the waist
                  were brown and white alternately, the petticoats below were all white. In this
                  dress they advanced sideways in a measured step, keeping excellent time to the
                  drums, which beat briskly and loud; soon after they began to shake their hips,
                  giving the folds of cloth that lay upon them a very quick motion, which was in
                  some degree continued through the whole dance, though the body was thrown into
                  various postures, sometimes standing, sometimes sitting, and sometimes resting on
                  their knees and elbows, the fingers also being moved at the same time with a
                  quickness scarcely to be imagined. Much of the dexterity of the dancers, however,
                  and the entertainment of the spectators, consisted in the wantonness of their
                  attitudes and gestures, which was, indeed, such as exceeds all description. </p><p n="502">One of these girls had in her ear three pearls; one of them was very
                  large, but so foul that it was of little value; the other two were as big as a
                  middling pea; these were clear, and of a good colour and shape, though spoiled by
                  the drilling. Mr. Banks would fain have purchased them, and offered the owner any
                  thing she would ask for them, but she could not be persuaded to part with them at
                  any price: he tempted her with the value of four hogs, and whatever else <pb n="266"/> she should chuse,* but without success; and indeed they set a value
                  upon their pearls very nearly equal to what they would fetch among us, except they
                  could be procured before they are drilled. </p><p n="503">Between the dances of the women, the men performed a kind of dramatic
                  interlude, in which there was dialogue as well as dancing; but we were not
                  sufficiently acquainted with their language to understand the subject. </p><p n="504">*On the <date>4th</date>, some of our gentlemen saw a much more regular entertainment
                  of the dramatic kind, which was divided into four acts. </p><p n="505">Tupia had often told us that he had large possessions in this island,
                  which had been taken away from him by the inhabitants of Bolabola, and he now
                  pointed them out in the very bay where the ship was at anchor. Upon our going on
                  shore, this was confirmed by the inhabitants, who shewed us several districts or
                  Whennuas, which they acknowledged to be his right. </p><p n="506">*On the <date>5th</date>, I received a present of three hogs, some fowls, several
                  pieces of cloth, the largest we had seen, being fifty yards long, which they
                  unfolded and displayed so as to make the greatest show possible; and a
                  considerable quantity of plantains, cocoa-nuts, and other refreshments, from
                  Opoony, the formidable king, or, in the language of the country, Earee rahie, of
                  Bolabola, with a message that he was at this time upon the island, and that the
                  next day he intended to pay me a visit. </p><p n="507">In the mean time Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander went upon the hills,
                  accompanied by several of the Indians, who conducted them by excellent paths, to
                  such a height, that they plainly saw the other side of the island, and the passage
                  through which the ship had passed the reef between the little islands of Opururu
                  and Tamou, when we landed upon it the <pb n="267"/> first time. As they were
                  returning,* they saw the Indians exercising themselves at what they call Erowhaw,
                  which is nothing more than pitching a kind of light lance, headed with hard wood,
                  at a mark: in this amusement, though they seem very fond of it, they do not excel,
                  for not above one in twelve struck the mark, which was the bole of a plantain
                  tree, at about twenty yards distance. </p><p n="508">On the <date>6th</date>, we all staid at home,* expecting the visit of the great king,
                  but we were disappointed; we had, however, much more agreeable company, for he
                  sent three very pretty girls to demand something in return for his present:
                  perhaps he was unwilling to trust himself on board the ship, or perhaps he thought
                  his messengers would procure a more valuable return for his hogs and poultry than
                  he could himself; be that as it may, we did not regret his absence, nor his
                  messengers their visit. </p><p n="509">In the afternoon, as the great king would not come to us, we determined to
                  go to the great king. As he was lord of the Bolabola men, the conquerors of this,
                  and the terror of all the other islands, we expected to see a Chief young and
                  vigorous, with an intelligent countenance, and an enterprising spirit: we found,
                  however, a poor feeble wretch, withered and decrepit, half blind with age, and so
                  sluggish and stupid that he appeared scarcely to have understanding enough left to
                  know that it was probable we should be gratified either by hogs or women. He did
                  not receive us sitting, or with any state or formality as the other Chiefs had
                  done: we made him our present, which he accepted, and gave a hog in return. We had
                  learnt that his principal residence was at Otaha; and upon our telling him that we
                  intended to go thither in our boats the next morning, and that <pb n="268"/> we
                  should be glad to have him along with us,* he promised to be of the party. </p><p n="510">*Early in the morning, therefore, I set out both with the pinnace and
                  long-boat for Otaha, having some of the gentlemen with me; and in our way we
                  called upon Opoony, who was in his canoe, ready to join us. As soon as we landed
                  at Otaha, I made him a present of an ax, which I thought might induce him to
                  encourage his subjects to bring us such provision as we wanted; but in this we
                  found ourselves sadly disappointed, for after staying with him till noon, we left
                  him without being able to procure a single article. I then proceeded to the north
                  point of the island, in the pinnace, having sent the long-boat another way. As I
                  went along I picked up half a dozen hogs, as many fowls, and some plantains and
                  yams. Having viewed and sketched the harbour on this side of the island, I made
                  the best of my way back, with the long-boat, which joined me soon after it was
                  dark; and about ten o'clock at night we got on board the ship. </p><p n="511">In this excursion Mr. Banks was not with us; he spent the morning on board
                  the ship, trading with the natives, who came off in their canoes, for provisions
                  and curiosities; and in the afternoon he went on shore with his draughtsman, to
                  sketch the dresses of the dancers which he had seen a day or two before. He found
                  the company exactly the same, except that another woman had been added to it: the
                  dancing also of the women was the same, but the interludes of the men were
                  somewhat varied; he saw five or six performed, which were different from each
                  other, and very much resembled the drama of our stage dances.* The next day, he
                  went ashore again, with Dr. Solander, and they directed their course towards the
                  dancing company, which, from the <pb n="269"/> time of our second landing,* had
                  gradually moved about two leagues in their course round the island. They saw more
                  dancing and more interludes, the interludes still varying from each other: in one
                  of them the performers, who were all men, were divided into two parties, which
                  were distinguished from each other by the colour of their cloaths, one being
                  brown, and the other white. The brown party represented a master and servants, and
                  the white party a company of thieves: the master gave a basket of meat to the rest
                  of his party, with a charge to take care of it: the dance of the white party
                  consisted of several expedients to steal it, and that of the brown party in
                  preventing their success. After some time, those who had charge of the basket
                  placed themselves round it, upon the ground, and leaning upon it, appeared to go
                  to sleep; the others, improving this opportunity, came gently upon them, and
                  lifting them up from the basket, carried off their prize: the sleepers soon after
                  awaking, missed their basket, but presently fell a dancing, without any farther
                  regarding their loss; so that the dramatic action of this dance was, according to
                  the severest laws of criticism, one, and our lovers of simplicity would here have
                  been gratified with an entertainment perfectly suited to the chastity of their
                  taste. </p><p n="512">On the <date>9th</date>,* having spent the morning in trading with the canoes, we took
                  the opportunity of a breeze, which sprung up at East, and having stopped our leak,
                  and got the fresh stock which we had purchased on board, we sailed out of the
                  harbour. When we were sailing away, Tupia strongly urged me to fire a shot towards
                  Bolabola, possibly as a mark of his resentment, and to shew the power of his new
                  allies: in this I thought proper to gratify him, though we were seven leagues
                  distant. </p><p n="513"><pb n="270"/>*While we were about these islands, we expended very little of the
                  ship's provisions, and were very plentifully supplied with hogs, fowls, plantains
                  and yams, which we hoped would have been of great use to us in our course to the
                  southward; but the hogs would not eat European grain of any kind, pulse, or
                  bread-dust, so that we could not preserve them alive; and the fowls were all very
                  soon seized with a disease that affected the head so, that they continued to hold
                  it down between their legs till they died: much dependence therefore must not be
                  placed in live stock taken on board at these places, at least not till a discovery
                  is made of some food that the hogs will eat, and some remedy for the disease of
                  the poultry. </p><p n="514">Having been necessarily detained at Ulietea so long, by the carpenters in
                  stopping our leak, we determined to give up our design of going on shore at
                  Bolabola, especially as it appeared to be difficult of access. </p><p n="515">To these six islands, Ulietea, Otaha, Bolabola, Huaheine, Tubai, and
                  Maurua, as they lie contiguous to each other, I gave the names of SOCIETY
                  ISLANDS,* but did not think it proper to distinguish them separately by any other
                  names than those by which they were known to the natives. </p><p n="516">They are situated between the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="26">16° 10′</geo> and <geo select="lat" n="27">16°
                  55′ S</geo>. and between the longitude of <geo select="lon" n="26">150° 57′</geo> and <geo select="lon" n="27">152°
                     W</geo>. from the meridian of Greenwich. Ulietea and Otaha lie within about two
                  miles of each other, and are both inclosed within one reef of coral rocks, so that
                  there is no passage for shipping between them. This reef forms several excellent
                  harbours; the entrances into them, indeed, are but narrow, yet when a ship is once
                  in, nothing can hurt her. The harbours on the east side have been described
                  already; and on the west side of Ulietea, which is the largest of the two, there
                     <pb n="271"/> are three. The northermost, in which we lay,* is called
                  OHAMANENO: the channel leading into it is about a quarter of a mile wide, and lies
                  between two low sandy islands, which are the northermost on this side; between, or
                  just within the two islands, there is good anchorage in twenty-eight fathom, soft
                  ground. This harbour, though small, is preferable to the others, because it is
                  situated in the most fertile part of the island, and where fresh water is easily
                  to be got. The other two harbours lie to the southward of this, and not far from
                  the south end of the island: in both of them there is good anchorage, with ten,
                  twelve, and fourteen fathom. They are easily known by three small woody islands at
                  their entrance. The southermost of these two harbours lies within, and to the
                  southward of the southermost of these islands, and the other, lies between the two
                  northermost. I was told that there were more harbours at the south end of this
                  island, but I did not examine whether the report was true. </p><p n="517">Otaha affords two very good harbours, one on the east side, and the other
                  on the west. That on the east side is called Ohamene, and has been mentioned
                  already; the other is called OHERURUA, and lies about the middle of the south west
                  side of the island; it is pretty large, and affords good anchorage in twenty and
                  twenty-five fathom, nor is there any want of fresh water. The breach in the reef,
                  that forms a channel into this harbour, is about a quarter of a mile broad, and
                  like all the rest is very sleep on both sides; in general there is no danger here
                  but what is visible. </p><p n="518">The island of Bolabola lies N. W. and by W. from Otaha, distant about four
                  leagues; it is surrounded by a reef of rocks, and several small islands, in
                  compass together about eight leagues. I was told, that on the south west side of
                     <pb n="272"/> the island there is a channel through the reef into a very good
                  harbour,* but I did not think it worth while to examine it, for the reasons that
                  have been just assigned. This island is rendered very remarkable by a high craggy
                  hill, which appears to be almost perpendicular, and terminates at the top in two
                  peaks, one higher than the other. </p><p n="519">The land of Ulietea and Otaha is hilly, broken, and irregular, except on
                  the sea coast, yet the hills look green and pleasant, and are in many places
                  clothed with wood. The several particulars in which these islands and their
                  inhabitants differ from what we had observed at Otaheite, have been mentioned in
                  the course of the narrative. </p><p n="520">We pursued our course without any event worthy of note till the <date>13th</date>,*
                  about noon, when we saw land bearing S. E. which Tupia told us was an island
                  called OHETEROA.* About six in the evening, we were within two or three leagues of
                  it, upon which I shortened sail, and stood off and on all night:* the next morning
                  stood in for the land. We ran to leeward of the island, keeping close in more, and
                  saw several of the natives, though in no great numbers, upon the beach. At nine
                  o'clock I sent Mr. Gore, one of my Lieutenants, in the pinnace, to endeavour to
                  land upon the island, and learn from the natives whether there was anchorage in a
                  bay then in sight, and what land lay farther to the southward. Mr. Banks and Dr.
                  Solander accompanied Mr. Gore in this expedition, and as they thought Tupia might
                  be useful, they took him with them. </p><p n="521">As the boat approached the shore, those on board perceived the natives to
                  be armed with long lances; as they did not intend to land till they got round a
                  point which run out at a little distance, they stood along the coast, and the
                  natives therefore very probably thought they were afraid of them. <pb n="273"/>
                  They had now got together to the number of about sixty,* and all of them sat down
                  upon the shore, except two, who were dispatched forward to observe the motions of
                  those in the boat. These men, after walking a-breast of her some time, at length
                  leaped into the water, and swam towards her, but were soon left behind; two more
                  then appeared, and attempted to board her in the same manner, but they also were
                  soon left behind; a fifth man then ran forward alone, and having got a good way
                  a-head of the boat before he took to the water, easily reached her. Mr. Banks
                  urged the officer to take him in, thinking it a good opportunity to get the
                  confidence and good-will of a people, who then certainly looked upon them as
                  enemies, but he obstinately refused: this man therefore was left behind like the
                  others, and so was a sixth, who followed him. </p><p n="522">When the boat had got round the point, she perceived that all her
                  followers had desisted from the pursuit: she now opened a large bay, at the bottom
                  of which appeared another body of men, armed with long lances like the first. Here
                  our people prepared to land, and pushed towards the shore, a canoe at the same
                  time putting off to meet them. As soon as it came near them, they lay upon their
                  oars, and calling out to them, told them that they were friends, and that if they
                  would come up they would give them nails, which were held up for them to see:
                  after some hesitation they came up to the boat's stern, and took some nails that
                  were offered them with great seeming satisfaction; but in less than a minute they
                  appeared to have formed a design of boarding the boat, and making her their prize:
                  three of them suddenly leaped into it, and the others brought up the canoe, which
                  the motion in quitting her had thrown off a little, manifestly with a design to
                  follow their associates, and support them in <pb n="274"/> their attempt.* The
                  first that boarded the boat, entered close to Mr. Banks, and instantly snatched
                  his powder-horn out of his pocket: Mr. Banks seized it, and with some difficulty
                  wrenched it out of his hand, at the same time pressing against his breast in order
                  to force him over-board, but he was too strong for him, and kept his place: the
                  officer then snapped his piece, but it missed fire, upon which he ordered some of
                  the people to fire over their heads; two pieces were accordingly discharged, upon
                  which they all instantly leaped into the water: one of the people, either from
                  cowardice or cruelty, or both, levelled a third piece at one of them as he was
                  swimming away, and the ball grazed his forehead; happily, however, the wound was
                  very slight, for he recovered the canoe, and stood up in her as active and
                  vigorous as the rest. The canoe immediately stood in for the shore, where a great
                  number of people, not less than two hundred, were now assembled. The boat also
                  pushed in, but found the land guarded all round with a shoal, upon which the sea
                  broke with a considerable surf; it was therefore thought advisable by the officer
                  to proceed along shore in search of a more convenient landing-place: in the mean
                  time the people on board saw the canoe go on shore, and the natives gather eagerly
                  round her to enquire the particulars of what had happened. Soon after, a single
                  man ran along the shore, armed with his lance, and when he came a-breast of the
                  boat he began to dance, brandish his weapon, and call out in a very shrill tone,
                  which Tupia said was a defiance from the people. The boat continued to row along
                  the shore, and the champion followed it, repeating his defiance by his voice and
                  his gestures; but no better landing-place being found than that where the canoe
                  had put the natives on shore, the officer turned back with a view to attempt it
                  there, hoping, that if <pb n="275"/> it should not be practicable,* the people
                  would come to a conference either on the shoals or in their canoes, and that a
                  treaty of peace might be concluded with them. </p><p n="523">As the boat rowed slowly along the shore back again, another champion came
                  down, shouting defiance, and brandishing his lance: his appearance was more
                  formidable than that of the other, for he wore a large cap made of the tail
                  feathers of the tropic bird, and his body was covered with stripes of different
                  coloured cloth, yellow, red, and brown. This gentleman also danced, but with much
                  more nimbleness and dexterity than the first; our people therefore, considering
                  his agility and his dress, distinguished him by the name of HARLEQUIN. Soon after
                  a more grave and elderly man came down to the beach, and hailing the people in the
                  boat, enquired who they were, and from whence they came; Tupia answered in their
                  own language, from Otaheite: the three natives then walked peaceably along the
                  shore till they came to a shoal, upon which a few people were collected; here they
                  stopped, and after a short conference, they all began to pray very loud: Tupia
                  made his responses, but continued to tell us that they were not our friends. When
                  their prayer, or as they call it, their Poorah, was over, our people entered into
                  a parley with them, telling them, that if they would lay by their lances and
                  clubs, for some had one and some the other, they would come on shore, and trade
                  with them for whatever they would bring: they agreed, but it was only upon
                  condition that we would leave behind us our musquets: this was a condition which,
                  however equitable it might appear, could not be complied with, nor indeed would it
                  have put the two parties upon an equality, except their numbers had been equal.
                  Here then the negociation seemed to be at an end; but in a little time they
                  ventured to come nearer to the boat, and at last came near enough to trade, <pb n="276"/> which they did very fairly,* for a small quantity of their cloth and
                  some of their weapons; but as they gave our people no hope of provisions, nor
                  indeed any thing else except they would venture through a narrow channel to the
                  shore, which, all circumstances considered, they did not think it prudent to do,
                  they put off the boat and left them. </p><p n="524">With the ship and the boat we had now made the circuit of the island, and
                  finding that there was neither harbour nor anchorage about it, and that the
                  hostile disposition of the people would render landing impracticable, without
                  bloodshed, I determined not to attempt it, having no motive that could justify the
                  risk of life. </p><p n="525">The bay which the boat entered lies on the west side of the island, the
                  bottom was foul and rocky, but the water so clear that it could plainly be seen at
                  the depth of five and twenty fathom, which is one hundred and fifty feet. </p><p n="526">This island is situated in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="28">22° 27′ S</geo>, and in
                  the longitude of <geo select="lon" n="28">150° 47′ W</geo>. from the meridian of Greenwich. It is
                  thirteen miles in circuit, and rather high than low, but neither populous nor
                  fertile in proportion to the other islands that we had seen in these seas. The
                  chief produce seems to be the tree of which they make their weapons, called in
                  their language Etoa; many plantations of it were seen along the shore, which is
                  not surrounded, like the neighbouring islands, by a reef. </p><p n="527">The people seemed to be lusty and well-made, rather browner than those we
                  had left: under their arm-pits they had black marks about as broad as the hand,
                  the edges of which formed not a strait but an indented line; they had also circles
                  of the same colour, but not so broad, round their arms and legs, but were not
                  marked on any other part of the body. </p><p n="528"><pb n="277"/>Their dress was very different from any that we had seen before, as
                  well as the cloth of which it was made.* The cloth was of the same materials as
                  that which is worn in the other islands, and most of that which was seen by our
                  people was dyed of a bright but deep yellow, and covered on the outside with a
                  composition like varnish, which was either red, or of a dark lead-colour; over
                  this ground it was again painted in stripes of many different patterns, with
                  wonderful regularity, in the manner of our striped silks in England; the cloth
                  that was painted red was striped with black, and that which was painted
                  lead-colour with white. Their habit was a short jacket of this cloth, which
                  reached about as low as their knees; it was of one piece, and had no other making
                  than a hole in the middle of it, stitched round with long stitches, in which it
                  differed from all that we had seen before▪ through this hole the head was put, and
                  what hung down was confined to their bodies by a piece of yellow cloth or sash,
                  which passing round the neck behind, was crossed upon the breast, and then
                  collected round the waist like a belt, which passed over another belt of red
                  cloth, so that they made a very gay and warlike appearance; some had caps of the
                  feathers of the tropic bird, which have been before described, and some had a
                  piece of white or lead-coloured cloth wound about the head like a small turban,
                  which our people thought more becoming. </p><p n="529">Their arms were long lances, made of the Etoa, the wood of which is very
                  hard; they were well polished and sharpened at one end: some were near twenty feet
                  long, though not more than three fingers thick: they had also a weapon which was
                  both club and pike, made of the same wood, about seven feet long; this also was
                  well polished, and sharpened at one end into a broad point. As a guard <pb n="278"/> against these weapons,* when they attack each other, they have matts folded up
                  many times, which they place under their clothes from the neck to the waist: the
                  weapons themselves indeed are capable of much less mischief than those of the same
                  kind which we saw at the other islands, for the lances were there pointed with the
                  sharp bone of the sting-ray that is called the sting, and the pikes were of much
                  greater weight. The other things that we saw here were all superior in their kind
                  to any we had seen before; the cloth was of a better colour in the dye, and
                  painted with greater neatness and taste; the clubs were better cut and polished,
                  and the canoe, though a small one, was very rich in ornament, and the carving was
                  executed in a better manner: among other decorations peculiar to this canoe, was a
                  line of small white feathers, which hung from the head and stern on the outside,
                  and which, when we saw them, were thoroughly wetted by the spray. </p><p n="530">Tupia told us, that there were several islands lying at different
                  distances and in different directions from this, between the south and the north
                  west; and that at the distance of three days sail to the north east, there was an
                  island called MANUA, bird-island: he seemed, however, most desirous that we should
                  sail to the westward, and described several islands in that direction which he
                  said he had visited: he told us that he had been ten or twelve days in going
                  thither, and thirty in coming back, and that the Pahie in which he had made the
                  voyage, sailed much faster than the ship: reckoning his Pahie therefore to go at
                  the rate of forty leagues a day, which from my own observation I have great reason
                  to think these boats will do, it would make four hundred leagues in ten days,
                  which I compute to be the distance of Boscawen and Keppel's Islands, discovered by
                  Captain Wallis, <pb n="279"/> westward of Ulietea,* and therefore think it very
                  probable that they were the islands he had visited. The farthest island that he
                  knew any thing of to the southward, he said, lay at the distance of about two days
                  sail from Oteroah, and was called MOUTOU; but he said that his father had told him
                  there were islands to the southward of that: upon the whole, I was determined to
                  stand southward in search of a continent, but to spend no time in searching for
                  islands, if we did not happen to fall in with them during our course. </p><p n="531"><!--Page  [unnumbered]--></p><p n="532">[illustration] CHART of NEW-ZEALAND, explored in 1769 and 1770. by Lieut:

                  from a locker, where it had been carefully treasured up for this occasion, and
                  tapping a cask of porter, which proved to be very good and in excellent order. On
                  the <date>29th</date>, one of the sailors got so drunk, that the next morning he died: we
                  thought at first that he could not have come honestly by the liquor, but we

                  given him part of a bottle of rum. </p><p n="534">On the <date>30th</date> we saw the comet;* at one o'clock in the morning it was a
                  little above the horizon in the eastern part of the heavens; at about half an hour
                  after four it passed the meridian, and its tail subtended an angle of forty-two
                  degrees. <pb n="282"/> Our latitude was <geo select="lat" n="29">38° 20′ S</geo>. our longitude,* by

                  instantly cried out, that as soon as it should be seen by the people of Bolabola,
                  they would kill the inhabitants of Ulietea, who would with the utmost
                  precipitation fly to the mountains. </p><p n="535">*On the <date>1st of September</date>, being in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="30">40° 22′ S</geo>.

                  northward, fearing that we might receive such damage in our sails and rigging, as
                  would hinder the prosecution of the voyage. </p><p n="536">*On the next day, there being strong gales to the westward, I brought to,
                  with the ship's head to the northward; but in the morning of the <date>3d</date>,* the wind
                  being more moderate, we loosened the reef of the main-sail, set the top-sails, and
                  plied to the westward. </p><p n="537">*We continued our course till the <date>19th</date>, when our latitude being
                  <geo select="lat" n="31">29°</geo> and our longitude <geo select="lon" n="31">159° 29′</geo>, we observed the variation
                  to be <geo select="lon">8° 32′ E</geo>.* On the <date>24th</date>, being in latitude <geo select="lat" n="32">33° 18′</geo>,
                  longitude <geo select="lon" n="32">162° 51′</geo>, we observed a small piece of sea weed, and a piece
                  of wood covered with barnacles: the variation here was <geo select="lon">10° 48′ E</geo>. </p><p n="538">*On the <date>27th</date>, being in latitude <geo select="lat" n="33">28° 59′</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon" n="33">169°
                     5′</geo>, we saw a seal asleep upon the water, and several bunches of sea
                  weed.* The next day we saw more sea weed in bunches, and on the <date>29th</date>,* a bird,
                  which we thought a land bird; it somewhat resembled a snipe, but had a short bill.
                  On the <date>1st of October</date>,* we saw birds innumerable, and another seal asleep upon the
                  water; it is a general opinion that seals never go out of soundings, or far from
                  land, but those that we saw in <pb n="283"/> these seas prove the contrary.
                  Rock-weed is, however,* a certain indication that land is not far distant. The
                  next day, it being calm, we hoisted out the boat, to try whether there was a
                  current, but found none. Our latitude was <geo select="lat" n="34">37° 10′</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon" n="34">172°
                     54′ W</geo>. On the <date>3d</date>, being in latitude <geo select="lat" n="35">36° 56′</geo>,* longitude
                  <geo select="lon" n="35">173° 27′</geo>, we took up more sea-weed, and another piece of wood
                  covered with barnacles.* The next day we saw two more seals, and a brown bird,
                  about as big as a raven, with some white feathers under the wing. Mr. Gore told
                  us, that birds of this kind were seen in great numbers about Falkland's Islands,
                  and our people gave them the name of Port-Egmont hens. </p><p n="539">On the <date>5th</date>, we thought the water changed colour,* but upon casting the
                  lead, had no ground with 180 fathom. In the evening of this day, the variation was
                     <geo select="lon">12° 50′ E</geo>. and while we were going nine leagues it encreased to
                     <geo select="lon">14° 2′</geo>. </p><p n="540">On the next day, Friday, October the <date>6th</date>,* we saw land from the mast-head,
                  bearing W. by N. and stood directly for it; in the evening it could just be
                  discerned from the deck, and appeared large. The variation this day was, by
                  azimuth and amplitude, <geo select="lon">15° 4′ ½ E</geo>. and by observation made of the sun
                  and moon, the longitude of the ship appeared to be <geo select="lon">180° 55′ W</geo>. and by
                  the medium of this and subsequent observations, there appeared to be an error in
                  the ship's account of longitude during her run from Otaheite of <geo select="lon">3° 16′</geo>,
                  she being so much to the westward of the longitude resulting from the log. At
                  midnight, I brought to and sounded, but had no ground with one hundred and seventy
                  fathom. </p><p n="541">On the <date>7th</date>, it fell calm, we therefore approached the land slowly, and in
                  the afternoon, when a breeze sprung up,* we were still distant seven or eight
                  leagues. It appeared still larger as it was more distinctly seen, with four or
                  five ranges <pb n="284"/> of hills,* rising one over the other, and a chain of
                  mountains above all, which appeared to be of an enormous height. This land became
                  the subject of much eager conversation; but the general opinion seemed to be that
                  we had found the Terra australis incognita. About five o'clock we saw the opening
                  of a bay, which seemed to run pretty far inland, upon which we hauled our wind and
                  stood in for it; we also saw smoke ascending from different places on shore. When
                  night came on,* however, we kept plying off and on till day-light, when we found
                  ourselves to the leeward of the bay, the wind being at north: we could now
                  perceive that the hills were cloathed with wood, and that some of the trees in the
                  valleys were very large. By noon we fetched in with the south west point; but not
                  being able to weather it, tacked and stood off: at this time we saw several canoes
                  standing cross the bay, which in a little time made to shore, without seeming to
                  take the least notice of the ship; we also saw some houses, which appeared to be
                  small, but neat; and near one of them a considerable number of the people
                  collected together, who were sitting upon the beach, and who, we thought, were the
                  same that we had seen in the canoes. Upon a small peninsula, at the north east
                  head, we could plainly perceive a pretty high and regular paling, which inclosed
                  the whole top of a hill; this was also the subject of much speculation, some
                  supposing it to be a park of deer, others an inclosure for oxen and sheep. About
                  four o'clock in the afternoon, we anchored on the north west side of the bay,
                  before the entrance of a small river, in ten fathom water, with a fine sandy
                  bottom, and at about half a league from the shore. The sides of the bay are white
                  cliffs of a great height; the middle is low land, with hills gradually rising
                  behind, one towering above another, and terminating in the chain of mountains
                  which appeared to be far inland. </p><p n="542"><pb n="285"/>In the evening I went on shore,* accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr.
                  Solander, with the pinnace and yawl, and a party of men. We landed abreast of the
                  ship, on the east side of the river, which was here about forty yards broad; but
                  seeing some natives on the west side whom I wished to speak with, and finding the
                  river not fordable, I ordered the yawl in to carry us over, and left the pinnace
                  at the entrance. When we came near the place where the people were assembled, they
                  all ran away; however, we landed, and leaving four boys to take care of the yawl,
                  we walked up to some huts which were about two or three hundred yards from the
                  water-side. When we had got some distance from the boat, four men, armed with long
                  lances, rushed out of the woods, and running up to attack the boat, would
                  certainly have cut her off, if the people in the pinnace had not discovered them,
                  and called to the boys to drop down the stream: the boys instantly obeyed; but
                  being closely pursued by the Indians, the Cockswain of the pinnace, who had the
                  charge of the boats, fired a musquet over their heads; at this they stopped and
                  looked round them, but in a few minutes renewed the pursuit, brandishing their
                  lances in a threatening manner: the Cockswain then fired a second musquet over
                  their heads, but of this they took no notice; and one of them lifting up his spear
                  to dart it at the boat, another piece was fired, which shot him dead. When he
                  fell, the other three stood motionless for some minutes, as if petrified with
                  astonishment; as soon as they recovered, they went back, dragging after them the
                  dead body, which however they soon left, that it might not incumber their flight.
                  At the report of the first musquet we drew together, having straggled to a little
                  distance from each other, and made the best of our way back to the boat; and
                  crossing the river, we soon saw the Indian lying dead upon the ground. Upon
                  examining the body, we found <pb n="286"/> that he had been shot through the
                  heart:* he was a man of the middle size and stature; his complexion was brown, but
                  not very dark; and one side of his face was tattowed in spiral lines of a very
                  regular figure: he was covered with a fine cloth, of a manufacture altogether new
                  to us, and it was tied on exactly according to the representation in Valentyn's
                  Account of Abel Tasman's Voyage, vol. iii. part 2. page 50. his hair also was tied
                  in a knot on the top of his head, but had no feather in it. We returned
                  immediately to the ship, where we could hear the people on shore talking with
                  great earnestness, and in a very loud tone, probably about what had happened, and
                  what should be done. </p><p n="543">*In the morning, we saw several of the natives where they had been seen
                  the night before, and some walking with a quick pace towards the place where we
                  had landed, most of them unarmed; but three or four with long pikes in their
                  hands. As I was desirous to establish an intercourse with them, I ordered three
                  boats to be manned with seamen and marines, and proceeded towards the shore,
                  accompanied by Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, the other Gentlemen, and Tupia; about
                  fifty of them seemed to wait for our landing, on the opposite side of the river,
                  which we thought a sign of fear, and seated themselves upon the ground: at first,
                  therefore, myself, with only Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and Tupia, landed from the
                  little boat, and advanced towards them; but we had not proceeded many paces before
                  they all started up, and every man produced either a long pike, or a small weapon
                  of green Talc, extremely well polished, about a foot long, and thick enough to
                  weigh four or five pounds: Tupia called to them in the language of Otaheite; but
                  they answered only by flourishing their weapons, and making signs to us to depart;
                  a musquet was then fired wide of them, and the ball struck the water, the river
                  being still between us: <pb n="287"/> they saw the effect, and desisted from their
                  threats;* but we thought it prudent to retreat till the marines could be landed.
                  This was soon done; and they marched, with a jack carried before them, to a little
                  bank, about fifty yards from the water-side; here they were drawn up, and I again
                  advanced, with Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander; Tupia, Mr. Green, and Mr. Monkhouse,
                  being with us. Tupia was again directed to speak to them, and it was with great
                  pleasure that we perceived he was perfectly understood, he and the natives
                  speaking only different dialects of the same language. He told them that we wanted
                  provision and water, and would give them iron in exchange, the properties of which
                  he explained as well as he was able. They were willing to trade, and desired that
                  we would come over to them for that purpose: to this we consented, provided they
                  would lay by their arms; which, however, they could by no means be persuaded to
                  do. During this conversation, Tupia warned us to be upon our guard, for that they
                  were not our friends: we then pressed them in our turn to come over to us; and at
                  last one of them stripped himself, and swam over without his arms: he was almost
                  immediately followed by two more, and soon after by most of the rest, to the
                  number of twenty or thirty; but these brought their arms with them. We made them
                  all presents of iron and beads; but they seemed to set little value upon either,
                  particularly the iron, not having the least idea of its use; so that we got
                  nothing in return but a few feathers: they offered indeed to exchange their arms
                  for ours, and, when we refused, made many attempts to snatch them out of our
                  hands. As soon as they came over, Tupia repeated his declaration, that they were
                  not our friends, and again warned us to be upon our guard; their attempts to
                  snatch our weapons, therefore, did not succeed; and we gave them to understand by
                  Tupia, that we should <pb n="288"/> be obliged to kill them if they offered any
                  farther violence.* In a few minutes, however, Mr. Green happening to turn about,
                  one of them snatched away his hanger, and retiring to a little distance, waved it
                  round his head, with a shout of exultation: the rest now began to be extremely
                  insolent, and we saw more coming to join them from the opposite side of the river.
                  It was therefore become necessary to repress them, and Mr. Banks fired at the man
                  who had taken the hanger with small shot, at the distance of about fifteen yards:
                  when the shot struck him, he ceased his cry; but instead of returning the hanger,
                  continued to flourish it over his head, at the same time slowly retreating to a
                  greater distance. Mr. Monkhouse seeing this, fired at him with ball, and he
                  instantly dropped. Upon this the main body, who had retired to a rock in the
                  middle of the river upon the first discharge, began to return; two that were near
                  to the man who had been killed, ran up to the body, one feized his weapon of green
                  Tale, and the other endeavoured to secure the hanger, which Mr. Monkhouse had but
                  just time to prevent. As all that had retired to the rock were now advancing,
                  three of us discharged our pieces, loaded only with small shot, upon which they
                  swam back for the shore; and we perceived, upon their landing, that two or three
                  of them were wounded. They retired slowly up the country, and we reimbarked in our
                  boats. </p><p n="544">As we had unhappily experienced that nothing was to be done with these
                  people at this place, and finding the water in the river to be salt, I proceeded
                  in the boats round the head of the bay in search of fresh water, and with a
                  design, if possible, to surprise some of the natives, and take them on board,
                  where by kind treatment and presents I might obtain their friendship, and by their
                  means establish an amicable correspondence with their countrymen. </p><p n="545"><pb n="289"/>To my great regret, I found no place where I could land,* a dangerous
                  surf every where beating upon the shore; but I saw two canoes coming in from the
                  sea, one under sail, and the other worked with paddles. I thought this a
                  favourable opportunity to get some of the people into my possession without
                  mischief, as those in the canoe were probably fishermen and without arms, and I
                  had three boats full of men. I therefore disposed the boats so as most effectually
                  to intercept them in their way to the shore; the people in the canoe that was
                  paddled perceived us so soon, that by making to the nearest land with their utmost
                  strength, they escaped us; the other sailed on till she was in the midst of us,
                  without discerning what we were; but the moment she discovered us, the people on
                  board struck their sail, and took to their paddles, which they plied so briskly
                  that she out-ran the boat. They were however within hearing, and Tupia called out
                  to them to come along side, and promised for us that they should come to no hurt:
                  they chose, however, rather to trust to their paddles than our promises, and
                  continued to make from us with all their power. I then ordered a musquet to be
                  fired over their heads, as the least exceptionable expedient to accomplish my
                  design, hoping it would either make them surrender or leap into the water. Upon
                  the discharge of the piece, they ceased paddling; and all of them, being seven in
                  number, began to strip, as we imagined to jump overboard; but it happened
                  otherwise. They immediately formed a resolution not to fly, but to fight; and when
                  the boat came up, they began the attack with their paddles, and with stones and
                  other offensive weapons that were in the boat, so vigorously, that we were obliged
                  to fire upon them in our own defence: four were unhappily killed, and the other
                  three who were boys, the eldest about nineteen, and the youngest about eleven,
                  instantly leaped into the water; <pb n="290"/> the eldest swam with great vigour,*
                  and resisted the attempts of our people to take him into the boat by every effort
                  that he could make: he was however at last overpowered, and the other two were
                  taken up with less difficulty. I am conscious that the feeling of every reader of
                  humanity will censure me for having fired upon these unhappy people, and it is
                  impossible that, upon a calm review, I should approve it myself. They certainly
                  did not deserve death for not chusing to confide in my promises; or not consenting
                  to come on board my boat, even if they had apprehended no danger; but the nature
                  of my service required me to obtain a knowlege of their country, which I could no
                  otherwise effect than by forcing my way into it in a hostile manner, or gaining
                  admission through the confidence and good-will of the people. I had already tried
                  the power of presents without effect; and I was now prompted, by my desire to
                  avoid further hostilities, to get some of them on board, as the only method left
                  of convincing them that we intended them no harm, and had it in our power to
                  contribute to their gratification and convenience. Thus far my intentions
                  certainly were not criminal; and though in the contest, which I had not the least
                  reason to expect, our victory might have been complete without so great an expence
                  of life; yet in such situations, when the command to fire has been given, no man
                  can restrain its excess, or prescribe its effect. </p><p n="546">As soon as the poor wretches whom we had taken out of the water were in
                  the boat, they squatted down, expecting no doubt instantly to be put to death: we
                  made haste to convince them of the contrary, by every method in our power; we
                  furnished them with clothes, and gave them every other testimony of kindness that
                  could remove their fears and engage their good-will. Those who are acquainted with
                  human nature will not wonder, that the sudden joy of these <pb n="291"/> young
                  savages at being unexpectedly delivered from the fear of death,* and kindly
                  treated by those whom they supposed would have been their instant executioners,
                  surmounted their concern for the friends they had lost, and was strongly expressed
                  in their countenances and behaviour. Before we reached the ship, their suspicions
                  and fears being wholly removed, they appeared to be not only reconciled to their
                  situation but in high spirits, and upon being offered some bread when they came on
                  board, they devoured it with a voracious appetite. They answered and asked many
                  questions, with great appearance of pleasure and curiosity; and when our dinner
                  came, they expressed an inclination to taste every thing that they saw: they
                  seemed best pleased with the salt pork, though we had other provisions upon the
                  table. At sun-set, they eat another meal with great eagerness, each devouring a
                  large quantity of bread, and drinking above a quart of water. We then made them
                  beds upon the lockers, and they went to sleep with great seeming content. In the
                  night, however, the tumult of their minds having subsided, and given way to
                  reflection, they sighed often and loud. Tupia, who was always upon the watch to
                  comfort them, got up, and by soothing and encouragement made them not only easy
                  but cheerful; their cheerfulness was encouraged so that they sung a song with a
                  degree of taste that surprised us: the tune was solemn and slow, like those of our
                  Psalms, containing many notes and semitones. Their countenances were intelligent
                  and expressive, and the middlemost, who seemed to be about fifteen, had an
                  openness in his aspect, and an ease in his deportment which were very striking: we
                  found that the two eldest were brothers, and that their names were TAAHOURANGE and
                  KOIKERANGE; the name of the youngest was MARAGOVETE. As we were returning to the
                  ship, after having taken these boys into the boat, we <pb n="292"/> picked up a
                  large piece of pummice stone floating upon the water;* a sure sign that there
                  either is, or has been a volcano in this neighbourhood. </p><p n="547">*In the morning, they all seemed to be cheerful, and eat another enormous
                  meal; after this we dressed them, and adorned them with bracelets, anclets, and
                  necklaces, after their own fashion, and the boat being hoisted out, they were told
                  that we were going to set them ashore: this produced a transport of joy; but upon
                  perceiving that we made towards our first landing-place near the river, their
                  countenances changed, and they entreated with great earnestness that they might
                  not be set ashore at that place, because they said, it was inhabited by their
                  enemies, who would kill them and eat them. This was a great disappointment to me;
                  because I hoped the report and appearance of the boys would procure a favourable
                  reception for ourselves. I had already sent an officer on shore with the marines
                  and a party of men to cut wood, and I was determined to land near the place; not
                  however to abandon the boys, if, when we got ashore, they should be unwilling to
                  leave us; but to send a boat with them in the evening to that part of the bay to
                  which they pointed, and which they called their home. Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander and
                  Tupia were with me, and upon our landing with the boys, and crossing the river,
                  they seemed at first to be unwilling to leave us; but at length they suddenly
                  changed their mind, and, though not without a manifest struggle, and some tears,
                  they took their leave: when they were gone, we proceeded along a swamp, with a
                  design to shoot some ducks, of which we saw great plenty, and four of the marines
                  attended us, walking abreast of us upon a bank that overlooked the country. After
                  we had advanced about a mile, these men called out to us and told us, that a large
                  body of the Indians was in sight, and advancing at a <pb n="293"/> great rate.
                  Upon receiving this intelligence,* we drew together, and resolved to make the best
                  of our way to the boats; we had scarcely begun to put this into execution, when
                  the three Indian boys started suddenly from some bushes, where they had concealed
                  themselves, and again claimed our protection: we readily received them, and
                  repairing to the beach as the clearest place, we walked briskly towards the boats.
                  The Indians were in two bodies; one ran along the bank which had been quitted by
                  the marines, the other fetched a compass by the swamp so that we could not see
                  them: when they perceived that we had formed into one body, they slackened their
                  pace; but still followed us in a gentle walk: that they slackened their pace, was
                  for us, as well as for them, a fortunate circumstance; for when we came to the
                  side of the river, where we expected to find the boats that were to carry us over
                  to the wooders, we found the pinnace at least a mile from her station, having been
                  sent to pick up a bird which had been shot by the officer on shore, and the little
                  boat was obliged to make three trips before we could all get over to the rest of
                  the party. As soon as we were drawn up on the other side, the Indians came down,
                  not in a body as we expected, but by two or three at a time, all armed, and in a
                  short time their number increased to about two hundred: as we now despaired of
                  making peace with them, seeing that the dread of our small arms did not keep them
                  at a distance, and that the ship was too far off to reach the place with a shot,
                  we resolved to re-imbark, lest our stay should imbroil us in another quarrel, and
                  cost more of the Indians their lives. We therefore advanced towards the pinnace
                  which was now returning, when one of the boys suddenly cried out, that his uncle
                  was among the people who had marched down to us, and desired us to stay and talk
                  with them: we complied, and a parley immediately commenced between <pb n="294"/>
                  them and Tupia;* during which the boys held up every thing we had given them as
                  tokens of our kindness and liberality; but neither would either of the boys swim
                  over to them, or any of them to the boys. The body of the man who had been killed
                  the day before, still lay exposed upon the beach; the boys seeing it lie very near
                  us, went up to it, and covered it with some of the clothes that we had given them;
                  and soon after a single man, unarmed, who proved to be the uncle of Maragovete,
                  the youngest of the boys, swam over to us, bringing in his hand a green branch,
                  which we supposed, as well here as at Otaheite, to be an emblem of peace. We
                  received his branch by the hands of Tupia, to whom he gave it, and made him many
                  presents; we also invited him to go on board the ship, but he declined it; we
                  therefore left him, and expected that his nephew, and the two other young Indians
                  would have staid with him, but to our great surprize, they chose rather to go with
                  us. As soon as we had retired, he went and gathered another green branch, and with
                  this in his hand, he approached the dead body which the youth had covered with
                  part of his clothes▪ walking sideways, with many ceremonies, and then throwing it
                  towards him. When this was done, he returned to his companions, who had sat down
                  upon the sand to observe the issue of his negotiation: they immediately gathered
                  round him, and continued in a body above an hour, without seeming to take any
                  farther notice of us. We were more curious than they, and observing them with our
                  glasses from on board the ship, we saw some of them cross the river upon a kind of
                  raft, or catamarine, and four of them carry off the dead body which had been
                  covered by the boy, and over which his uncle had performed the ceremony of the
                  branch, upon a kind of bier, between four men: the other body was still suffered
                  to remain where it had been first left. </p><p n="548"><pb n="295"/>After dinner, I directed Tupia to ask the boys,* if they had now any
                  objection to going ashore, where we had left their uncle, the body having been
                  carried off, which we understood was a ratification of peace: they said, they had
                  not; and the boat being ordered, they went into it with great alacrity: when the
                  boat, in which I had sent two midshipmen, came to land, they went willingly
                  ashore; but soon after she put off, they returned to the rocks, and wading into
                  the water, earnestly entreated to be taken on board again; but the people in the
                  boat, having positive orders to leave them, could not comply. We were very
                  attentive to what happened on shore, and keeping a constant watch with our
                  glasses, we saw a man pass the river upon another raft, and fetch them to a place
                  where forty or fifty of the natives were assembled, who closed round them, and
                  continued in the same place till sunset: upon looking again, when we saw them in
                  motion, we could plainly distinguish our three prisoners, who separated themselves
                  from the rest, came down to the beach, and having waved their hands three times
                  towards the ship, ran nimbly back and joined their companions, who walked
                  leisurely away towards that part which the boys had pointed to as their
                  dwelling-place; we had therefore the greatest reason to believe that no mischief
                  would happen to them, especially as we perceived that they went off in the clothes
                  we had given them. </p><p n="549">After it was dark, loud voices were heard on shore in the bottom of the
                  bay as usual, of which we could never learn the meaning. </p></div><pb n="296"/><div type="chapter" n="22"><head><l>CHAP.II.</l><l><emph rend="italic"> A Description of Poverty Bay, and the Face of the adjacent
                        Country. The Range from thence to Cape Turnagain, and back to Tolaga; with
                        some Account of the People and the Country, and several Incidents that
                        happened on that Part of the Coast.</emph></l></head><p n="550">*THE next morning, at six o'clock, we weighed, and stood away from this
                  unfortunate and inhospitable place, to which I gave the name of POVERTY BAY, and
                  which by the natives is called TAONEROA or Long Sand, as it did not afford us a
                  single article that we wanted except a little wood. It lies in latitude <geo select="lat" n="36">38°
                     42′ S</geo>. and longitude <geo select="lon" n="36">181° 36′ W</geo>.; it is in the form of an
                  horse-shoe, and is known by an island lying close under the north east point: the
                  two points which form the entrance are high, with steep white cliffs, and lie a
                  league and a half or two leagues from each other, N.E. by E. and S. W. by W.: the
                  depth of water in the bay is from twelve to five fathom, with a sandy bottom and
                  good anchorage; but the situation is open to the wind between the south and east:
                  boats can go in and out of the river at any time of the tide in fine weather; but
                  as there is a bar at the entrance, no boat can go either in or out when the sea
                  runs high: the best place to attempt it, is on the north east side, and it is
                  there practicable when it is not so in any other part. The shore of the bay, a
                  little within its entrance, is a low flat sand; behind which, at a small distance,
                  the face of the country is finely diversified by hills and valleys, all clothed
                     <pb n="297"/> with wood, and covered with verdure.* The country also appears to
                  be well inhabited, especially in the valleys leading up from the bay, where we
                  daily saw smoke rising in clouds one behind another to a great distance, till the
                  view terminated in mountains of a stupendous height. </p><p n="551">The south west point of the bay I named YOUNG NICK's HEAD, after Nicholas
                  Young, the boy who first saw the land; at noon, it bore N. W. by W. distant about
                  three or four leagues, and we were then about three miles from the shore. The main
                  land extended from N. E. by N. to south, and I proposed to follow the direction of
                  the coast to the southward as far as the latitude of 40 or 41; and then, if I met
                  with no encouragement to proceed farther, to return to the northward. </p><p n="552">In the afternoon we lay becalmed, which the people on shore perceiving,
                  several canoes put off, and came within less than a quarter of a mile of the
                  vessel; but could not be persuaded to come nearer, though Tupia exerted all the
                  powers of his lungs and his eloquence upon the occasion, shouting, and promising
                  that they should not be hurt. Another canoe was now seen coming from Poverty Bay,
                  with only four people on board, one of whom we well remembered to have seen in our
                  first interview upon the rock. This canoe, without stopping or taking the least
                  notice of the others, came directly alongside of the ship, and with very little
                  persuasion, we got the Indians on board. Their example was soon followed by the
                  rest, and we had about us seven canoes, and about fifty men. We made them all
                  presents with a liberal hand; notwithstanding which, they were so desirous to have
                  more of our commodities, that they sold us every thing they had, even the clothes
                  from their backs, and the paddles from their boats. There were but two weapons <pb n="298"/> among them,* these were the instruments of green talc, which were
                  shaped somewhat like a pointed battledore, with a short handle and sharp edges;
                  they were called Patoo-Patoo, and were well contrived for close-fighting, as they
                  would certainly split the thickest scull at a single blow. </p><p n="553">When these people had recovered from the first impressions of fear, which
                  notwithstanding their resolution in coming on board, had manifestly thrown them
                  into some confusion, we enquired after our poor boys. The man who first came on
                  board immediately answered, that they were unhurt and at home; adding, that he had
                  been induced to venture on board by the account which they had given him of the
                  kindness with which they had been treated, and the wonders that were contained in
                  the ship. </p><p n="554">While they were on board they shewed every sign of friendship, and invited
                  us very cordially to go back to our old bay, or to a small cove which they pointed
                  out, that was not quite so far off; but I chose rather to prosecute my discoveries
                  than go back, having reason to hope that I should find a better harbour than any I
                  had yet seen. </p><p n="555">About an hour before sun-set, the canoes put off from the ship with the
                  few paddles they had reserved, which were scarcely sufficient to set them on
                  shore; but by some means or other three of their people were left behind: as soon
                  as we discovered it, we hailed them; but not one of them would return to take them
                  on board: this greatly surprised us; but we were surprised still more to observe
                  that the deserted Indians did not seem at all uneasy at their situation, but
                  entertained us with dancing and singing after their manner, eat their suppers, and
                  went quietly to bed. </p><p n="556"><pb n="299"/>A light breeze springing up soon after it was dark,* we steered along
                  the shore under an easy sail till midnight, and then brought to, soon after which
                  it fell calm; we were now some leagues distant from the place where the canoes had
                  left us, and at day-break, when the Indians perceived it, they were seized with
                  consternation and terror, and lamented their situation in loud complaints, with
                  gestures of despair and many tears. Tupia, with great difficulty, pacified them;
                  and about seven o'clock in the morning,* a light breeze springing up, we continued
                  to stand south west along the shore. Fortunately for our poor Indians, two canoes
                  came off about this time, and made towards the ship: they stopped, however, at a
                  little distance, and seemed unwilling to trust themselves nearer. Our Indians were
                  greatly agitated in this state of uncertainty, and urged their fellows to come
                  alongside of the ship, both by their voice and gestures, with the utmost eagerness
                  and impatience. Tupia interpreted what they said, and we were much surprised to
                  find, that, among other arguments, they assured the people in the canoes, we did
                  not eat men. We now began seriously to believe that this horrid custom prevailed
                  among them; for what the boys had said, we considered as a mere hyperbolical
                  expression of their fear. One of the canoes, at length, ventured to come under the
                  ship's side; and an old man came on board, who seemed to be a Chief from the
                  finery of his garment, and the superiority of his weapon, which was a Patoo-Patoo,
                  made of bone, that, as he said, had belonged to a whale. He staid on board but a
                  short time, and when he went away, he took with him our guests, very much to the
                  satisfaction both of them and us. </p><p n="557">At the time when we sailed, we were abreast of a point, from which the
                  land trends S. S. W. and which, on account <pb n="300"/> of its figure,* I called
                  CAPE TABLE. This point lies seven leagues to the southward of Poverty Bay, in
                  latitude <geo select="lat" n="37">39° 7′ S</geo>. and longitude <geo select="lon" n="37">181° 36′ W</geo>.: it is of a
                  considerable height, makes in a sharp angle, and appears to be quite flat at the
                  top. </p><p n="558">In steering along the shore to the southward of the Cape, at the distance
                  of two or three miles, our soundings were from twenty to thirty fathom, having a
                  chain of rocks between us and the shore, which appeared at different heights above
                  the water. </p><p n="559">At noon, Cape Table bore N. 20 E. distant about four leagues, and a small
                  island, which was the southermost land in sight, bore S. 70 W. at the distance of
                  about three miles. This island, which the natives call TEAHOWRAY, I named the
                  ISLAND OF PORTLAND,* from its very great resemblance to Portland in the English
                  Channel: it lies about a mile from a point on the main; but there appears to be a
                  ridge of rocks, extending nearly, if not quite, from one to the other. N. 57 E.
                  two miles from the south point of Portland, lies a sunken rock, upon which the sea
                  breaks with great violence. We passed between this rock and the land, having from
                  seventeen to twenty fathom. </p><p n="560">In sailing along the shore, we saw the natives assembled in great numbers
                  as well upon Portland Island as the main: we could also distinguish several spots
                  of ground that were cultivated; some seemed to be fresh turned up, and lay in
                  furrows like ploughed land, and some had plants upon them in different stages of
                  their growth. We saw also in two places, high rails upon the ridges of hills, like
                  what we had seen upon the peninsula at the north east head of Poverty bay: as they
                  were ranged in lines only, and not so as to enclose <pb n="301"/> an area, we
                  could not guess at their use,* and therefore supposed they might be the work of
                  superstition. </p><p n="561">About noon another canoe appeared, in which were four men; she came within
                  about a quarter of a mile of us, where the people on board seemed to perform
                  divers ceremonies: one of them, who was in the bow, sometimes seemed to ask and to
                  offer peace, and sometimes to threaten war, by brandishing a weapon that he held
                  in his hand: sometimes also he danced, and sometimes he sung. Tupia talked much to
                  him, but could not persuade him to come to the ship. </p><p n="562">Between one and two o'clock we discovered land to the westward of
                  Portland, extending to the southward as far as we could see; and as the ship was
                  hauling round the south end of the island, she suddenly fell into shoal water and
                  broken ground: we had indeed always seven fathom or more, but the soundings were
                  never twice the same, jumping at once from seven fathom to eleven; in a short
                  time, however, we got clear of all danger, and had again deep water under us. </p><p n="563">At this time the island lay within a mile of us, making in white cliffs,
                  and a long spit of low land running from it towards the main. On the sides of
                  these cliffs sat vast numbers of people, looking at us with a fixed attention, and
                  it is probable that they perceived some appearance of hurry and confusion on
                  board, and some irregularity in the working of the ship, while we were getting
                  clear of the shallow water and broken ground, from which they might infer that we
                  were alarmed or in distress; we thought that they wished to take advantage of our
                  situation, for five canoes were put off with the utmost expedition, full of men,
                  and well armed: they came so near, and shewed so hostile a disposition by
                  shouting, brandishing their lances, and using threatening <pb n="302"/> gestures,*
                  that we were in some pain for our small boat, which was still employed in
                  sounding: a musket was therefore fired over them, but finding it did them no harm,
                  they seemed rather to be provoked than intimidated, and I therefore fired a four
                  pounder, charged with grape-shot, wide of them: this had a better effect; upon the
                  report of the piece they all rose up and shouted, but instead of continuing the
                  chace, drew altogether, and after a short consultation, went quietly away. </p><p n="564">Having got round Portland, we hauled in for the land N. W. having a gentle
                  breeze at N. E. which about five o'clock died away, and obliged us to anchor; we
                  had one and twenty fathom, with a fine sandy bottom: the south point of Portland
                  bore S. E. ½ S. distant about two leagues, and a low point on the main bore N. ½
                  E.: in the same direction with this low point, there runs a deep bay, behind the
                  land of which Cape Table is the extremity, so as to make this land a peninsula,
                  leaving only a low narrow neck between that and the main. Of this peninsula, which
                  the natives call TERAKACO, Cape Table is the north point, and Portland the south. </p><p n="565">While we lay at anchor, two more canoes came off to us, one armed, and the
                  other a small fishing-boat, with only four men in her; they came so near that they
                  entered into conversation with Tupia; they answered all the questions that he
                  asked them with great civility, but could not be persuaded to come on board; they
                  came near enough, however, to receive several presents that were thrown to them
                  from the ship, with which they seemed much pleased, and went away. During the
                  night many fires were kept upon shore, probably to shew us that the inhabitants
                  were too much upon their guard to be surprized. </p><p n="566"><pb n="303"/>About five o'clock in the morning of the <date>13th</date>,* a breeze springing up
                  northerly, we weighed, and steered in for the land. The shore here forms a large
                  bay, of which Portland is the north east point, and the bay that runs behind Cape
                  Table an arm. This arm I had a great inclination to examine, because there
                  appeared to be safe anchorage in it, but not being sure of that, and the wind
                  being right an end, I was unwilling to spare the time. Four and twenty fathom was
                  the greatest depth within Portland, but the ground was every where clear. The land
                  near the shore is of a moderate height, with white cliffs and sandy beaches;
                  within, it rises into mountains, and upon the whole the surface is hilly, for the
                  most part covered with wood, and to appearance pleasant and fertile. In the
                  morning nine canoes came after the ship, but whether with peaceable or hostile
                  intentions we could not tell, for we soon left them behind us. </p><p n="567">In the evening we stood in for a place that had the appearance of an
                  opening, but found no harbour; we therefore stood out again, and were soon
                  followed by a large canoe, with eighteen or twenty men, all armed, who, though
                  they could not reach us, shouted defiance, and brandished their weapons, with many
                  gestures of menace and insult. </p><p n="568">In the morning we had a view of the mountains inland,* upon which the snow
                  was still lying: the country near the shore was low and unfit for culture, but in
                  one place we perceived a patch of somewhat yellow, which had greatly the
                  appearance of a corn field, yet was probably nothing more than some dead flaggs,
                  which are not uncommon in swampy places: at some distance we saw groves of trees,
                  which appeared high and tapering, and being not above two leagues from the south
                  well cod of the great bay, in which we had been coasting for the two last days, I
                  hoisted out the pinnace <pb n="304"/> and long-boat to search for fresh water;*
                  but just as they were about to put off, we saw several boats full of people coming
                  from the shore, and therefore I did not think it safe for them to leave the ship.
                  About ten o'clock, five of these boats having drawn together, as if to hold a
                  consultation, made towards the ship, having on board between eighty and ninety
                  men, and four more followed at some distance, as if to sustain the attack: when
                  the first five came within about a hundred yards of the ship, they began to sing
                  their war song, and brandishing their pikes, prepared for an engagement. We had
                  now no time to lose, for if we could not prevent the attack, we should come under
                  the unhappy necessity of using our fire-arms against them, which we were very
                  desirous to avoid. Tupia was therefore ordered to acquaint them that we had
                  weapons which, like thunder, would destroy them in a moment; that we would
                  immediately convince them of their power by directing their effect so that they
                  should not be hurt; but that if they persisted in any hostile attempt, we should
                  be obliged to use them for our defence: a four pounder, loaded with grape-shot,
                  was then discharged wide of them, which produced the desired effect; the report,
                  the flash, and above all, the shot, which spread very far in the water, so
                  intimidated them, that they began to paddle away with all their might: Tupia,
                  however, calling after them, and assuring them that if they would come unarmed,
                  they should be kindly received; the people in one of the boats put their arms on
                  board of another, and came under the ship's stern; we made them several presents,
                  and should certainly have prevailed upon them to come on board, if the other
                  canoes had not come up, and again threatened us, by shouting and brandishing their
                  weapons: at this the people who had come to the ship unarmed, expressed great
                  displeasure, and soon after they all went away. </p><p n="569"><pb n="305"/>In the afternoon we stood over to the south point of the bay, but not
                  reaching it before it was dark,* we stood off and on all night. At eight the next
                  morning, being a-breast of the point, several fishing boats came off to us, and
                  sold us some stinking fish: it was the best they had, and we were willing to trade
                  with them upon any terms: these people behaved very well, and we should have
                  parted good friends if it had not been for a large canoe, with two and twenty
                  armed men on board, which came boldly up along side of the ship. We soon saw that
                  this boat had nothing for traffick, yet we gave them two or three pieces of cloth,
                  an article which they seemed very fond of. I observed that one man had a black
                  skin thrown over him, somewhat resembling that of a bear, and being desirous to
                  know what animal was its first owner, I offered him for it a piece of red baize,
                  and he seemed greatly pleased with the bargain, immediately pulling off the skin,
                  and holding it up in the boat; he would not, however, part with it till he had the
                  cloth in his possession, and as there could be no transfer of property, if with
                  equal caution I had insisted upon the same condition, I ordered the cloth to be
                  handed down to him, upon which, with amazing coolness, instead of sending up the
                  skin, he began to pack up both that and the baize, which he had received as the
                  purchase of it, in a basket, without paying the least regard to my demand or
                  remonstrances, and soon after, with the fishing boats, put off from the ship; when
                  they were at some distance, they drew together, and after a short consultation
                  returned; the fishermen offered more fish, which, though good for nothing, was
                  purchased, and trade was again renewed. Among others who were placed over the
                  ship's side to hand up what we bought, was little Tayeto, Tupia's boy; and one of
                  the Indians, watching his opportunity, suddenly seized him, and dragged him <pb n="306"/> down into the canoe;* two of them held him down in the fore part of
                  it, and the others, with great activity, paddled her off, the rest of the canoes
                  following as fast as they could: upon this the marines, who were under arms upon
                  deck, were ordered to fire. The shot was directed to that part of the canoe which
                  was farthest from the boy, and rather wide of her, being willing rather to miss
                  the rowers than to hurt him: it happened, however, that one man dropped, upon
                  which the others quitted their hold of the boy, who instantly leaped into the
                  water, and swam towards the ship; the large canoe immediately pulled round and
                  followed him, but some musquets, and a great gun being fired at her, she desisted
                  from the pursuit. The ship being brought to, a boat was lowered, and the poor boy
                  taken up unhurt, though so terrified that for a time he seemed to be deprived of
                  his senses. Some of the gentlemen who traced the canoes to shore with their
                  glasses, said, that they saw three men carried up the beach, who appeared to be
                  either dead or wholly disabled by their wounds. </p><p n="570">To the cape off which this unhappy transaction happened, I gave the name
                  of CAPE KIDNAPPERS. It lies in latitude <geo select="lat" n="38">39° 43′</geo>, and longitude
                  <geo select="lon" n="38">182° 24′ W</geo>. and is rendered remarkable by two white rocks like hay
                  stacks, and the high white cliffs on each side. It lies S. W. by W. distant
                  thirteen leagues from the isle of Portland; and between them is the bay of which
                  it is the south point, and which, in honour of Sir Edward Hawke, then First Lord
                  of the Admiralty, I called HAWKE's BAY.* We found in it from twenty-four to seven
                  fathom, and good anchorage. From Cape Kidnappers the land trends S. S. W. and in
                  this direction we made our run along the shore, keeping at about a league
                  distance, with a steady breeze and clear weather. </p><p n="571"><pb n="307"/>As soon as Tayeto recovered from his fright,* he brought a fish to
                  Tupia, and told him, that he intended it as an offering to his Eatua, or god, in
                  gratitude for his escape; Tupia commended his piety, and ordered him to throw the
                  fish into the sea, which was accordingly done. </p><p n="572">About two o'clock in the afternoon, we passed a small but high white
                  island, lying close to the shore, upon which we saw many houses, boats, and
                  people. The people we concluded to be fishers, because the island was totally
                  barren; we saw several people also on shore, in a small bay upon the main, within
                  the island. At eleven,* we brought to till day-light, and then made sail to the
                  southward, along the shore. About seven o'clock we past a high point of land,
                  which lies S. S. W. twelve leagues from Cape Kidnappers: from this point the land
                  trends three-fourths of a point more to the westward; at ten, we saw more land
                  open to the southward, and at noon, the southermost land that was in sight, bore
                  S. 39 W. distant eight or ten leagues, and a high bluff head, with yellowish
                  cliffs, bore W. distant about two miles: the depth of water was thirty-two fathom. </p><p n="573">In the afternoon we had a fresh breeze at west, and during the night
                  variable light airs and calms:* in the morning a gentle breeze sprung up between
                  the N. W. and N. E. and having till now stood to the southward, without seeing any
                  probability of meeting with a harbour, and the country manifestly altering for the
                  worse, I thought that standing farther in that direction would be attended with no
                  advantage, but on the contrary would be a loss of time that might be employed with
                  a better prospect of success in examining the coast to the northward; about one,
                  therefore, in the afternoon, I tacked, and stood north, with a fresh breeze at
                  west. The high bluff head, with yellowish cliffs, which we were <pb n="308"/>
                  a-breast of at noon,* I called CAPE TURNAGAIN, because here we turned back. It
                  lies in latitude <geo select="lat" n="39">40° 34′ S</geo>. longitude <geo select="lon" n="39">182° 55′ W</geo>. distant
                  eighteen leagues S. S. W. and S. S. W. ½ W. from Cape Kidnappers. The land between
                  them is of a very unequal height; in some places it is lofty next the sea with
                  white cliffs, in others low, with sandy beaches: the face of the country is not so
                  well clothed with wood as it is about Hawke's bay, but looks more like our high
                  downs in England: it is, however, to all appearance, well inhabited, for as we
                  stood along the shore, we saw several villages, not only in the vallies, but on
                  the tops and sides of the hills, and smoke in many other places. The ridge of
                  mountains which has been mentioned before, extends to the southward farther than
                  we could see, and was then every where chequered with snow. At night we saw two
                  fires inland, so very large, that we concluded they must have been made to clear
                  the land for tillage; but however that be, they are a demonstration that the part
                  of the country where they appeared is inhabited. </p><p n="574">*On the <date>18th</date>, at four o'clock in the morning, Cape Kidnappers bore N. 32
                  W. distant two leagues: in this situation we had sixty-two fathom, and when the
                  Cape bore W. by N. distant three or four leagues, we had forty-five fathom: in the
                  mid-way between the isle of Portland and the Cape we had sixty-five fathom. In the
                  evening, being a-breast of the peninsula within Portland island, called TERAKAKO,*
                  a canoe came off from that shore, and with much difficulty overtook the ship;
                  there were on board five people, two of whom appeared to be Chiefs, and the other
                  three servants: the Chiefs, with very little invitation came on board, and ordered
                  the rest to remain in their canoe. We treated them with great kindness, and they
                  were not backward in expressing <pb n="309"/> their satisfaction; they went down
                  into the cabbin,* and after a short time told us that they had determined not to
                  go on shore till the next morning. As the sleeping on board was an honour which we
                  neither expected nor desired, I remonstrated strongly against it, and told them,
                  that on their account it would not be proper, as the ship would probably be at a
                  great distance from where she was then, the next morning: they persisted, however,
                  in their resolution, and as I found it impossible to get rid of them without
                  turning them by force out of the ship, I complied: as a proper precaution,
                  however, I proposed to take their servants also on board, and hoist their canoe
                  into the ship; they made no objection, and this was accordingly done. The
                  countenance of one of these Chiefs was the most open and ingenuous of all I have
                  ever seen, and I very soon gave up every suspicion of his having any sinister
                  design: they both examined every thing they saw with great curiosity and
                  attention, and received very thankfully such little presents as we made them;
                  neither of them, however, could be persuaded either to eat or drink, but their
                  servants devoured every thing they could get with great voracity. We found that
                  these men had heard of our kindness and liberality to the natives who had been on
                  board before, yet we thought the confidence they placed in us, an extraordinary
                  instance of their fortitude. At night I brought to till day-light, and then made
                  sail;* at seven in the morning, I brought to again under Cape Table, and sent away
                  our guests with their canoe, who expressed some surprise at seeing themselves so
                  far from home, but landed a-breast of the ship. At this time I saw other canoes
                  putting off from the shore, but I stood away to the northward without waiting for
                  their coming up. </p><p n="575">About three, I passed a remarkable head land, which I called
                  GABLE-END-FORELAND, from the very great likeness <pb n="310"/> of the white cliff
                  at the point,* to the gable-end of a house: it is not more remarkable for its
                  figure, than for a rock which rises like a spire at a little distance. It lies
                  from Cape Table N. 24 E. distant about twelve leagues. The shore between them
                  forms a bay, within which lies Poverty bay, at the distance of four leagues from
                  the head land, and eight from the Cape. At this place three canoes came off to us,
                  and one man came on board; we gave him some trifles, and he soon returned to his
                  boat, which, with all the rest, dropped a-stern. </p><p n="576">*In the morning I made sail in shore, in order to look into two bays,
                  which appeared about two leagues to the northward of the Foreland; the southermost
                  I could not fetch, but I anchored in the other about eleven o'clock. </p><p n="577">Into this bay we were invited by the people on board many canoes, who
                  pointed to a place where they said there was plenty of fresh water: I did not find
                  so good a shelter from the sea as I expected, but the natives who came about us,
                  appearing to be of a friendly disposition, I was determined to try whether I could
                  not get some knowlege of the country here before I proceeded farther to the
                  northward. </p><p n="578">In one of the canoes that came about us as soon as we anchored, we saw two
                  men, who by their habits appeared to be Chiefs: one of them was dressed in a
                  jacket, which was ornamented, after their manner, with dog's skin; the jacket of
                  the other was almost covered with small tufts of red feathers. These men I invited
                  on board, and they entered the ship with very little hesitation: I gave each of
                  them about four yards of linen, and a spike nail; with the linen they were much
                  pleased, but seemed to set no value upon the nail. We perceived that they knew
                  what had happened in Poverty bay, and we had therefore no reason to doubt but that
                  they would <pb n="311"/> behave peaceably; however, for further security,* Tupia
                  was ordered to tell them for what purpose we came thither, and to assure them that
                  we would offer them no injury, if they offered none to us. In the mean time those
                  who remained in the canoes traded with our people very fairly for what they
                  happened to have with them: the Chiefs, who were old men, staid with us till we
                  had dined, and about two o'clock I put off with the boats, manned and armed, in
                  order to go on shore in search of water, and the two Chiefs went into the boat
                  with me. The afternoon was tempestuous, with much rain, and the surf every where
                  ran so high, that although we rowed almost round the bay, we found no place where
                  we could land: I determined therefore to return to the ship, which being intimated
                  to the Chiefs, they called to the people on shore, and ordered a canoe to be sent
                  off for themselves; this was accordingly done, and they left us, promising to come
                  on board again in the morning, and bring us some fish and sweet potatoes. </p><p n="579">In the evening, the weather having become fair and moderate, the boats
                  were again ordered out, and I landed, accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander.
                  We were received with great expressions of friendship by the natives, who behaved
                  with a scrupulous attention not to give offence. In particular, they took care not
                  to appear in great bodies: one family, or the inhabitants of two or three houses
                  only, were generally placed together, to the number of fifteen or twenty,
                  consisting of men, women, and children. These little companies sat upon the
                  ground, not advancing towards us, but inviting us to them, by a kind of beckon,
                  moving one hand towards the breast. We made them several little presents; and in
                  our walk round the bay found two small streams of fresh water. This convenience,
                  and the friendly behaviour of the people, determined me to stay at least a <pb n="312"/> day,* that I might fill some of my empty casks, and give Mr. Banks an
                  opportunity of examining the natural produce of the country. </p><p n="580">*In the morning of the <date>21st</date>, I sent Lieutenant Gore on shore, to
                  superintend the watering, with a strong party of men; and they were soon followed
                  by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, with Tupia, Tayeto, and four others. </p><p n="581">The natives sat by our people, and seemed pleased to observe them; but did
                  not intermix with them: they traded however, chiefly for cloth, and after a short
                  time applied to their ordinary occupations, as if no stranger had been among them.
                  In the forenoon, several of their boats went out a fishing, and at dinner time
                  every one repaired to his respective dwelling; from which, after a certain time,
                  he returned. These fair appearances encouraged Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander to range
                  the bay with very little precaution, where they found many plants, and shot some
                  birds of exquisite beauty. In their walk, they visited several houses of the
                  natives, and saw something of their manner of life; for they showed, without any
                  reserve, every thing which the Gentlemen desired to see. They were sometimes found
                  at their meals, which the approach of the strangers never interrupted. Their food
                  at this season consisted of fish, with which, instead of bread, they eat the root
                  of a kind of fern, very like that which grows upon our commons in England. These
                  roots they scorch over the fire, and then beat with a stick, till the bank and dry
                  outside fall off; what remains is a soft substance, somewhat clammy and sweet, not
                  unpleasing to the taste, but mixed with three or four times its quantity of
                  strings and fibres, which are very disagreeable; these were swallowed by some, but
                  spit out by the far greater number, who had baskets under them to receive the
                  rejected <pb n="313"/> part of what had been chewed,* which had an appearance very
                  like that of tobacco in the same state. In other seasons they have certainly
                  plenty of excellent vegetables; but no tame animals were seen among them except
                  dogs, which were very small and ugly. Mr. Banks saw some of their plantations,
                  where the ground was as well broken down and tilled as even in the gardens of the
                  most curious people among us: in these spots were sweet potatoes, coccos or eddas,
                  which are well known and much esteemed both in the East and West Indies, and some
                  gourds: the sweet potatoes were planted in small hills, some ranged in rows, and
                  others in quincunx, all laid by a line with the greatest regularity: the coccos
                  were planted upon flat land, but none of them yet appeared above ground; and the
                  gourds were set in small hollows, or dishes, much as in England. These plantations
                  were of different extent, from one or two acres to ten: taken together, there
                  appeared to be from 150 to 200 acres in cultivation in the whole bay, though we
                  never saw an hundred people. Each district was fenced in, generally with reeds,
                  which were placed so close together that there was scarcely room for a mouse to
                  creep between. </p><p n="582">The women were plain, and made themselves more so by painting their faces
                  with red ocre and oil, which being generally fresh and wet upon their cheeks and
                  foreheads, was easily transferred to the noses of those who thought fit to salute
                  them; and that they were not wholly averse to such familiarity, the noses of
                  several of our people strongly testified: they were, however, as great coquets as
                  any of the most fashionable ladies in Europe, and the young ones as skittish as an
                  unbroken filly: each of them wore a petticoat, under which there was a girdle,
                  made of the blades of grass highly perfumed, and to the girdle was fastened a
                  small bunch of the leaves of some fragrant plant, which served <pb n="314"/> their
                  modesty as its innermost veil.* The faces of the men were not so generally
                  painted, yet we saw one whose whole body, and even his garments, were rubbed over
                  with dry ocre, of which he kept a piece constantly in his hand, and was every
                  minute renewing the decoration in one part or another, where he supposed it was
                  become deficient. In personal delicacy they were not equal to our friends at
                  Otaheite, for the coldness of the climate did not invite them so often to bathe;
                  but we saw among them one instance of cleanliness in which they exceeded them, and
                  of which perhaps there is no example in any other Indian nation. Every house, or
                  every little cluster of three or four houses, was furnished with a privy, so that
                  the ground was every where clean. The offals of their food, and other litter, were
                  also piled up in regular dunghills, which probably they made use of at a proper
                  time for manure. </p><p n="583">In this decent article of civil oeconomy they were beforehand with one of
                  the most considerable nations of Europe, for I am credibly informed, that, till
                  the year 1760, there was no such thing as a privy in Madrid, the metropolis of
                  Spain, though it is plentifully supplied with water. Before that time it was the
                  universal practice to throw the ordure out of the windows, during the night, into
                  the street, where numbers of men were employed to remove it, with shovels, from
                  the upper parts of the city to the lower, where it lay till it was dry, and was
                  then carried away in carts, and deposited without the gates. His present Catholic
                  Majesty, having determined to free his capital from so gross a nuisance, ordered,
                  by proclamation, that the proprietor of every house should build a privy, and that
                  sinks, drains, and common-sewers should be made at the public expence. The
                  Spaniards, though long accustomed to an arbitrary government, resented this
                  proclamation with great spirit, as an infringement <pb n="315"/> of the common
                  rights of mankind,* and made a vigorous struggle against its being carried into
                  execution. Every class devised some objection against it, but the physicians bid
                  the fairest to interest the king in the preservation of the ancient privileges of
                  his people; for they remonstrated that if the filth was not, as usual, thrown into
                  the streets, a fatal sickness would probably ensue, because the putrescent
                  particles of the air, which such filth attracted, would then be imbibed by the
                  human body. But this expedient, with every other that could be thought of, proved
                  unsuccessful, and the popular discontent then ran so high that it was very near
                  producing an insurrection; his majesty, however, at length prevailed, and Madrid
                  is now as clear as most of the considerable cities in Europe. But many of the
                  citizens, probably upon the principles advanced by their physicians, that heaps of
                  filth prevent deleterious particles of air from fixing upon neighbouring
                  substances, have, to keep their food wholesome, constructed their privies by the
                  kitchen fire. </p><p n="584">In the evening, all our boats being employed in carrying the water on
                  board, and Mr. Banks and his company finding it probable that they should be left
                  on shore after it was dark, by which much time would be lost, which they were
                  impatient to employ in putting the plants they had gathered in order, they applied
                  to the Indians for a passage in one of their canoes: they immediately consented,
                  and a canoe was launched for their use. They went all on board, being eight in
                  number, but not being used to a vessel that required so even a balance, they
                  unfortunately overset her in the surf: no life however was lost, but it was
                  thought advisable that half of them should wait for another turn. Mr. Banks, Dr.
                  Solander, Tupia, and Tayeto embarked again, and without any farther accident
                  arrived safely at the ship, well pleased with the good-nature of their Indian
                  friends, who cheerfully <pb n="316"/> understook to carry them a second time,*
                  after having experienced how unfit a freight they were for such a vessel. </p><p n="585">While these gentlemen were on shore, several of the natives went off to
                  the ship, and trafficked, by exchanging their cloth for that of Otaheite: of this
                  barter they were for some time very fond, preferring the Indian cloth to that of
                  Europe; but before night it decreased in its value five hundred per cent. Many of
                  these Indians I took on board, and shewed them the ship and her apparatus, at
                  which they expressed equal satisfaction and astonishment. </p><p n="586">As I found it exceedingly difficult to get water on board on account of
                  the surf, I determined to stay no longer at this place;* on the next morning
                  therefore, about five o'clock, I weighed anchor and put to sea. </p><p n="587">This bay, which is called by the natives TEGADOO, lies in the latitude of
                  <geo select="lat">38° 10′ S</geo>., but as it has nothing to recommend it, a description of
                  it is unnecessary. </p><p n="588">From this bay I intended to stand on to the northward, but the wind being
                  right against me, I could make no way. While I was beating about to windward, some
                  of the natives came on board, and told me, that in a bay which lay a little to the
                  southward, being the same that I could not fetch the day I put into Tegadoo, there
                  was excellent water, where the boats might land without a surf. I thought it
                  better therefore to put into this bay, where I might complete my water, and form
                  farther connexions with the Indians, than to keep the sea. With this view I bore
                  up for it, and sent in two boats, manned and armed, to examine the watering-place,
                  who confirming the report of the Indians at their return, I came to an anchor
                  about one o'clock, in eleven fathom water, with a fine sandy bottom, the north
                  point of the bay N. by E. and the south point S. E. The watering-place, <pb n="317"/> which was in a small cove a little within the south point of the bay,
                  bore S. by E. distant about a mile.* Many canoes came immediately off from the
                  shore, and all traded very honestly for Otaheite cloth and glass bottles, of which
                  they were immoderately fond. </p><p n="589">In the afternoon of the <date>23d</date>, as soon as the ship was moored,* I went on
                  shore to examine the watering-place, accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander:
                  the boat landed in the cove, without the least surf; the water was excellent, and
                  conveniently situated; there was plenty of wood close to high-water mark, and the
                  disposition of the people was in every respect such as we could wish. </p><p n="590">Having, with Mr. Green, taken several observations of the sun and moon,
                  the mean result of them gave <geo select="lon">180° 47′ W</geo>. longitude; but, as all the
                  observations made before exceeded these, I have laid down the coast from the mean
                  of the whole. At noon, I took the sun's meridian altitude with an astronomical
                  quadrant, which was set up at the watering-place, and found the latitude to be
                  <geo select="lat">38° 22′ 24″</geo>. </p><p n="591">On the <date>24th</date>, early in the morning,* I sent Lieutenant Gore on shore, to
                  superintend the cutting of wood and filling of water, with a sufficient number of
                  men for both purposes, and all the marines as a guard. After breakfast, I went on
                  shore myself, and continued there the whole day. </p><p n="592">Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander also went on shore to gather plants, and in
                  their walks saw several things worthy of notice. They met with many houses in the
                  vallies that seemed to be wholly deserted, the people living on the ridges of the
                  hills in a kind of sheds very slightly built. As they were advancing in one of
                  these vallies, the hills on each side of which were very steep, they were suddenly
                  struck with the fight of a very extraordinary natural curiosity. It was a rock,
                     <pb n="318"/> perforated through its whole substance,* so as to form a rude but
                  stupendous arch or cavern, opening directly to the sea; this aperture was
                  seventy-five feet long, twenty-seven broad, and five and forty high, commanding a
                  view of the bay and the hills on the other side, which were seen through it, and,
                  opening at once upon the view, produced an effect far superior to any of the
                  contrivances of art. </p><p n="593">As they were returning to the watering-place in the evening they met an
                  old man, who detained them some time by showing them the military exercises of the
                  country with the lance and Patoo-Patoo, which are all the weapons in use. The
                  lance is from ten to fourteen feet long, made of a very hard wood, and sharp at
                  both ends: the Patoo-Patoo has been described already, it is about a foot long,
                  made of Talc or bone, with sharp edges, and used as a battle-axe. A post or stake
                  was set up as his enemy, to which he advanced with a most furious aspect,
                  brandishing his lance, which he grasped with great firmness; when it was supposed
                  to have been pierced by his lance, he ran at it with his Patoo-Patoo, and falling
                  upon the upper end of it, which was to represent his adversary's head, he laid on
                  with great vehemence, striking many blows, any one of which would probably have
                  split the scull of an ox. From our champion's falling upon his mock enemy with the
                  Patoo-Patoo, after he was supposed to have been pierced with the lance, our
                  Gentlemen inferred, that in the battles of this country there is no quarter. </p><p n="594">This afternoon, we set up the armourer's forge, to repair the braces of
                  the tiller which had been broken, and went on getting our wood and water, without
                  suffering the least molestation from the natives; who came down with different
                  sorts of fish, which we purchased with cloth, beads, and glass bottles, as usual. </p><p n="595"><!--Page  [unnumbered]--></p><p n="596">[illustration] <pb n="319"/>On the <date>25th</date>,* Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander went
                  again on shore; and while they were searching for plants, Tupia staid with the
                  waterers: among other Indians who came down to them, was a priest, with whom Tupia
                  entered into a very learned conversation. In their notions of religion they seemed
                  to agree very well, which is not often the case between learned divines on our
                  side of the ocean: Tupia, however, seemed to have the most knowlege, and he was
                  listened to with great deference and attention by the other. In the course of this
                  conversation, after the important points of divinity had been settled, Tupia
                  enquired if it was their practice to eat men, to which they answered in the
                  affirmative; but said that they eat only their enemies who were slain in battle. </p><p n="597">On the <date>26th</date>, it rained all day,* so that none of us could go ashore; and
                  very few of the Indians came either to the watering-place or the ship. </p><p n="598">On the <date>27th</date>,* I went with Dr. Solander to examine the bottom of the bay;
                  but though we went ashore at two places, we met with little worth notice. The
                  people behaved very civilly, shewing us every thing that we expressed a desire to
                  see. Among other trifling curiosities which Dr. Solander purchased of them, was a
                  boy's top, shaped exactly like those which children play with in England; and they
                  made signs, that to make it spin it was to be whipped. Mr. Banks in the mean time
                  went ashore at the watering-place, and climbed a hill which stood at a little
                  distance to see a fence of poles, which we had observed from the ship, and which
                  had been much the subject of speculation. The hill was extremely steep, and
                  rendered almost inaccessible by wood; yet he reached the place, near which he
                  found many houses that for some reason had been deserted by their inhabitants. <pb n="320"/> The poles appeared to be about sixteen feet high;* they were placed
                  in two rows, with a space of about six feet between them, and the poles in each
                  row were about ten feet distant from each other. The lane between them was covered
                  by sticks, that were set up sloping towards each other from the top of the poles
                  on each side, like the roof of a house. This rail-work, with a ditch that was
                  parallel to it, was carried about a hundred yards down the hill in a kind of
                  curve; but for what purpose we could not guess. </p><p n="599">The Indians, at the watering-place, at our request, entertained us with
                  their war-song, in which the women joined, with the most horrid distortions of
                  countenance, rolling their eyes, thrusting out their tongues, and often heaving
                  loud and deep sighs; though all was done in very good time. </p><p n="600">*On the <date>28th</date>, we went ashore upon an island that lies to the left hand of
                  the entrance of the bay, where we saw the largest canoe that we had yet met with:
                  she was sixty-eight feet and a half long, five broad, and three feet six high; she
                  had a sharp bottom, consisting of three trunks of trees hollowed, of which that in
                  the middle was the longest: the side planks were sixty-two feet long in one piece,
                  and were not despicably carved in bas relief; the head also was adorned with
                  carving still more richly. Upon this island there was a larger house than any we
                  had yet seen; but it seemed unfinished and was full of chips. The wood work was
                  squared so even and smooth, that we made no doubt of their having among them very
                  sharp tools. The sides of the posts were carved in a masterly stile, though after
                  their whimsical taste, which seems to prefer spiral lines and distorted faces: as
                  these carved posts appeared to have been brought from some other place, such work
                  is probably of great value among them. </p><p n="601"><pb n="321"/>At four o'clock in the morning of the <date>29th</date>,* having got on board our
                  wood and water, and a large supply of excellent celery, with which the country
                  abounds, and which proved a powerful antiscorbutic, I unmoored and put to sea. </p><p n="602">This bay is called by the natives TOLAGA; it is moderately large, and has
                  from seven to thirteen fathom, with a clean sandy bottom and good anchorage; and
                  is sheltered from all winds except the north east. It lies in latitude <geo select="lat">38°
                     22′ S</geo>. and four leagues and an half to the north of Gable-end Foreland.
                  On the south point lies a small but high island, so near the main as not to be
                  distinguished from it. Close to the north end of the island, at the entrance into
                  the bay, are two high rocks; one is round like a corn-stack, but the other is
                  long, and perforated in several places so that the openings appear like the arches
                  of a bridge. Within these rocks is the cove where we cut wood, and filled our
                  water-casks. Off the north point of the bay is a pretty high rocky island; and
                  about a mile without it, are some rocks and breakers. The variation of the compass
                  here is <geo select="lon">14° 31′ E</geo>. and the tide flows at the full and change of the
                  moon, about six o'clock, and rises and falls perpendicularly from five to six
                  feet: whether the flood comes from the southward or the northward I have not been
                  able to determine. </p><p n="603">We got nothing here by traffic but a few fish, and some sweet potatoes,
                  except a few trifles, which we considered merely as curiosities. We saw no
                  four-footed animals, nor the appearance of any, either tame or wild, except dogs
                  and rats, and these were very scarce: the people eat the dogs, like our friends at
                  Otaheite; and adorn their garments with the skins, as we do ours with fur and
                  ermine. I climbed many of the hills, hoping to get a view of the country, but I
                  could see nothing from the top except higher <pb n="322"/> hills,* in a boundless
                  succession. The ridges of these hills produce little besides fern; but the sides
                  are most luxuriantly clothed with wood, and verdure of various kinds, with little
                  plantations intermixed. In the woods, we found trees of above twenty different
                  sorts, and carried specimens of each on board; but there was no body among us to
                  whom they were not altogether unknown. The tree which we cut for firing was
                  somewhat like our maple, and yielded a whitish gum. We found another sort of it of
                  a deep yellow, which we thought might be useful in dying. We found also one
                  cabbage tree, which we cut down for the cabbages. The country abounds with plants,
                  and the woods with birds, in an endless variety, exquisitely beautiful, and of
                  which none of us had the least knowlege. The soil both of the hills and valleys is
                  light and sandy, and very fit for the production of all kinds of roots; though we
                  saw none except sweet potatoes and yams. </p><p n="604"><!--Page  [unnumbered]--></p><list type="simple"><item>[illustration] RIVER THAMES and MERCURY BAY in NEW ZEALAND</item><item>EXPLANATION</item><item>Parts unexplored</item><item>Rocks above Water</item><item>Rocks under Water</item><item>The prick'd line shews the Shps Track, and the figures the depth of Water in

                  sail again to the northward for about ten hours, with a light breeze, I hauled
                  round a small island which lay east one mile from the north east point of the
                  land: from this place I found the land trend away N.W. by W. and W. N. W. as far
                  as I could see, this point being the eastermost land on the whole coast. I gave it
                  the name of EAST CAPE, and I called the island that lies off it EAST ISLAND; it is
                  of a small circuit, high and round, and appears white and barren: the Cape is
                  high, with white cliffs, and lies in latitude <geo select="lat" n="40">37° 42′ 30″ S.</geo> and
                  longitude <geo select="lon" n="40">181° W</geo>. The land from Tolaga Bay to East Cape is of a
                  moderate, but unequal height, forming several small bays, in which are sandy
                  beaches: of the inland country we could not see much, the weather being cloudy and
                  hazey. The soundings were from twenty to thirty fathom at the distance of about a
                  league from the shore. After we had rounded the Cape, we saw in our run along the
                  shore a great number of villages, and much cultivated land; the country in general
                  appeared more fertile than before, and was low near the sea, but hilly within. At
                  six in the evening, being four leagues to the westward of East Cape, we passed a
                  bay which was first discovered <pb n="324"/> by Lieutenant Hicks,* and which
                  therefore I called HICKS's BAY. At eight in the evening, being eight leagues to
                  the westward of the Cape, and three or four miles from the shore, I shortened sail
                  and brought to for the night, having at this time a fresh gale at S.S.E. and
                  squally; but it soon became moderate,* and at two in the morning, we made sail
                  again to the S. W. as the land now trended; and at eight o'clock in the morning,
                  saw land, which made like an island, bearing west, the south westermost part of
                  the main bearing south west; and about nine no less than five canoes came off, in
                  which were more than forty men, all armed with their country pikes and
                  battle-axes, shouting, and threatening an attack: this gave us great uneasiness,
                  and was indeed what we did not expect; for we hoped, that the report both of our
                  power and clemency had spread to a greater extent. When one of these canoes had
                  almost reached the ship, another, of an immense size, the largest we had yet seen,
                  crowded with people who were also armed, put off from the shore, and came up at a
                  great rate; as it approached it received signals from the canoe that was nearest
                  to the ship, and we could see that it had sixteen paddles on a side, beside people
                  that sat, and others that stood in a row from stem to stern, being in all about
                  sixty men: as they made directly to the ship, we were desirous of preventing an
                  attack, by showing what we could do; and therefore fired a gun, loaded with
                  grape-shot, ahead of them: this made them stop, but not retreat; a round shot was
                  then fired over them, and upon seeing it fall, they seized their paddles and made
                  towards the shore with such precipitation that they seemed scarcely to allow
                  themselves time to breathe. In the evening, three or four more canoes came off
                  unarmed; but they would not venture within a musquet shot of the vessel. The cape,
                  off which we had been threatened with hostilities, I <pb n="325"/> called, from
                  the hasty retreat of the enemy, CAPE RUNAWAY.* It lies in latitude <geo select="lat" n="41">37°
                     32′</geo>; longitude <geo select="lon" n="41">181° 48′</geo>. In this day's run, we found that the
                  land, which made like an island in the morning, bearing west, was so; and we gave
                  it the name of WHITE ISLAND. </p><p n="606">At day-break, on the first of November,* we counted no less than five and
                  forty canoes that were coming from the shore towards the ship: seven of them came
                  up with us, and after some conversation with Tupia, sold us some lobsters and
                  muscles, and two conger eels. These people traded pretty fairly: but when they
                  were gone, some others came off from another place, who began also to trade
                  fairly; but after some time they took what was handed down to them, without making
                  any return; one of them who had done so, upon being threatened, began to laugh,
                  and with many marks of derision set us at defiance, at the same time putting off
                  the canoe from the ship: a musquet was then fired over his head, which brought him
                  back in a more serious mood, and trade went on with great regularity. At length,
                  when the cabbin and gun-room had got as much as they wanted, the men were allowed
                  to come to the gang-way, and trade for themselves. Unhappily the same care was not
                  taken to prevent frauds as had been taken before, so that the Indians, finding
                  that they could cheat with impunity, grew insolent again, and proceeded to take
                  greater liberties. One of the canoes, having sold every thing on board, pulled
                  forward, and the people that were in her seeing some linen hang over the ship's
                  side to dry, one of them, without any ceremony, untied it, and put it up in his
                  bundle: he was immediately called to, and required to return it; instead of which,
                  he let his canoe drop a stern, and laughed at us: a musquet was fired over his
                  head, which did not put a stop to his mirth; another was then fired at him with
                  small shot, which struck <pb n="326"/> him upon the back;* he shrunk a little when
                  the shot hit him, but did not regard it more than one or our men would have done
                  the stroke of a rattan: he continued with great composure to pack up the linen
                  that he had stolen. All the canoes now dropped astern about a hundred yards, and
                  all set up their song of defiance, which they continued till the ship was distant
                  from them about four hundred yards. As they seemed to have no design to attack us,
                  I was not willing to do them any hurt; yet I thought their going off in a bravado
                  might have a bad effect when it should be reported ashore. To show them therefore
                  that they were still in our power, though very much beyond the reach of any
                  missile weapon with which they were acquainted, I gave the ship a yaw, and fired a
                  four pounder so as to pass near them. The shot happened to strike the water, and
                  rise several times at a great distance beyond the canoes: this struck them with
                  terror, and they paddled away without once looking behind them. </p><p n="607">About two in the afternoon, we saw a pretty high island bearing west from
                  us; and at five, saw more islands and rocks to the westward of that. We hauled our
                  wind in order to go without them, but could not weather them before it was dark. I
                  therefore bore up, and ran between them and the main. At seven, I was close under
                  the first, from which a large double canoe, or rather two canoes lashed together
                  at the distance of about a foot, and covered with boards so as make a deck, put
                  off, and made sail for the ship: this was the first vessel of the kind that we had
                  seen since we left the South Sea islands. When she came near, the people on board
                  entered very freely into conversation with Tupia, and we thought showed a friendly
                  disposition; but when it was just dark, they ran their canoe close to the ship's
                  side, and threw in a volley of stones, after which they paddled ashore. </p><p n="608"><pb n="327"/>We learnt from Tupia,* that the people in the canoe called the island
                  which we were under MOWTOHORA; it is but of a small circuit, though high, and lies
                  six miles from the main; on the south side is anchorage in fourteen fathom water.
                  Upon the main land S. W. by W. of this island, and apparently at no great distance
                  from the sea, is a high round mountain, which I called MOUNT EDGECOMBE: it stands
                  in the middle of a large plain, and is therefore the more conspicuous; latitude
                  <geo select="lat" n="42">37° 59′</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon" n="42">193° 7′</geo>. </p><p n="609">In standing westward, we suddenly shoaled our water from seventeen to ten
                  fathom; and knowing that we were not far from the small islands and rocks which we
                  had seen before dark, and which I intended to have passed before I brought to for
                  the night, I thought it more prudent to tack, and spend the night under Mowtohora,
                  where I knew there was no danger. It was indeed happy for us that we did so; for
                  in the morning, after we had made sail to the westward,* we discovered, ahead of
                  us, several rocks, some of which were level with the surface of the water, and
                  some below it: they lay N. N. E. from Mount Edgecombe, one league and a half
                  distant from the island Mowtohora, and about nine miles from the main. We passed
                  between these rocks and the main, having from ten to seven fathom water. </p><p n="610">This morning, many canoes and much people were seen along the shore;
                  several of the canoes followed us, but none of them could reach us, except one
                  with a sail, which proved to be the same that had pelted us the night before. The
                  people on board again entered into conversation with Tupia; but we expected
                  another volley of their ammunition, which was not indeed dangerous to any thing
                  but the cabbin windows. They continued abreast of the ship about an hour, and
                  behaved very peaceably; but at last the salute which we <pb n="328"/> expected was
                  given;* we returned it by firing a musquet over them, and they immediately dropped
                  a-stern and left us, perhaps rather satisfied with having given a test of their
                  courage by twice insulting a vessel so much superior to their own, than
                  intimidated by the shot. </p><p n="611">At half an hour after ten, we passed between a low flat island and the
                  main: the distance from one to the other was about four miles, and the depth of
                  water from ten to twelve fathom. The main land between this flat island and
                  Mowtohora is of a moderate height, but level, pretty clear of wood, and full of
                  plantations and villages. The villages, which were larger than any we had yet
                  seen, were built upon eminences near the sea, and fortified on the land side by a
                  bank and ditch, with a high paling within it, which was carried all round: beside
                  a bank, ditch, and pallisadoes, some of them appeared to have out-works. Tupia had
                  a notion that the small inclosures of pallisadoes, and a ditch that we had seen
                  before, were Morais or places of worship; but we were of opinion that they were
                  forts, and concluded that these people had neighbouring enemies, and were always
                  exposed to hostile attacks. </p><p n="612">At two o'clock we passed a small high island, lying four miles from a high
                  round head upon the main. From this head the land trends N. W. as far as can be
                  seen, and has a rugged and hilly appearance. As the weather was hazy, and the wind
                  blew fresh on the shore, we hauled off for the weathermost island in sight, which
                  bore from us N. N. E. distant about six or seven leagues. </p><p n="613">Under this island, which I have called the MAYOR, we spent the night.* At
                  seven in the morning it bore S. 47 E. distant six leagues, and a cluster of small
                  islands and rocks bore N. ½ E. distant one league, to which I gave the name of <pb n="329"/> the COURT OF ALDERMEN.* They lie in the compass of about half a
                  league every way, and five leagues from the main, between which and them lie other
                  islands, most of them barren rocks, of which there is great variety: some of them
                  are as small in compass as the Monument of London, but rise to a much greater
                  height, and some of them are inhabited. They lie in latitude <geo select="lat">36° 57′</geo>,
                  and at noon bore S. 60 E. distant three or four leagues; and a rock like a castle,
                  lying not far from the main, bore N. 40 W. at the distance of one league. The
                  country that we passed the night before, appeared to be well inhabited, many towns
                  were in sight, and some hundreds of large canoes lay under them upon the beach;
                  but this day, after having sailed about fifteen leagues, it appeared to be barren
                  and desolate. As far as we had yet coasted this country from Cape Turnagain, the
                  people acknowledged one Chief, whom they called TERATU, and to whose residence
                  they pointed, in a direction that we thought to be very far inland, but afterwards
                  found to be otherwise. </p><p n="614">About one o'clock three canoes came off to us from the main, with one and
                  twenty men on board. The construction of these vessels appeared to be more simple
                  than that of any we had seen, they being nothing more than trunks of a single tree
                  hollowed by fire, without any convenience or ornament. The people on board were
                  almost naked, and appeared to be of a browner complexion; yet naked and despicable
                  as they were, they sung their song of defiance, and seemed to denounce against us
                  inevitable destruction: they remained, however, some time out of stones throw, and
                  then venturing nearer, with less appearance of hostility, one of our men went to
                  the ship side, and was about to hand them a rope; this courtesy, however, they
                  thought fit to return by throwing a lance at him, which having missed him, <pb n="330"/> they immediately threw another into the ship:* upon this a musquet
                  was fired over them, which at once sent them away. </p><p n="615">About two, we saw a large opening, or inlet, for which we bore up; we had
                  new forty one fathom water, which gradually decreased to nine, at which time we
                  were one mile and an half distant from a high towered rock which lay near the
                  south point of the inlet: this rock, and the northermost of the Court of Aldermen
                  being in one, bearing S. 61 E. </p><p n="616">About seven in the evening we anchored in seven fathom, a little within
                  the south entrance of the bay: to this place we were accompanied by several canoes
                  and people like those we had seen last, and for some time they behaved very
                  civilly. While they were hovering about us, a bird was shot from the ship, as it
                  was swimming upon the water: at this they shewed less surprize than we expected,
                  and taking up the bird, they tied it to a fishing line that was towing astern; as
                  an acknowledgment for this favour we gave them a piece of cloth: but
                  notwithstanding this effect of our firearms, and this interchange of civilities,
                  as soon as it grew dark they sung their war song, and attempted to tow away the
                  buoy of the anchor. Two or three muskets were then fired over them, but this
                  seemed rather to make them angry than afraid, and they went away, threatening that
                  to-morrow they would return with more force, and be the death of us all; at the
                  same time sending off a boat, which they told us was going to another part of the
                  bay for assistance. </p><p n="617">There was some appearance of generosity, as well as courage, in
                  acquainting us with the time when they intended to make their attack, but they
                  forfeited all credit which this procured them, by coming secretly upon us in the
                  night, <pb n="331"/> when they certainly hoped to find us asleep:* upon
                  approaching the ship they found themselves mistaken, and therefore retired without
                  speaking a word, supposing that they were too early; after some time they came a
                  second time, and being again disappointed, they retired as silently as before. </p><p n="618">In the morning, at day-break,* they prepared to effect by force what they
                  had in vain attempted by stealth and artifice: no less than twelve canoes came
                  against us, with about a hundred and fifty men, all armed with pikes, lances, and
                  stones. As they could do nothing till they came very near the ship, Tupia was
                  ordered to expostulate with them, and if possible divert them from their purpose:
                  during the conversation they appeared to be sometimes friendly and sometimes
                  otherwise; at length, however, they began to trade, and we offered to purchase
                  their weapons, which some of them consented to sell: they sold two very fairly,
                  but having received what had been agreed upon for the purchase of a third, they
                  refused to send it up, but offered it for a second price; a second was sent down,
                  but the weapon was still detained, and a demand made of a third; this being
                  refused with some expressions of displeasure and resentment, the offender, with
                  many ludicrous tokens of contempt and defiance, paddled his canoe off a few yards
                  from the ship. As I intended to continue in this place five or six days, in order
                  to make an observation of the transit of Mercury, it was absolutely necessary, in
                  order to prevent future mischief, to shew these people that we were not to be
                  treated ill with impunity; some small shot were therefore fired at the thief, and
                  a musket ball through the bottom of his boat: upon this it was paddled to about a
                  hundred yards distance, and to our great surprize the people in the other canoes
                  took not the least notice of their wounded companion, though he bled very much,
                  but returned to the ship, and continued to trade with the <pb n="332"/> most
                  perfect indifference and unconcern.* They fold us many more of their weapons
                  without making any other attempt to defraud us, for a considerable time; at last,
                  however, one of them thought fit to paddle away with two different pieces of cloth
                  which had been given for the same weapon: when he had got about an hundred yards
                  distance, and thought himself secure of his prize, a musket was fired after him,
                  which fortunately struck the boat just at the water's edge, and made two holes in
                  her side; this only incited them to ply their paddles with greater activity, and
                  the rest of the canoes also made off with the utmost expedition. As the last proof
                  of our superiority therefore, we fired a round shot over them, and not a boat
                  stopped till they got on shore. </p><p n="619">About ten o'clock, I went with two boats to sound the bay, and look out
                  for a more convenient anchoring-place, the Master being in one boat and myself in
                  the other. We pulled first over to the north shore, from which some canoes came
                  out to meet us; as we advanced, however, they retired, inviting us to follow them:
                  but, seeing them all armed, I did not think it proper to comply, but went towards
                  the head of the bay, where I observed a village upon a very high point, fortified
                  in the manner that has been already described, and having fixed upon an
                  anchoring-place not far from where the ship lay, I returned on board. </p><p n="620">At three o'clock in the afternoon, I weighed, run in nearer to the shore,
                  and anchored in four fathom and an half water, with a soft sandy bottom, the south
                  point of the bay bearing E. distant one mile, and a river which the boats can
                  enter at low water S. S. E. distant a mile and an half. </p><p n="621">*In the morning, the natives came off again to the ship, and we had the
                  satisfaction to observe that their behaviour was very different from what it had
                  been yesterday: among <pb n="333"/> them was an old man,* whom we had before
                  remarked for his prudence and honesty: his name was TOIAVA, and he seemed to be a
                  person of a superior rank; in the transactions of yesterday morning he had behaved
                  with great propriety and good sense, lying in a small canoe, always near the ship,
                  and treating those on board as if he neither intended a fraud nor suspected an
                  injury: with some persuasion this man and another came on board, and ventured into
                  the cabin, where I presented each of them with a piece of English cloth and some
                  spike nails. They told us that the Indians were now very much afraid of us, and on
                  our part we promised friendship if they would behave peaceably, desiring only to
                  purchase what they had to sell upon their own terms. </p><p n="622">After the natives had left us, I went with the pinnace and long-boat into
                  the river with a design to haul the seine, and sent the Master in the yawl to
                  sound the bay and dredge for fish. The Indians who were on one side of the river,
                  expressed their friendship by all the signs they could devise, beckoning us to
                  land among them; but we chose to go ashore on the other side, as the situation was
                  more convenient for hauling the seine and shooting birds, of which we saw great
                  numbers of various kinds: the Indians with much persuasion, about noon, ventured
                  over to us. With the seine we had very little success, catching only a few
                  mullets, neither did we get any thing by the trawl or the dredge, except a few
                  shells; but we shot several birds, most of them resembling sea-pies, except that
                  they had black plumage, and red bills and feet. While we were absent with our
                  guns, the people who staid by the boats saw two of the Indians quarrel and fight:
                  they began the battle with their lances, but some old men interposed and took them
                  away, leaving them to decide the difference, like Englishmen, with their fists:
                  they boxed with great vigour and obstinacy for some time, but by <pb n="334"/>
                  degrees all retired behind a little hill,* so that our people could not see the
                  event of the combat. </p><p n="623">*In the morning the long-boat was sent again to traul in the bay, and an
                  officer, with the marines, and a party of men, to cut wood and haul the seine. The
                  Indians on shore appeared very peaceable and submissive, and we had reason to
                  believe that their habitations were at a considerable distance, for we saw no
                  houses, and found that they slept under the bushes: the bay is probably a place to
                  which they frequently resort in parties to gather shell-fish, of which it affords
                  incredible plenty, for wherever we went, whether upon the hills or in the vallies,
                  the woods or the plains, we saw vast heaps of shells, often many waggon loads
                  together, some appearing to be very old, and others recent. We saw no cultivation
                  in this place, which had a desolate and barren appearance; the tops of the hills
                  were green, but nothing grew there except a large kind of fern, the roots of which
                  the natives had got together in large quantities, in order to carry away with
                  them. In the evening Mr. Banks walked up the river, which at the mouth looked fine
                  and broad, but at the distance of about two miles was not deep enough to cover the
                  foot; and the country inland was still more barren than at the sea-side. The seine
                  and dredge were not more successful to-day than yesterday, but the Indians in some
                  measure compensated for the disappointment by bringing us several baskets of fish,
                  some dry, and some fresh dressed; it was not indeed of the best, but I ordered it
                  all to be bought for the encouragement of trade. </p><p n="624">*On the <date>7th</date>, the weather was so bad that none of us left the ship, nor did
                  any of the Indians come on board. </p><p n="625">*On the <date>8th</date>, I sent a party of men on shore to wood and water; and in the
                  mean time many canoes came off, in one <pb n="335"/> of which was our friend
                  Toiava;* soon after he was alongside of the ship, he saw two canoes coming from
                  the opposite side of the bay, upon which he hasted back again to the shore with
                  all his canoes, telling us that he was afraid of the people who were coming: this
                  was a farther proof that the people of this country were perpetually committing
                  hostilities against each other. In a short time, however, he returned, having
                  discovered that the people who had alarmed him were not the same that he had
                  supposed. The natives that came to the ship this morning sold us, for a few pieces
                  of cloth, as much fish of the mackrel kind as served the whole ship's company, and
                  they were as good as ever were eaten. At noon, this day, I observed the sun's
                  meridional zenith distance by an astronomical quadrant, which gave the latitude
                  <geo select="lat">36° 47′ 43″</geo> within the south entrance of the bay. </p><p n="626">Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander went on shore and collected a great variety of
                  plants, altogether unknown, and not returning till the evening, had an opportunity
                  of observing in what manner the Indians disposed themselves to pass the night.
                  They had no shelter but a few shrubs: the women and the children were ranged
                  innermost, or farthest from the sea; the men lay in a kind of half circle round
                  them, and their arms were set up against the trees close by them, in a manner
                  which showed that they were afraid of an attack by some enemy not far distant. It
                  was also discovered that they acknowledged neither Teratu, nor any other person as
                  their king: as in this particular they differed from all the people that we had
                  seen upon other parts of the coast, we thought it possible that they might be a
                  set of outlaws, in a state of rebellion against Teratu, and in that case they
                  might have no settled habitations, or cultivated land in any part of the country. </p><p n="627"><pb n="336"/>*On the <date>9th</date>, at day-break, a great number of canoes came on board,
                  loaded with mackrel of two sorts, one exactly the same with those caught in
                  England, and the other somewhat different: we imagined the people had taken a
                  large shoal, and brought us an overplus which they could not consume; for they
                  sold them at a very low rate. They were, however, very welcome to us; at eight
                  o'clock, the ship had more fish on board than all her people could eat in three
                  days; and before night, the quantity was so much increased, that every man who
                  could get salt, cured as many as would last him a month. </p><p n="628">After an early breakfast, I went ashore, with Mr. Green and proper
                  instruments, to observe the transit of Mercury, Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander being
                  of the party; the weather had for some time been very thick, with much rain, but
                  this day was so favourable that not a cloud intervened during the whole transit.
                  The observation of the ingress was made by Mr. Green alone, while I was employed
                  in taking the sun's altitude to ascertain the time. It came on at <date>7h</date> 20′ 58″
                  apparent time: according to Mr. Green's observation, the internal contact was at
                  <date>12h</date> 8′ 58″, the external at <date>12h</date> 9′ 55″ P.M. And according to mine, the internal
                  contact was at <date>12h</date> 8′ 54″, and the external <date>12h</date> 9′ 48″; the latitude of the place
                  of observation was <geo select="lat">30° 48′ 5½″</geo>. The latitude observed at noon was
                  <geo select="lat">36° 48′ 28″</geo>. The mean of this and yesterday's observation gives
                  <geo select="lat">36° 48′ 5½″ S</geo>. the latitude of the place of observation; the
                  variation of the compass was <geo select="lat">11° 9′ E</geo>. </p><p n="629">About noon, we were alarmed by the firing of a great gun from the ship;
                  Mr. Gore, my Second Lieutenant, was at this time commanding officer on board, and
                  the account that he gave was this. While some small canoes were trading with the
                  people, two very large ones came up, full of men, one <pb n="337"/> of them having
                  on board forty-seven, all armed with pikes,* darts, and stones, and apparently
                  with a hostile intention: they appeared to be strangers, and to be rather
                  conscious of superiority over us by their numbers, than afraid of any weapons
                  which could give us the superiority over them: no attack however was made;
                  probably because they learnt from the people in the other canoes, with whom they
                  immediately entered into conference, what kind of an enemy they had to deal with:
                  after a little time, they began to trade, some of them offering their arms, and
                  one of them a square piece of cloth, which makes a part of their dress, called a
                  Haahow; several of the weapons were purchased, and Mr. Gore having agreed for a
                  Haahow, sent down the price, which was a piece of British cloth, and expected his
                  purchase: but the Indian, as soon as he had got Mr. Gore's cloth in his
                  possession, refused to part with his own, and put off the canoe: upon being
                  threatened for this fraud, he and his companions began to sing their war song in
                  defiance, and shook their paddles: still however they began no attack, only
                  defying Mr. Gore to take any remedy in his power, which so provoked him that he
                  levelled a musquet loaded with ball at the offender, while he was holding the
                  cloth in his hand, and shot him dead. It would have been happy, if the effect of a
                  few small shot had been tried upon this occasion, which upon some others had been
                  successful. </p><p n="630">When the Indian dropped, all the canoes put off to some distance; but as
                  they did not go away, it was thought they might still meditate an attack. To
                  secure therefore a safe passage for the boat, which it was necessary to send on
                  shore, a round shot was fired over their heads, which effectually answered the
                  purpose, and put them all to flight. When an account of what had happened was
                  brought ashore, our Indians <pb n="338"/> were alarmed,* and drawing all together,
                  retreated in a body. After a short time, however, they returned, having heard a
                  more particular account of the affair; and intimated that they thought the man who
                  had been killed deserved his fate. </p><p n="631">A little before sunset the Indians retired to eat their supper, and we
                  went with them to be spectators of the repast; it consisted of fish of different
                  kinds, among which were lobsters, and some birds, of a species unknown to us:
                  these were either roasted or baked; to roast them, they fastened them upon a small
                  stick, which was stuck up in the ground, inclining towards their fire; and to bake
                  them, they put them into a hole in the ground with hot stones, in the same manner
                  as the people of Otaheite. </p><p n="632">Among the natives that were assembled upon this occasion, we saw a woman,
                  who, after their manner, was mourning for the death of her relation: she sat upon
                  the ground near the rest, who, one only excepted, seemed not at all to regard her:
                  the tears constantly trickled down her cheeks, and she repeated in a low, but very
                  mournful voice, words, which even Tupia did not at all understand: at the end of
                  every sentence she cut her arms, her face, or her breast with a shell that she
                  held in her hand, so that she was almost covered with blood, and was indeed one of
                  the most affecting spectacles that can be conceived. The cuts, however, did not
                  appear to be so deep as are sometimes made upon similar occasions, if we may judge
                  by the scars which we saw upon the arms, thighs, breasts, and cheeks of many of
                  them, which we were told were the remains of wounds which they had inflicted upon
                  themselves as testimonies of their affection and sorrow. </p><p n="633">*The next day, I went with two boats, accompanied by Mr. Banks and the
                  other Gentlemen, to examine a large river <pb n="339"/> that empties itself into
                  the head of the bay.* We rowed about four or five miles up, and could have gone
                  much farther if the weather had been favourable. It was here wider than at the
                  mouth, and divided into many streams by small flat islands, which are covered with
                  mangroves, and overflowed at high water. From these trees exudes a viscous
                  substance which very much resembles resin: we found it first in small lumps upon
                  the sea beach, and now saw it sticking to the trees, by which we knew whence it
                  came. We landed on the east side of the river, where we saw a tree upon which
                  several shags had built their nests, and here therefore we determined to dine;
                  twenty of the shags were soon killed, and being broiled upon the spot, afforded us
                  an excellent meal. We then went upon the hills from whence I thought I saw the
                  head of the river. The shore on each side, as well as the islands in the middle,
                  were covered with mangroves; and the sand-banks abounded in cockles and clams: in
                  many places there were rock oysters, and every where plenty of wild fowl,
                  principally shags, ducks, curlieus, and the sea-pie, that has been described
                  before. We also saw fish in the river, but of what kind we could not discover: the
                  country on the east side of this river is for the most part barren, and destitute
                  of wood; but on the west it has a better aspect, and in some places is adorned
                  with trees, but has in no part the appearance of cultivation. In the entrance of
                  the river, and for two or three miles up, there is good anchoring in four and five
                  fathom water, and places very convenient for laying a vessel on shore, where the
                  tide rises and falls seven feet at the full and change of the moon. We could not
                  determine, whether any considerable stream of fresh water came into this river out
                  of the country; but we saw a number of small rivulets issue from the adjacent
                  hills. Near the mouth of this river, on the east side, we found a little Indian
                  village, <pb n="340"/> consisting of small temporary sheds,* where we landed, and
                  were received by the people with the utmost kindness and hospitality: they treated
                  us with a flat shell-fish of a most delicious taste, somewhat like a cockle, which
                  we eat hot from the coals. Near this place is a high point or peninsula,
                  projecting into the river, and upon it are the remains of a fort, which they call
                  Eppah or Heppah. The best engineer in Europe could not have chosen a situation
                  better adapted to enable a small number to defend themselves against a greater.
                  The steepness of the cliffs renders it wholly inaccessible from the water which
                  incloses it on three sides; and, to the land, it is fortified by a ditch, and a
                  bank raised on the inside: from the top of the bank to the bottom of the ditch, is
                  two and twenty feet; the ditch on the outside is fourteen feet deep, and its
                  breadth is in proportion. The whole seemed to have been executed with great
                  judgment; and there had been a row of pickets or pallisadoes, both on the top of
                  the bank and along the brink of the ditch on the outside; those on the outside had
                  been driven very deep into the ground, and were inclined towards the ditch, so as
                  to project over it; but of these the thickest posts only were left, and upon them
                  there were evident marks of fire, so that the place had probably been taken and
                  destroyed by an enemy. If any occasion should make it necessary for a ship to
                  winter here, or stay any time, tents might be built in this place, which is
                  sufficiently spacious, with great convenience, and might easily be made
                  impregnable to the whole country. </p><p n="634">*On the eleventh, there was so much wind and rain that no canoe came off;
                  but the long-boat was sent to fetch oysters from one of the beds which had been
                  discovered the day before: the boat soon returned, deeply laden, and the oysters,
                  which were as good as ever came from Colchester, and about the same size, were
                  laid down under the booms, and the <!--Page  [unnumbered]--></p><p n="635">[illustration] <pb n="341"/> ship's company did nothing but eat them from
                  the time they came on board till night, when,* as may reasonably be supposed,
                  great part of them were expended; this, however, gave us no concern, as we knew
                  that not the boat only, but the ship, might have been loaded, almost in one tide,
                  as the beds are dry at half ebb. In the morning of Sunday the <date>12th</date>,* two canoes
                  came off full of people whom we had never seen before, but who appeared to have
                  heard of us by the caution which they used in approaching us. As we invited them
                  to come alongside with all the tokens of friendship that we could shew, they
                  ventured up, and two of them came on board; the rest traded very fairly for what
                  they had: a small canoe also came from the other side of the bay, and sold us some
                  very large fish, which they gave us to understand they would have brought
                  yesterday, having caught them the day before, but that the wind was so high they
                  could not venture to sea. </p><p n="636">After breakfast, I went with the pinnace and yawl, accompanied by Mr.
                  Banks and Dr. Solander, over to the north side of the bay, to take a view of the
                  country, and two fortified villages which we had discovered at a distance. We
                  landed near the smallest of them, the situation of which was the most beautifully
                  romantic that can be imagined; it was built upon a small rock, detached from the
                  main, and surrounded at high water. The whole body of this rock was perforated by
                  an hollow or arch, which possessed much the largest part of it; the top of the
                  arch was above sixty feet perpendicular above the sea, which at high water flowed
                  through the bottom of it: the whole summit of the rock above the arch was fenced
                  round after their manner; but the area was not large enough to contain more than
                  five or six houses: it was accessible <pb n="342"/> only by one very narrow and
                  steep path,* by which the inhabitants, at our approach, came down, and invited us
                  into the place; but we refused, intending to visit a much more considerable fort
                  of the same kind at about a mile's distance. We made some presents however to the
                  women, and in the mean time we saw the inhabitants of the town which we were going
                  to, coming towards us in a body, men, women, and children, to the number of about
                  one hundred: when they came near enough to be heard, they waved their hands and
                  called out Horomai; after which they sat down among the bushes near the beach:
                  these ceremonies we were told were certain signs of their friendly disposition. We
                  advanced to the place where they were sitting, and when we came up, made them a
                  few presents, and asked leave to visit their Heppah; they consented with joy in
                  their countenances, and immediately led the way. It is called WHARRETOUWA, and is
                  situated upon a high promontory or point, which projects into the sea, on the
                  north side, and near the head of the bay: two sides of it are washed by the sea,
                  and these are altogether inaccessible; two other sides are to the land: up one of
                  them, which is very steep, lies the avenue from the beach; the other is flat and
                  open to the country upon the hill, which is a narrow ridge: the whole is inclosed
                  by a pallisade about ten feet high, consisting of strong pales bound together with
                  withes. The weak side next the land is also defended by a double ditch, the
                  innermost of which has a bank and an additional pallisade; the inner pallisades
                  are upon the bank next the town, but at such a distance from the top of the bank
                  as to leave room for men to walk and use their arms, between them and the inner
                  ditch: the outermost pallisades are between the two ditches, and driven obliquely
                  into the ground, so that their upper ends incline over the inner ditch: the depth
                  of this ditch, from the bottom to <pb n="343"/> the top or crown of the bank, is
                  four and twenty feet.* Close within the innermost pallisade is a stage, twenty
                  feet high, forty feet long, and six broad; it is supported by strong posts, and is
                  intended as a station for those who defend the place, from which they may annoy
                  the assailants by darts and stones, heaps of which lay ready for use. Another
                  stage of the same kind commands the steep avenue from the beach, and stands also
                  within the pallisade; on this side of the hill there are some little outworks and
                  huts, not intended as advanced posts, but as the habitations of people who for
                  want of room could not be accommodated within the works, but who were,
                  notwithstanding, desirous of placing themselves under their protection. The
                  pallisades, as has been observed already, run round the whole brow of the hill, as
                  well towards the sea as towards the land; but the ground within having originally
                  been a mount, they have reduced it not to one level, but to several, rising in
                  stages one above the other, like an amphitheatre, each of which is inclosed within
                  its separate pallisade; they communicate with each other by narrow lanes, which
                  might easily be stopped up, so that if an enemy should force the outward
                  pallisade, he would have others to carry before the place could be wholly reduced,
                  supposing these places to be obstinately defended one after the other. The only
                  entrance is by a narrow passage, about twelve feet long, communicating with the
                  steep ascent from the beach: it passes under one of the fighting stages, and
                  though we saw nothing like a door or gateway, it may be easily barricaded in a
                  manner that will make the forcing it a very dangerous and difficult undertaking.
                  Upon the whole, this must be considered as a place of great strength, in which a
                  small number of resolute men may defend themselves against all the force which a
                  people with no other arms than those that are in use here <pb n="344"/> could
                  bring against it.* It seemed to be well furnished for a siege with every thing but
                  water; we saw great quantities of fern root, which they eat as bread, and dried
                  fish piled up in heaps; but we could not perceive that they had any fresh water
                  nearer than a brook, which runs close under the foot of the hill: whether they
                  have any means of getting it from this place during a siege, or whether they have
                  any method of storing it within the works in gourds or other vessels, we could not
                  learn; some resource they certainly have with respect to this article, an
                  indispensable necessary of life, for otherwise the laying up dry provisions could
                  answer no purpose. Upon our expressing a desire to see their method of attack and
                  defence, one of the young men mounted a fighting stage, which they call Porava,
                  and another went into the ditch: both he that was to defend the place, and he that
                  was to assault it, sung the war-song, and danced with the same frightful
                  gesticulations that we had seen used in more serious circumstances, to work
                  themselves up into a degree of that mechanical fury, which, among all uncivilized
                  nations, is the necessary prelude to a battle; for dispassionate courage, a
                  strength of mind that can surmount the sense of danger, without a flow of animal
                  spirits by which it is extinguished, seems to be the prerogative of those who have
                  projects of more lasting importance, and a keener sense of honour and disgrace,
                  than can be formed or felt by men who have few pains or pleasures besides those of
                  mere animal life, and scarcely any purpose but to provide for the day that is
                  passing over them, to obtain plunder, or revenge an insult: they will march
                  against each other indeed in cool blood, though they find it necessary to work
                  themselves into passion before they engage; as among us there have been many
                  instances of people who have deliberately made themselves drunk, that they might
                  execute a project which they formed when <pb n="345"/> they were sober, but which,
                  while they continued so,* they did not dare to undertake. </p><p n="637">On the side of the hill, near this inclosure, we saw about half an acre
                  planted with gourds and sweet potatoes, which was the only cultivation in the bay:
                  under the foot of the point upon which this fortification stands, are two rocks,
                  one just broken off from the main, and the other not perfectly detached from it:
                  they are both small, and seem more proper for the habitations of birds than men;
                  yet there are houses and places of defence upon each of them. And we saw many
                  other works of the same kind upon small islands, rocks, and ridges of hills, on
                  different parts of the coast, besides many fortified towns, which appeared to be
                  much superior to this. </p><p n="638">The perpetual hostility in which these poor savages, who have made every
                  village a fort, must necessarily live, will account for there being so little of
                  their land in a state of cultivation; and, as mischiefs very often reciprocally
                  produce each other, it may perhaps appear, that there being so little land in a
                  state of cultivation, will account for their living in perpetual hostility. But it
                  is very strange, that the same invention and diligence which have been used in the
                  construction of places so admirably adapted to defence, almost without tools,
                  should not, when urged by the same necessity, have furnished them with a single
                  missile weapon except the lance, which is thrown by hand: they have no contrivance
                  like a bow to discharge a dart, nor any thing like a sling to assist them in
                  throwing a stone; which is the more surprising, as the invention of slings, and
                  bows and arrows, is much more obvious than of the works which these people
                  construct, and both these weapons are found among much ruder nations, and in
                  almost every other part of the world. Besides <pb n="346"/> the long lance and
                  Patoo-Patoo,* which have been mentioned already, they have a staff about five feet
                  long, sometimes pointed, like a Serjeant's halberd, sometimes only tapering to a
                  point at one end, and having the other end broad, and shaped somewhat like the
                  blade of an oar. They have also another weapon, about a foot shorter than these,
                  pointed at one end, and at the other shaped like an axe. The points of their long
                  lances are barbed, and they handle them with such strength and agility, that we
                  can match them with no weapon but a loaded musquet. </p><p n="639">After taking a slight view of the country, and loading both the boats with
                  celery, which we found in great plenty near the beach, we returned from our
                  excursion, and about five o'clock in the evening got on board the ship. </p><p n="640">*On the <date>15th</date>, I sailed out of the bay, and at the same time had several
                  canoes on board, in one of which was our friend Toiava, who said, that as soon as
                  we were gone he must repair to his Heppah or fort, because the friends of the man
                  who had been shot by Mr. Gore on the <date>9th</date>, had threatened to revenge his death upon
                  him, whom they had reproached as being our friend. Off the north point of the bay,
                  I saw a great number of islands, of various extent, which lay scattered to the
                  north west, in a direction parallel with the main as far as I could see. I steered
                  north east for the north eastermost of these islands; but the wind coming to the
                  north west, I was obliged to stand out to sea. </p><p n="641">To the bay which we had now left I gave the name of MERCURY BAY, on
                  account of the observation which we had made there of the transit of that planet
                  over the sun. It lies in latitude <geo select="lat" n="44">36° 47′ S</geo>.; and in the longitude of
                  <geo select="lon" n="44">184° 4′ W</geo>.: there are several islands lying both to the southward
                  and northward of it, and a small island or rock in the middle of <pb n="347"/> the
                  entrance:* within this island the depth of water no where exceeds nine fathom: the
                  best anchoring is in a sandy bay, which lies just within the south head, in five
                  and four fathom, bringing a high tower or rock, which lies without the head, in
                  one with the head, or just shut in behind it. This place is very convenient both
                  for wooding and watering, and in the river there is an immense quantity of oysters
                  and other shell-fish: I have for this reason given it the name of OYSTER RIVER.
                  But for a ship that wants to stay here any time, the best and safest place is in
                  the river at the head of the bay; which, from the number of mangrove trees about
                  it, I have called MANGROVE RIVER. To sail into this river, the south shore must be
                  kept all the way on board. The country on the east side of the river and bay is
                  very barren, its only produce being fern, and a few other plants that will grow in
                  a poor soil. The land on the north west side is covered with wood, and the soil
                  being much more fertile, would doubtless produce all the necessaries of life with
                  proper cultivation: it is not however so fertile as the lands that we have seen to
                  the southward; nor do the inhabitants, though numerous, make so good an
                  appearance: they have no plantations; their canoes are mean, and without ornament;
                  they sleep in the open air; and say, that Teratu, whose sovereignty they do not
                  acknowledge, if he was to come among them, would kill them. This favoured our
                  opinion of their being outlaws; yet they told us, that they had Heppahs or strong
                  holds, to which they retired in time of imminent danger. </p><p n="642">We found, thrown upon the shore, in several parts of this bay, great
                  quantities of iron-sand, which is brought down by every little rivulet of fresh
                  water that finds its way from the country; which is a demonstration that there is
                  ore of <pb n="348"/> that metal not far inland:* yet neither the inhabitants of
                  this place, or any other part of the coast that we have seen, know the use of
                  iron, or set the least value upon it; all of them preferring the most worthless
                  and useless trifle, not only to a nail, but to any tool of that metal. </p><p n="643">Before we left the bay, we cut upon one of the trees near the
                  watering-place the ship's name, and that of the Commander, with the date of the
                  year and month when we were there; and, after displaying the English colours, I
                  took a formal possession of it in the name of his Britannic Majesty King George
                  the Third. </p></div><pb n="349"/><div type="chapter" n="24"><head><l>CHAP.IV.</l><l><emph rend="italic"> The Range from Mercury Bay to the Bay of Islands: An

                  <date>18th</date>, about seven in the morning,* we were abreast of a very conspicuous
                  promontory, being then in latitude <geo select="lat">36° 26′</geo>, and in the direction of N.
                  48 W. from the north head of Mercury Bay or Point Mercury, which was distant nine
                  leagues: upon this point stood many people, who seemed to take little notice of
                  us, but talked together with great earnestness. In about half an hour, several
                  canoes put off from different places, and came towards the ship; upon which the
                  people on the point also launched a canoe, and about twenty of them came in her up
                  with the others. When two of these canoes, in which there might be about sixty
                  men, came near enough to make themselves heard, they sung their war-song; but
                  seeing that we took little notice of it, they threw a few stones at us, and then
                  rowed off towards the shore. We hoped that we had now done with them, but in a
                  short time they returned, as if with a fixed resolution to provoke us into a
                  battle, animating themselves by their song as they had done before. Tupia, without
                  any <pb n="350"/> directions from us,* went to the poop, and began to expostulate:
                  he told them, that we had weapons which would destroy them in a moment; and that,
                  if they ventured to attack us, we should be obliged to use them. Upon this, they
                  flourished their weapons, and cried out, in their language, "Come on shore, and we
                  will kill you all:" Well, said Tupia, but why should you molest us while we are at
                  sea? as we do not wish to fight, we shall not accept your challenge to come on
                  shore; and here there is no pretence for a quarrel, the sea being no more your
                  property than the ship. This eloquence of Tupia, though it greatly surprised us,
                  having given him no hints for the arguments he used, had no effect upon our
                  enemies, who very soon renewed their battery: a musquet was then fired through one
                  of their boats, and this was an argument of sufficient weight, for they
                  immediately fell astern and left us. </p><p n="645">From the point, of which we were now abreast, the land trends W. ½ S. near
                  a league, and then S. S. E. as far as we could see; and, besides the islands that
                  lay without us, we could see land round by the S. W. as far as the N. W.; but
                  whether this was the main or islands, we could not then determine: the fear of
                  losing the main, however, made me resolve to follow its direction. With this view,
                  I hauled round the point and steered to the southward, but there being light airs
                  all round the compass, we made but little progress. </p><p n="646">About one o'clock, a breeze sprung up at east, which afterwards came to N.
                  E. and we steered along the shore S. by E. and S. S. E. having from twenty-five to
                  eighteen fathom. </p><p n="647">At about half an hour after seven in the evening, having run seven or
                  eight leagues since noon, I anchored in twenty-three fathom, not chusing to run
                  any farther in the dark, as I had now land on both sides, forming the entrance of
                  a <pb n="351"/> streight, bay, or river,* lying S. by E. for on that point we
                  could see no land. </p><p n="648">At day-break, on the <date>19th</date>, the wind being still favourable,* we weighed
                  and stood with an easy sail up the inlet, keeping nearest to the east side. In a
                  short time, two large canoes came off to us from the shore; the people on board
                  said, that they knew Toiava very well, and called Tupia by his name. I invited
                  some of them on board; and as they knew they had nothing to fear from us, while
                  they behaved honestly and peaceably, they immediately complied: I made each of
                  them some presents, and dismissed them much gratified. Other canoes afterwards
                  came up to us from a different side of the bay; and the people on board of these
                  also mentioned the name of Toiava, and sent a young man into the ship, who told us
                  he was his grandson, and he also was dismissed with a present. </p><p n="649">After having run about five leagues from the place where we had anchored
                  the night before, our depth of water gradually decreased to six fathom; and not
                  chusing to go into less, as it was tide of flood, and the wind blew right up the
                  inlet, I came to an anchor about the middle of the channel, which is near eleven
                  miles over; after which I sent two boats out to sound, one on one side, and the
                  other on the other. </p><p n="650">The boats not having found above three feet more water than we were now
                  in, I determined to go no farther with the ship, but to examine the head of the
                  bay in the boats; for, as it appeared to run a good way inland, I thought this a
                  favourable opportunity to examine the interior part of the country, and its
                  produce. </p><p n="651">At day-break, therefore,* I set out in the pinnace and longboat,
                  accompanied by Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and Tupia; <pb n="352"/> and we found the
                  inlet end in a river,* about nine miles above the ship: into this river we entered
                  with the first of the flood, and within three miles found the water perfectly
                  fresh. Before we had proceeded more than one third of that distance, we found an
                  Indian town, which was built upon a a small bank of dry sand, but intirely
                  surrounded by a deep mud, which possibly the inhabitants might consider as a
                  defence. These people, as soon as they saw us, thronged to the banks, and invited
                  us on shore. We accepted the invitation, and made them a visit notwithstanding the
                  mud. They received us with open arms, having heard of us from our good old friend
                  Toiava; but our stay could not be long, as we had other objects of curiosity in
                  view. We proceeded up the river till near noon, when we were fourteen miles within
                  its entrance; and then, finding the face of the country to continue nearly the
                  same, without any alteration in the course of the stream, which we had no hope of
                  tracing to its source, we landed on the west side, to take a view of the lofty
                  trees which every where adorned its banks. They were of a kind that we had seen
                  before, though only at a distance, both in Poverty Bay and Hawke's Bay. Before we
                  had walked an hundred yards into the wood, we met with one of them which was
                  nineteen feet eight inches in the girt, at the height of six feet above the
                  ground: having a quadrant with me, I measured its height from the root to the
                  first branch, and found it to be eighty-nine feet: it was as strait as an arrow,
                  and tapered but very little in proportion to its height; so that I judged there
                  were three hundred and fifty-six feet of solid timber in it, exclusive of the
                  branches. As we advanced, we saw many others that were still larger; we cut down a
                  young one, and the wood proved heavy and solid, not fit for masts, but such as
                  would make the finest plank in the world. Our carpenter, who was with us, said
                  that the <pb n="353"/> timber resembled that of the pitch-pine,* which is
                  lightened by tapping; and possibly some such method might be found to lighten
                  these, and they would then be such masts as no country in Europe can produce. As
                  the wood was swampy, we could not range far; but we found many stout trees of
                  other kinds, all of them utterly unknown to us, specimens of which we brought
                  away. </p><p n="652">The river at this height is as broad as the Thames at Greenwich, and the
                  tide of flood as strong; it is not indeed quite so deep, but has water enough for
                  vessels of more than a middle size, and a bottom of mud, so soft that nothing
                  could take damage by running ashore. </p><p n="653">About three o'clock, we reimbarked, in order to return with the first of
                  the ebb, and named the river the THAMES, it having some resemblance to our own
                  river of that name. In our return, the inhabitants of the village where we had
                  been ashore, seeing us take another channel, came off to us in their canoes, and
                  trafficked with us in the most friendly manner, till they had disposed of the few
                  trifles they had. The tide of ebb just carried us out of the narrow part of the
                  river, into the channel that run up from the sea, before it was dark; and we
                  pulled hard to reach the ship, but meeting the flood, and a strong breeze at N. N.
                  W. with showers of rain, we were obliged to desist; and about midnight, we run
                  under the land, and came to a grappling, where we took such rest as our situation
                  would admit.* At break of day, we set forward again, and it was past seven o'clock
                  before we reached the ship. We were all extremely tired, but thought ourselves
                  happy to be on board; for before nine it blew so hard that the boat could not have
                  rowed ahead, and must therefore either have gone ashore, or taken shelter under
                  it. </p><p n="654"><pb n="354"/>*About three o'clock, having the tide of ebb, we took up our anchor,
                  made sail, and plied down the river till eight in the evening, when we came to an
                  anchor again: early in the morning we made sail with the first ebb,* and kept
                  plying till the flood obliged us once more to come to an anchor. As we had now
                  only a light breeze, I went in the pinnace, accompanied by Dr. Solander, to the
                  western shore; but I saw nothing worthy of notice. </p><p n="655">When I left the ship, many canoes were about it; Mr. Banks therefore chose
                  to stay on board, and traffic with the natives: they bartered their clothes and
                  arms, chiefly for paper, and behaved with great friendship and honesty. But while
                  some of them were below with Mr. Banks, a young man who was upon the deck stole a
                  half minute glass which was in the binacle, and was detected just as he was
                  carrying it off. Mr. Hicks, who was commanding officer on board, took it into his
                  head to punish him, by giving him twelve lashes with a cat-o'nine-tails; and
                  accordingly ordered him to be taken to the gang-way, and tied up to the shrouds.
                  When the other Indians who were on board saw him seized, they attempted to rescue
                  him; and being resisted, called for their arms, which were handed up from the
                  canoes, and the people of one of them attempted to come up the ship's side. The
                  tumult was heard by Mr. Banks, who, with Tupia, came hastily upon the deck to see
                  what had happened. The Indians immediately ran to Tupia, who, finding Mr. Hicks
                  inexorable, could only assure them, that nothing was intended against the life of
                  their companion; but that it was necessary he should suffer some punishment for
                  his offence, which being explained to them, they seemed to be satisfied. The
                  punishment was then inflicted, and as soon as the criminal was unbound, an old man
                  among the spectators, who was <pb n="355"/> supposed to be his father, gave him a
                  hearty beating,* and sent him down into his canoe. All the canoes then dropped
                  a-stern, and the people said that they were afraid to come any more near the ship:
                  after much persuasion, however, they ventured back again, but their cheerful
                  confidence was at an end, and their stay was short; they promised indeed, at their
                  departure, to return with some fish, but we saw no more of them. </p><p n="656">On the <date>23d</date>, the wind being contrary,* we kept plying down the river, and
                  at seven in the evening, got without the N. W. point of the islands lying on the
                  west side of it. The weather being bad, night coming on, and having land on every
                  side of us, I thought it most advisable to tack, and stretch in under the point,
                  where we anchored in nineteen fathom. At five in the morning, of the <date>24th</date>, we
                  weighed,* and made sail to the N. W. under our courses and double reefed
                  top-sails, the wind being at S. W. by W. and W. S. W. a strong gale and squally.
                  As the gale would not permit us to come near the land, we had but a slight and
                  distant view of it from the time when we got under sail till noon, during a run of
                  twelve leagues, but we never once lost sight of it. At this time, our latitude, by
                  observation, was <geo select="lat">36° 15′ 20″,</geo> we were not above two miles from a point
                  of land on the main, and three leagues and an half from a very high island, which
                  bore N. E. by E.: in this situation we had twenty-six fathom water: the farthest
                  point on the main that we could see bore N. W. but we could perceive several small
                  islands lying to the north of that direction. The point of land of which we were
                  now a-breast, and which I called POINT RODNEY, is the N. W. extremity of the river
                  Thames; for under that name I comprehend the deep bay which terminates in the
                  fresh water stream, and the N. E. extremity is the promontory which we passed when
                  we entered it, and <pb n="356"/> which I called CAPE COLVILLE,* in honour of the
                  Right Honourable Lord Colville. </p><p n="657">Cape Colville lies in latitude <geo select="lat" n="45">36° 26′</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon" n="45">194°
                     27′</geo>; it rises directly from the sea to a considerable height, and is
                  remarkable for a lofty rock, which stands to the pitch of the point, and may be
                  distinguished at a very great distance. From the south point of this Cape the
                  river runs in a direct line S. by E. and is no where less than three leagues broad
                  for the distance of fourteen leagues above the Cape, and there it is contracted to
                  a narrow stream, but continues the same course through a low flat country, or
                  broad valley, which lies parallel with the sea coast, and the end of which we
                  could not see. On the east side of the broad part of this river the land is
                  tolerably high and hilly; on the west side it is rather low, but the whole is
                  covered with verdure and wood, and has the appearance of great fertility, though
                  there were but a few small spots which had been cultivated. At the entrance of the
                  narrow part of the river the land is covered with mangroves and other shrubs; but
                  farther, there are immense woods of perhaps the finest timber in the world, of
                  which some account has already been given: in several places the wood extends to
                  the very edge of the water, and where it is at a little distance, the intermediate
                  space is marshy, like some parts of the banks of the Thames in England: it is
                  probable that the river contains plenty of fish, for we saw poles stuck up in many
                  places to set nets for catching them, but of what kinds I do not know. The
                  greatest depth of water that we found in this river was six and twenty fathom,
                  which gradually decreased to one fathom and an half: in the mouth of the fresh
                  water stream it is from four to three fathom, but there are large flats and sand
                  banks lying before it. A ship of moderate draught may, notwithstanding, go a long
                  way up this river with a flowing <pb n="357"/> tide, for it rises perpendicularly
                  near ten feet,* and at the full and change of the moon, it is high water about
                  nine o'clock. </p><p n="658">Six leagues within Cape Colville, under the eastern shore, are several
                  small islands, which, together with the main, seem to form good harbours; and
                  opposite to these islands, under the western shore, lie other islands, by which it
                  is also probable that good harbours may be formed: but if there are no harbours
                  about this river, there is good anchoring in every part of it where the depth of
                  water is sufficient, for it is defended from the sea by a chain of islands of
                  different extent, which lie cross the mouth of it, and which I have, for that
                  reason, called BARRIER ISLANDS: they stretch N. W. and S. E. ten leagues. The
                  south end of the chain lies N. E. between two and three leagues from Cape
                  Colville; and the north end lies N. E. four leagues and an half from Point Rodney.
                  Point Rodney lies W. N. W. nine leagues from Cape Colville, in latitude <geo select="lat" n="46">36°
                     15′ S</geo>. longitude <geo select="lon" n="46">184° 53′ W</geo>. </p><p n="659">The natives residing about this river do not appear to be numerous,
                  considering the great extent of the country. But they are a strong, well-made, and
                  active people, and all of them paint their bodies with red oker and oil from head
                  to foot, which we had not seen before. Their canoes were large and well built, and
                  adorned with carving, in as good a taste as any that we had seen upon the coast. </p><p n="660">We continued to stand along the shore till night, with the main land on
                  one side, and islands on the other, and then anchored in a bay, with fourteen
                  fathom and a sandy bottom. We had no sooner come to an anchor, than we tried our
                  lines, and in a short time caught near one hundred fish, which the people called
                  Sea-bream; they weighed from six to eight pounds a piece, and consequently would
                  supply the whole ship's company with food for two days. From the <pb n="358"/>
                  success of our lines here, we called the place BREAM BAY:* the two points that
                  form it lie north and south, five leagues from each other; it is every where of a
                  good breadth, and between three and four leagues deep: at the bottom of it there
                  appears to be a river of fresh water. The north head of the bay, called BREAM
                  HEAD, is high land, and remarkable for several pointed rocks, which stand in a
                  range upon the top of it: it may also be known by some small islands which lie
                  before it, called the HEN AND CHICKENS, one of which is high, and terminates in
                  two peaks. It lies in latitude <geo select="lat">35° 46′ S</geo>., and at the distance of
                  seventeen leagues and an half from Cape Colville, in the direction of N. 41 W. </p><p n="661">The land between Point Rodney and Bream Head, an extent of ten leagues, is
                  low, and wooded in tufts, with white sand banks between the sea and the firm land.
                  We saw no inhabitants, but many fires in the night; and where there are fires,
                  there are always people. </p><p n="662">*At day-break, on the <date>25th</date>, we left the bay, and steered along shore to
                  the northward: we found the variation of the compass to be <geo select="lon">12° 42′ E</geo>.
                  At noon, our latitude was <geo select="lat">36° 36′ S</geo>., Bream Head bore south, distant
                  ten miles; and we saw some small islands, to which I gave the name of the POOR
                  KNIGHTS, at N. E. by N. distant three leagues; the northermost land in sight bore
                  N. N. W.: we were in this place at the distance of two miles from the shore, and
                  had twenty-six fathom water. </p><p n="663">The country appeared low, but well covered with wood: we saw some
                  straggling houses, three or four fortified towns, and near them a large quantity
                  of cultivated land. </p><p n="664">In the evening, seven large canoes came off to us, with about two hundred
                  men: some of them came on board, and said that they had heard of us. To two of
                  them, who appeared <pb n="359"/> to be Chiefs, I gave presents;* but when these
                  were gone out of the ship, the others became exceedingly troublesome. Some of
                  those in the canoes began to trade, and, according to their custom, to cheat, by
                  refusing to deliver what had been bought, after they had received the price: among
                  these was one who had received an old pair of black breeches, which, upon a few
                  small shot being fired at him, he threw into the sea. All the boats soon after
                  paddled off to some distance, and when they thought they were out of reach, they
                  began to defy us, by singing their song and brandishing their weapons. We thought
                  it advisable to intimidate them, as well for their sakes as our own, and therefore
                  fired first some small arms, and then round shot over their heads; the last put
                  them in a terrible fright, though they received no damage, except by over-heating
                  themselves in paddling away, which they did with astonishing expedition. </p><p n="665">In the night we had variable light airs;* but towards the morning a breeze
                  sprung up at S. and afterwards at S. E. with which we proceeded slowly to the
                  northward, along the shore. </p><p n="666">Between six and seven o'clock two canoes came off, and told us that they
                  had heard of yesterday's adventure, notwithstanding which the people came on
                  board, and traded very quietly and honestly for whatever they had: soon after two
                  canoes came off from a more distant part of the shore; these were of a much larger
                  size, and full of people: when they came near, they called off the other canoes
                  which were along side of the ship, and after a short conference they all came up
                  together. The strangers appeared to be persons of a superior rank; their canoes
                  were well carved with many ornaments, and they had with them a great variety of
                  weapons: <pb n="360"/> they had patoo-patoos both of stone and whalebone,* upon
                  which they appeared to set a great value; they had also ribs of whale, of which we
                  had before seen imitations in wood, carved and adorned with tufts of dog's hair.
                  Their complexions were browner than those of the people we had seen to the
                  southward, and their bodies and faces were more marked with the black stains which
                  they call Amoco: they had a broad spiral on each buttock; and the thighs of many
                  of them were almost intirely black, some narrow lines only being left untouched,
                  so that at first sight they appeared to wear striped breeches. With respect to the
                  Amoco, every different tribe seemed to have a different custom, for all the men,
                  in some canoes, seemed to be almost covered with it, and those in others had
                  scarcely a stain, except on the lips, which were black in all of them without a
                  single exception. These gentlemen, for a long time, refused to part with any of
                  their weapons, whatever was offered for them; at last, however, one of them
                  produced a piece of talc, wrought into the shape of an ax, and agreed to sell it
                  for a piece of cloth: the cloth was handed over the ship's side, but his honour
                  immediately put off his canoe with the ax. We had recourse to our usual expedient,
                  and fired a musket ball over the canoe, upon which it put back to the ship, and
                  the piece of cloth was returned; all the boats then went ashore, without offering
                  any further intercourse. </p><p n="667">At noon, the main land extended from S. by E. to N. W. by W. a remarkable
                  point of land bearing W. distant four or five miles; at three we passed it, and I
                  gave it the name of CAPE BRET, in honour of Sir Piercy. The land of this Cape is
                  considerably higher than any part of the adjacent coast: at the point of it, is a
                  high round hillock, and N. E. by N. at the distance of about a mile, is a small
                  high island or rock, which, like several that have already been described, was <pb n="361"/> perforated quite through,* so as to appear like the arch of a bridge.
                  This Cape, or at least some part of it, is by the natives called MOTUGOGOGO, and
                  it lies in latitude <geo select="lat" n="47">35° 10′ 30″ S.</geo> longitude <geo select="lon" n="47">185° 25′ W</geo>. On
                  the west side of it is a large and pretty deep bay, lying in S. W. by W. in which
                  there appeared to be several small islands: the point that forms the N. W.
                  entrance, lies W. ¼ N. at the distance of three or four leagues from Cape Bret,
                  and I distinguished it by the name of POINT POCOCKE. On the west side of the bay
                  we saw several villages, both upon islands and the main, and several very large
                  canoes came off to us, full of people, who made a better appearance than any we
                  had seen yet: they were all stout and well-made; their hair, which was black, was
                  tied up in a bunch on the crown of their heads, and stuck with white feathers. In
                  each of the canoes were two or three Chiefs, whose habits were of the best sort of
                  cloth, and covered with dog's skin, so as to make an agreeable appearance: most of
                  these people were marked with the Amoco, like those who had been alongside of us
                  before: their manner of trading was also equally fraudulent; and the officers
                  neglecting either to punish or fright them, one of the midshipmen who had been
                  defrauded in his bargain, had recourse, for revenge, to an expedient which was
                  equally ludicrous and severe: he got a fishing line, and when the man who had
                  cheated him was close under the ship's side in his canoe, he heaved the lead with
                  so good an aim that the hook caught him by the backside; he then pulled the line,
                  and the man holding back, the hook broke in the shank, and the beard was left
                  sticking in the flesh. </p><p n="668">During the course of this day, though we did not range more than six or
                  eight leagues of the coast, we had alongside and on board the ship between four
                  and five hundred of <pb n="362"/> the natives,* which is a proof that this part of
                  the country is well inhabited. </p><p n="669">*At eight o'clock the next morning, we were within a mile of a group of
                  islands which lie close under the main, at the distance of two and twenty miles
                  from Cape Bret, in the direction of N. W. by W. ½ W. At this place, having but
                  little wind, we lay about two hours, during which time several canoes came off,
                  and sold us some fish, which we called Cavalles, and for that reason I gave the
                  same name to the islands. These people were very insolent, frequently threatening
                  us, even while they were selling their fish; and when some more canoes came up,
                  they began to pelt us with stones. Some small shot were then fired, and hit one of
                  them while he had a stone in his hand, in the very action of throwing it into the
                  ship: they did not, however, desist, till some others had been wounded, and then
                  they went away, and we stood off to sea. </p><p n="670">The wind being directly against us, we kept plying to windward till the
                  <date>29th</date>,* when we had rather lost than gained ground; I therefore bore up for a bay
                  which lies to the westward of Cape Bret; at this time it was about two leagues to
                  leeward of us; and at about eleven o'clock we anchored under the south west side
                  of one of the many islands which line it on the south east, in four fathom and an
                  half water; we shoaled our water to this depth all at once, and if this had not
                  happened I should not have come to an anchor so soon. The Master was immediately
                  sent out with two boats to sound, and he soon discovered that we had got upon a
                  bank, which runs out from the north west end of the island, and that on the
                  outside of it there was from eight to ten fathom. </p><p n="671"><pb n="363"/>In the mean time the natives,* to the number of near four hundred,
                  crouded upon us in their canoes, and some of them were admitted on board: to one,
                  who seemed to be a Chief, I gave a piece of broad cloth, and distributed some
                  trifling presents among the rest. I perceived that some of these people had been
                  about the ship when she was off at sea, and that they knew the power of our
                  fire-arms, for the very sight of a gun threw them into manifest confusion: under
                  this impression they traded very fairly; but the people in one of the canoes took
                  the opportunity of our being at dinner to tow away our buoy: a musket was fired
                  over them without effect, we then endeavoured to reach them with some small shot,
                  but they were too far off: by this time they had got the buoy into their canoe,
                  and we were obliged to fire a musket at them with ball: this hit one of them, and
                  they immediately threw the buoy over board: a round shot was then fired over them,
                  which struck the water and went ashore. Two or three of the canoes immediately
                  landed their people, who ran about the beach, as we imagined, in search of the
                  ball. Tupia called to them, and assured them that while they were honest they
                  should be safe, and with a little persuasion many of them returned to the ship,
                  and their behaviour was such as left us no reason to suspect that they intended to
                  give us any farther trouble. </p><p n="672">After the ship was removed into deeper water, and properly secured, I went
                  with the pinnace and yawl, manned and armed, accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr.
                  Solander, and landed upon the island, which was about three quarters of a mile
                  distant: we observed that the canoes which were about the ship, did not follow us
                  upon our leaving her, which we thought a good sign; but we had no sooner landed
                  than they crouded to different parts of the island and came on shore. We were in a
                  little cove, and in a few minutes were <pb n="364"/> surrounded by two or three
                  hundred people,* some rushing from behind the heads of the cove, and others
                  appearing on the tops of the hills: they were all armed, but they came on in so
                  confused and straggling a manner that we scarcely suspected they meant us any
                  harm, and we were determined that hostilities should not begin on our part. We
                  marched towards them, and then drew a line upon the sand between them and us,
                  which we gave them to understand they were not to pass: at first they continued
                  quiet, but their weapons were held ready to strike, and they seemed to be rather
                  irresolute than peaceable. While we remained in this state of suspense, another
                  party of Indians came up, and now growing more bold as their number increased,
                  they began the dance and song, which are their preludes to a battle: still,
                  however, they delayed the attack, but a party ran to each of our boats, and
                  attempted to draw them on shore; this seemed to be the signal, for the people
                  about us at the same time began to press in upon our line: our situation was now
                  become too critical for us to remain longer inactive, I therefore discharged my
                  musket, which was loaded with small shot, at one of the forwardest, and Mr. Banks
                  and two of the men fired immediately afterwards: this made them fall back in some
                  confusion, but one of the Chiefs, who was at the distance of about twenty yards,
                  rallied them, and running forward waving his patoo-patoo, and calling loudly to
                  his companions, led them to the charge. Dr. Solander, whose piece was not yet
                  discharged, fired at this champion, who stopped short upon feeling the shot, and
                  then ran away with the rest: they did not however disperse, but got together upon
                  a rising ground, and seemed only to want some leader of resolution to renew their
                  attack. As they were now beyond the reach of small shot, we fired with ball, but
                  as none of them took place they still continued in a body, and in <pb n="365"/>
                  this situation we remained about a quarter of an hour:* in the mean time the ship,
                  from whence a much greater number of Indians were seen than could be discovered in
                  our situation, brought her broad-side to bear, and intirely dispersed them, by
                  firing a few shot over their heads. In this skirmish only two of the Indians were
                  hurt with the small shot, and not a single life was lost, which would not have
                  been the case if I had not restrained the men, who, either from fear or the love
                  of mischief, shewed as much impatience to destroy them as a sportsman to kill his
                  game. When we were in quiet possession of our cove, we laid down our arms and
                  began to gather celery, which grew here in great plenty: after a little time we
                  recollected to have seen some of the people hide themselves in a cave of one of
                  the rocks, we therefore went towards the place, when an old Indian, who proved to
                  be the Chief that I had presented with a piece of broad cloth in the morning, came
                  out with his wife and his brother, and in a supplicating posture put themselves
                  under our protection. We spoke kindly to them, and the old man then told us that
                  he had another brother, who was one of those that had been wounded by the small
                  shot, and enquired with much solicitude and concern if he would die. We assured
                  him that he would not, and at the same time put into his hand both a musket ball
                  and some small shot, telling him, that those only who were wounded with the ball
                  would die, and that the others would recover; at the same time assuring him, that
                  if we were attacked again, we should certainly defend ourselves with the ball,
                  which would wound them mortally. Having now taken courage, they came and sat down
                  by us, and as tokens of our perfect amity, we made them presents of such trifles
                  as we happened to have about us. </p><p n="673"><pb n="366"/>*Soon after we re-imbarked in our boats, and having rowed to another
                  cove in the same island, climbed a neighbouring hill, which commanded the country
                  to a considerable distance. The prospect was very uncommon and romantic,
                  consisting of innumerable islands, which formed as many harbours, where the water
                  was as smooth as a mill-pool: we saw also many towns, scattered houses, and
                  plantations, the country being much more populous than any we had seen. One of the
                  towns was very near us, from which many of the Indians advanced, taking great
                  pains to shew us that they were unarmed, and in their gestures and countenances
                  expressing great meekness and humility. In the mean time some of our people, who,
                  when the Indians were to be punished for a fraud, assumed the inexorable justice
                  of a Lycurgus, thought fit to break into one of their plantations, and dig up some
                  potatoes: for this offence I ordered each of them to be punished with twelve
                  lashes, after which two of them were discharged; but the third, insisting that it
                  was no crime in an Englishman to plunder an Indian plantation, though it was a
                  crime in an Indian to defraud an Englishman of a nail, I ordered him back into his
                  confinement, from which I would not release him till he had received six lashes
                  more. </p><p n="674">*On the <date>30th</date>, there being a dead calm, and no probability of our getting
                  to sea, I sent the Master, with two boats to sound the harbour; and all the
                  forenoon had several canoes about the ship, who traded in a very fair and friendly
                  manner. In the evening we went ashore upon the main, where the people received us
                  very cordially; but we found nothing worthy of notice. </p><p n="675">In this bay we were detained by contrary winds and calms several days,
                  during which time our intercourse with the <pb n="367"/> natives was continued in
                  the most peaceable and friendly manner, they being frequently about the ship,* and
                  we ashore, both upon the islands and the main. In one of our visits to the
                  continent, an old man shewed us the instrument they use in staining their bodies,
                  which exactly resembled those that were employed for the same purpose at Otaheite.
                  We saw also the man who was wounded in attempting to steal our buoy: the ball had
                  passed through the fleshy part of his arm, and grazed his breast; but the wound,
                  under the care of Nature, the best surgeon, and a simple diet, the best nurse, was
                  in a good state, and seemed to give the patient neither pain nor apprehension. We
                  saw also the brother of our old Chief, who had been wounded with small shot in our
                  skirmish: they had struck his thigh obliquely, and though several of them were
                  still in the flesh, the wound seemed to be attended with neither danger nor pain.
                  We found among their plantations the morus papyrifera, of which these people, as
                  well as those of Otaheite, make cloth; but here the plant seems to be rare, and we
                  saw no pieces of the cloth large enough for any use but to wear by way of ornament
                  in their ears. </p><p n="676">Having one day landed in a very distant part of the bay, the people
                  immediately fled, except one old man, who accompanied us wherever we went, and
                  seemed much pleased with the little presents we made him. We came at last to a
                  little fort, built upon a small rock, which at high water was surrounded by the
                  sea, and accessible only by a ladder: we perceived that he eyed us with a kind of
                  restless solicitude as we approached it, and upon our expressing a desire to enter
                  it, he told us that his wife was there: he saw that our curiosity was not
                  diminished by this intelligence, and after some hesitation, he said, if we would
                  promise to offer no indecency he would accompany us: our promise was readily
                  given, <pb n="368"/> and he immediately led the way.* The ladder consisted of
                  steps fastened to a pole, but we found the ascent both difficult dangerous. When
                  we entered we found three women, who, the moment they saw us, burst into tears of
                  terror and surprize: some kind words and a few presents soon removed their
                  apprehensions, and put them into good humour. We examined the house of our old
                  friend, and by his interest two others, which were all that the fortification
                  contained, and having distributed a few more presents, we parted with mutual
                  satisfaction. </p><p n="677">*At four o'clock in the morning of the <date>5th of December</date>, we weighed, with a
                  light breeze, but it being variable with frequent calms, we made little way. We
                  kept turning out of the bay till the afternoon, and about ten o'clock we were
                  suddenly becalmed, so that the ship would neither wear nor stay, and the tide or
                  current setting strong, she drove towards land so fast, that before any measures
                  could be taken for her security she was within a cable's length of the breakers:
                  we had thirteen fathom water, but the ground was so foul that we did not dare to
                  drop our anchor; the pinnace therefore was immediately hoisted out to take the
                  ship in tow, and the men, sensible of their danger, exerting themselves to the
                  utmost, and a faint breeze springing up off the land, we perceived with
                  unspeakable joy that she made head way, after having been so near the shore that
                  Tupia, who was not sensible of our hair's breadth escape, was at this very time
                  conversing with the people upon the beach, whose voices were distinctly heard,
                  notwithstanding the roar of the breakers. We now thought all danger was over, but
                  about an hour afterwards, just as the man in the chains had cried "seventeen
                  fathom," the ship struck. The shock threw us all into the utmost consternation;
                  Mr. Banks, who had undressed himself and was stepping into bed, ran hastily up to
                     <pb n="369"/> the deck,* and the man in the chains called out "five fathom;" by
                  this time, the rock on which we had struck being to windward, the ship went off
                  without having received the least damage, and the water very soon deepened to
                  twenty fathom. </p><p n="678">This rock lies half a mile W. N. W. of the northermost or outermost island
                  on the south east side of the bay. We had light airs from the land, with calms,*
                  till nine o'clock the next morning, when we got out of the bay, and a breeze
                  springing up at N. N. W. we stood out to sea. </p><p n="679">This bay, as I have before observed, lies on the west side of Cape Bret,
                  and I named it the BAY OF ISLANDS, from the great number of islands which line its
                  shores, and form several harbours equally safe and commodious, where there is room
                  and depth for any number of shipping. That in which we lay is on the south west
                  side of the south westermost island, called MATUARO, on the south east side of the
                  bay. I have made no accurate survey of this bay, being discouraged by the time it
                  would cost me; I thought also that it was sufficient to be able to affirm that it
                  afforded us good anchorage, and refreshment of every kind. It was not the season
                  for roots, but we had plenty of fish, most of which, however, we purchased of the
                  natives, for we could catch very little ourselves either with net or line. When we
                  shewed the natives our seine, which is such as the King's ships are generally
                  furnished with, they laughed at it, and in triumph produced their own, which was
                  indeed of an enormous size, and made of a kind of grass, which is very strong: it
                  was five fathom deep, and by the room it took up, it could not be less than three
                  or four hundred fathom long. Fishing seems indeed to be the chief business of life
                  in this part of the country; we saw about all their towns a great <pb n="370"/>
                  number of nets,* laid in heaps like hay-cocks, and covered with a thatch to keep
                  them from the weather, and we scarcely entered a house where some of the people
                  were not employed in making them. The fish we procured here were sharks,
                  sting-rays, sea-bream, mullet, mackrel, and some others. </p><p n="680">The inhabitants in this bay are far more numerous than in any other part
                  of the country that we had before visited; it did not appear to us that they were
                  united under one head, and though their towns were fortified, they seemed to live
                  together in perfect amity. </p><p n="681">It is high water in this bay at the full and change of the moon, about
                  eight o'clock, and the tide then rises from six to eight feet perpendicularly. It
                  appears, from such observations as I was able to make of the tides upon the
                  seacoast, that the flood comes from the southward; and I have reason to think that
                  there is a current which comes from the westward, and sets along the shore to the
                  S. E. or S. S. E. as the land happens to lie. </p></div><pb n="371"/><div type="chapter" n="25"><head><l>CHAP.V.</l><l><emph rend="italic"> Range from the Bay of Islands round North Cape to Queen

                  distant ten miles, and our latitude, by observation, was <geo select="lat" n="48">34° 59′ S</geo>.;
                  soon after we made several observations of the sun and moon, the result of which
                  made our longitude <geo select="lon" n="48">185° 36′ W</geo>. The wind being against us, we had made
                  but little way. In the afternoon, we stood in shore, and fetched close tinder the
                  Cavalles, from which islands the main trends W. by N.: several canoes put off and
                  followed us, but a light breeze springing up, I did not chuse to wait for them. I
                  kept standing to the W. N. W. and N. W. till the next morning ten o'clock,* when I
                  tacked and stood in for the shore, from which we were about five leagues distant.
                  At noon, the westermost land in sight bore W. by S. and was about four leagues
                  distant. In the afternoon, we had a gentle breeze to the west, which in the
                  evening came to the south, and continuing so all night,* by day-light brought us
                  pretty well in with the land, seven leagues to the westward of the Cavalles, where
                  we found a deep bay running in S. W. by W. and W. S. W. the bottom of which we
                  could but just see, and there the land appeared to be low and level. To this bay,
                  which I called DOUBTLESS BAY, the entrance is formed by two points, which lie W.
                  N. W. and E. S. E. and are five miles distant from each other. The <pb n="372"/>
                  wind not permitting us to look in here,* we steered for the westermost land in
                  sight, which bore from us W. N. W. about three leagues, but before we got the
                  length of it it fell calm. </p><p n="683">While we lay becalmed, several canoes came off to us, but the people
                  having heard of our guns, it was not without great difficulty that they were
                  persuaded to come under our stern: after having bought some of their cloaths, as
                  well as their fish, we began to make enquiries concerning their country, and
                  learnt, by the help of Tupia, that, at the distance of three days rowing in their
                  canoes, at a place called MOORE-WHENNUA, the land would take a short turn to the
                  southward, and from thence extend no more to the west. This place we concluded to
                  be the land discovered by Tasman, which he called CAPE MARIA VAN DIEMEN, and
                  finding these people so intelligent, we inquired farther, if they knew of any
                  country besides their own: they answered, that they never had visited any other,
                  but that their ancestors had told them, that to the N. W. by N. or N. N. W. there
                  was a country of great extent, called ULIMAROA, to which some people had sailed in
                  a very large canoe; that only part of them returned, and reported, that after a
                  passage of a month they had seen a country where the people eat hogs. Tupia then
                  enquired whether these adventurers brought any hogs with them when they returned;
                  they said No: then, replied Tupia, your story is certainly false, for it cannot be
                  believed that men who came back from an expedition without hogs, had ever visited
                  a country where hogs were to be procured. It is however remarkable,
                  notwithstanding the shrewdness of Tupia's objection, that when they mentioned hogs
                  it was not by description but by name, calling them Booah, the name which is given
                  them in the South-sea islands; but if <pb n="373"/> the animal had been wholly
                  unknown to them,* and they had had no communication with people to whom it was
                  known, they could not possibly have been acquainted with the name. </p><p n="684">About ten o'clock at night, a breeze sprung up at W. N. W. with which we
                  stood off north; and at noon the next day,* the Cavalles bore S. E. by E. distant
                  eight leagues; the entrance of Doubtless Bay S. by W. distant three leagues; and
                  the north west extremity of the land in sight, which we judged to be the main,
                  bore N. W. by W.: our latitude by observation was <geo select="lat">34° 44′ S</geo>. In the
                  evening, we found the variation to be <geo select="lon">12° 41′ E</geo>. by the azimuth, and
                     <geo select="lon">12° 40′</geo> by the amplitude. </p><p n="685">Early in the morning, we stood in with the land,* seven leagues to the
                  westward of Doubtless Bay, the bottom of which is not far distant from the bottom
                  of another large bay, which the shore forms at this place, being separated only by
                  a low neck of land, which juts out into a peninsula that I have called KNUCKLE
                  POINT. About the middle of this bay, which we called SANDY BAY, is a high
                  mountain, standing upon a distant shore, to which I gave the name of MOUNT CAMEL.
                  The latitude here is <geo select="lat" n="49">34° 51′ S</geo>. and longitude <geo select="lon" n="49">186° 50′</geo>. We
                  had twenty-four and twenty-five fathom water, with a good bottom; but there seems
                  to be nothing in this bay that can induce a ship to put into it; for the land
                  about it is utterly barren and desolate, and, except Mount Camel, the situation is
                  low: the soil appears to be nothing but white sand, thrown up in low irregular
                  hills and narrow ridges, lying parallel with the shore. But barren and desolate as
                  this place is, it is not without inhabitants: we saw one village on the west side
                  of Mount Camel, and another on the east side; we saw also five canoes full of
                  people, who pulled after the ship, but could not come up with us. At <pb n="374"/>
                  nine o'clock,* we tacked and stood to the northward; and at noon, the Cavalles
                  bore S. E. by E. distant thirteen leagues; the north extremity of the land in
                  sight, making like an island, bore N. W. ¼ N. distant nine leagues; and Mount
                  Camel bore S. W. by S. distance six leagues. </p><p n="686">The wind being contrary, we kept plying northward till five o'clock in the
                  evening of the <date>12th</date>,* when, having made very little way, we tacked and stood to
                  the N. E. being two leagues to the northward of Mount Camel, and about a mile and
                  a half from the shore, in which situation we had two and twenty fathom water. </p><p n="687">At ten, it began to blow and rain, which brought us under double reefed
                  topsails; at twelve, we tacked and stood to the westward till seven the next
                  morning,* when we tacked and stood again to the N. E. being about a mile to
                  windward of the place where we tacked last night. Soon after it blew very hard at
                  N. N. W. with heavy squalls and much rain, which brought us under our courses, and
                  split the maintop-sail; so that we were obliged to unbend it and bend another: at
                  ten, it became more moderate, and we set the top-sails, double reefed: at noon,
                  having strong gales and heavy weather, we tacked and stood to the westward, and
                  had no land in sight for the first time since we had been upon this coast. </p><p n="688">We had now strong gales at W. and W. S. W.; and at half an hour past three
                  we tacked and stood to the northward. Soon after, a small island lying off Knuckle
                  Point bore S. ½ W. distant half a league. In the evening, having split the fore
                  and mizen topsails, we brought the ship under her courses; and at midnight, we
                  wore, and stood to the southward till five in the morning;* when we tacked and
                  stood to the N. W. and saw land bearing south, at the distance of eight or nine
                     <pb n="375"/> leagues;* by this we discovered that we had fallen much to the
                  leeward since yesterday morning. At noon, our latitude by observation was <geo select="lat">34°
                     6′ S</geo>.; and the same land which we had seen before to the N. W. now bore
                  S. W. and appeared to be the northern extremity of the country. We had a large
                  swell rolling in from the westward, and therefore concluded that we were not
                  covered by any land in that quarter. At eight in the evening, we tacked and stood
                  to the westward, with as much sail as we could bear;* and at noon the next day, we
                  were in latitude <geo select="lon">34° 10′</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon">185° 45′ W</geo>. and by
                  estimation about seventeen leagues from the land, notwithstanding our utmost
                  endeavours to keep in with it. </p><p n="689">On the <date>16th</date>, at six in the morning,* we saw land from the mast-head,
                  bearing S. S. W.; and at noon it bore S. by W. distant fourteen leagues: while we
                  were standing in for the shore we sounded several times, but had no ground with
                  ninety fathom. At eight, we tacked in a hundred and eight fathom, at about three
                  or four miles from the shore, which was the same point of land that we had to the
                  N. W. before we were blown off. At noon it bore S. W. distant about three miles;
                  Mount Camel bore S. by E. distant about eleven leagues, and the westermost land in
                  sight bore S. 75 W.; the latitude by observation was <geo select="lat">34° 20′ S</geo>. At four
                  o'clock, we tacked and stood in shore, in doing which, we met with a strong
                  rippling, and the ship fell fast to leeward, which we imputed to a current setting
                  east. At eight, we tacked and stood off till eight the next morning;* when we
                  tacked and stood in, being about ten leagues from the land: at noon, the point of
                  land which we were near the day before, bore S.S.W. distant five leagues. The wind
                  still continued at west; and at seven o'clock, we tacked in thirty-five fathom,
                  when the point of land which has been mentioned before, bore N.W. by N. distant
                  four or five miles; so that we had not gained <pb n="376"/> one inch to windward
                  the last twenty-four hours,* which confirmed our opinion that there was a current
                  to the eastward. The point of land I called NORTH CAPE, it being the northern
                  extremity of this country. It lies in latitude <geo select="lat" n="50">34° 22′ S</geo>. longitude
                  <geo select="lon" n="50">186° 55′ W</geo>. and thirty-one leagues distant from Cape Bret, in the
                  direction of N. 63 W. It forms the north point of Sandy Bay, and is a peninsula
                  jutting out N. E. about two miles, and terminating in a bluff head that is flat at
                  the top. The isthmus which joins this head to the main land is very low, and for
                  that reason the land of the Cape, from several situations, has the appearance of
                  an island. It is still more remarkable when it is seen from the southward, by the
                  appearance of a high round island at the S. E. point of the Cape; but this also is
                  a deception; for what appears to be an island is a round hill, joined to the Cape
                  by a low narrow neck of land. Upon the Cape we saw a Hippah or village, and a few
                  inhabitants; and on the south east side of it there appears to be anchorage, and
                  good shelter from the south west and north west winds. </p><p n="690">*We continued to stand off and on, making N. W. till noon on the <date>21st</date>,
                  when North Cape bore S. 39 E. distant thirty-eight leagues.* Our situation varied
                  only a few leagues till the <date>23d</date>, when, about seven o'clock in the evening, we saw
                  land from the mast-head,* bearing S. ½ E. At eleven the next morning, we saw it
                  again, bearing S. S. E. at the distance of eight leagues: we now stood to the S.
                  W.; and at four o'clock, the land bore S. E. by S. distant four leagues, and
                  proved to be a small island, with other islands or rocks, still smaller, lying off
                  the south west end of it, and another lying off the north east end, which were
                  discovered by Tasman and called the Three Kings. The principal island lies in
                  latitude <geo select="lat" n="51">34° 12′ S</geo>. longitude <geo select="lon" n="51">187° 48′ W</geo>. and distant
                  fourteen or fifteen leagues from North Cape, in the direction of W. 14 N. At
                  midnight, we <pb n="377"/> tacked and stood to the N. E. till six the next
                  morning,* which was Christmas day, when we tacked and stood to the southward. At
                  noon, the Three Kings bore E. 8 N. distant five or six leagues. The variation this
                  morning by the azimuth was <geo select="lon">11° 25′ E</geo>. </p><p n="691">On the <date>26th</date>, we stood to the southward close upon a wind;* and at noon,
                  were in latitude <geo select="lat" n="52">35° 10′ S</geo>. longitude <geo select="lon" n="52">188° 20′ W</geo>. the Three
                  Kings bearing N. 26 W. distant twenty-two leagues. In this situation we had no
                  land in sight; and yet, by observation, we were in the latitude of the Bay of
                  Islands; and by my reckoning but twenty leagues to the westward of North Cape:
                  from whence it appears, that the northern part of this island is very narrow; for
                  otherwise we must have seen some part of the west side of it. We stood to the
                  southward till twelve at night, and then tacked and stood to the northward. </p><p n="692">At four o'clock in the morning, the wind freshened,* and at nine, blew a
                  storm; so that we were obliged to bring the ship to under her mainsail. Our course
                  made good between noon this day and yesterday was S. S. W. ½ W. distance eleven
                  miles. The Three Kings bore N. 27 E. distant seventy-seven miles. The gale
                  continued all this day, and till two the next morning, when it fell,* and began to
                  veer to the southward and S. W. where it fixed about four, when we made sail and
                  steered east in for the land, under the fore-sail and main-sail; but the wind then
                  rising, and by eight o'clock being increased to a hurricane, with a prodigious
                  sea, we were obliged to take in the main-sail; we then wore the ship, and brought
                  her to with her head to the north west. At noon the gale was somewhat abated, but
                  we had still heavy squalls. Our course made good this day, was north, a little
                  easterly, twenty-nine miles; latitude by account <geo select="lat" n="53">34° 50′ S</geo>. <pb n="378"/> longitude <geo select="lon" n="53">188° 27′ W</geo>.;* the Three Kings bore N. 41 E. distant
                  fifty-two miles. At seven o'clock in the evening, the wind being at S. W. and S.
                  W. by W. with hard squalls, we wore and lay on the other tack;* and at six the
                  next morning spread more sail. Our course and distance since yesterday was E. by
                  N. twenty-nine miles. In the afternoon, we had hard squalls at S. W.; and at eight
                  in the evening, wore and stood to the N. W. till five the next morning;* and then
                  wore and stood to the S. E. At six, we saw the land bearing N. E. distant about
                  six leagues, which we judged to be Cape Maria Van Diemen, and which corresponded
                  with the account that had been given of it by the Indians. At midnight we wore and
                  stood to the S. E.* And on the next day at noon, Cape Maria Van Diemen bore N. E.
                  by N. distant about five leagues. At seven in the evening, we tacked and stood to
                  the westward, with a moderate breeze at S. W. by S. and S. W. Mount Camel then
                  bore N. 83 E. and the northermost land, or Cape Maria Van Diemen, N. by W.; we
                  were now distant from the nearest land about three leagues, where we had something
                  more than forty fathom water; and it must be remarked, that Mount Camel, which
                  when seen on the other side did not seem to be more than one mile from the sea,
                  seemed to be but little more when seen from this side; which is a demonstration
                  that the land here cannot be more than two or three miles broad, or from sea to
                  sea. </p><p n="693">*At six o'clock in the morning of January the <date>1st</date>, 1770, being New-year's
                  Day, we tacked and stood to the eastward, the Three Kings bearing N. W. by N. At
                  noon, we tacked again, and stood to the westward, being in latitude <geo select="lat">34° 37′
                     S</geo>.; the Three Kings bearing N. W. by N. at the distance of ten or eleven
                  leagues; and Cape Maria Van Diemen N. 31 E. distant about four leagues and an
                  half: in this situation we had fifty-four fathom water. </p><p n="694"><pb n="379"/>During this part of our navigation two particulars are very
                  remarkable;* in latitude <geo select="lat">35° S</geo>. and in the midst of summer, I met with
                  a gale of wind, which for its strength and continuance was such as I had scarcely
                  ever been in before, and we were three weeks in getting ten leagues to the
                  westward, and five weeks in getting fifty leagues, for at this time it was so long
                  since we passed Cape Bret. During the gale, we were happily at a considerable
                  distance from the land, otherwise it is highly probable that we should never have
                  returned to relate our adventures. </p><p n="695">At five o'clock in the evening, having a fresh breeze to the westward, we
                  tacked and stood to the southward: at this time North Cape bore E. ¾ N. and just
                  open of a point that lies three leagues W. by N. from it. </p><p n="696">This Cape, as I have observed before, is the northermost extremity of this
                  country, and the eastermost point of a peninsula, which runs out N. W. and N. W.
                  by N. seventeen or eighteen leagues, and of which Cape Maria Van Diemen is the
                  westermost point. Cape Maria lies in latitude <geo select="lat" n="54">34° 30′ S</geo>. longitude
                  <geo select="lon" n="54">187° 18′ W</geo>.; and from this point the land trends away S. E. by S.
                  and S. E. beyond Mount Camel, and is every where a barren shore, consisting of
                  banks of white sand. </p><p n="697">On the <date>2d</date>, at noon,* we were in latitude <geo select="lat">35° 17′ S</geo>. and Cape
                  Maria bore north, distant about sixteen leagues, as near as we could guess; for we
                  had no land in sight, and did not dare to go nearer, as a fresh gale blew right on
                  shore, with a rolling sea. The wind continued at W. S. W. and S. W. with frequent
                  squalls; in the evening we shortened sail, and at midnight tacked, and made a trip
                  to the N. W. till two in the morning, when we wore and stood to the southward.* At
                  break of day, we made sail, and edged away, in order to make <pb n="380"/> land;*
                  and at ten o'clock, we saw it, bearing N. W. It appeared to be high, and at noon
                  extended from N. to E. N. E. distant by estimation eight or ten leagues. Cape
                  Maria then bore N. <geo select="lon">2° 30′ W</geo>. distant thirty-three leagues; our latitude
                  by observation was <geo select="lat">36° 2′ S</geo>. About seven o'clock in the evening, we
                  were within six leagues of it; but having a fresh gale upon it, with a rolling
                  sea, we hauled our wind to the S. E. and kept on that course close upon the wind
                  all night, sounding several times, but having no ground with one hundred, and one
                  hundred and ten fathom. </p><p n="698">*At eight o'clock the next morning, we were about five leagues from the
                  land, and off a place which lies in latitude <geo select="lat">36° 25′</geo> and had the
                  appearance of a bay or inlet. It bore east; and in order to see more of it, we
                  kept on our course till eleven o'clock, when we were not more than three leagues
                  from it, and then discovered that it was neither inlet nor bay, but a tract of low
                  land, bounded by higher lands on each side, which produced the deception. At this
                  time, we tacked and stood to the N. W.; and at noon, the land was not distant more
                  than three or four leagues. We were now in latitude <geo select="lat" n="55">36° 31′ S</geo>.
                  longitude <geo select="lon" n="55">185° 50′ W</geo>. Cape Maria bore N. 25 W. distant forty-four
                  leagues and an half; so that the coast must be almost strait in the direction of
                  S. S. E. ¾ E. and N. N. W. ¾ W. nearly. In about latitude <geo select="lat">35° 45′</geo> is
                  some high land adjoining to the sea; to the southward of which the shore is also
                  high, and has the most desolate and inhospitable appearance that can be imagined.
                  Nothing is to be seen but hills of sand, on which there is scarcely a blade of
                  verdure; and a vast sea, impelled by the westerly winds, breaking upon it in a
                  dreadful surf, renders it not only forlorn, but frightful; complicating the idea
                  of danger with desolation, and impressing the mind at once with a sense of <pb n="381"/> misery and death.* From this place I steered to the northward,
                  resolving never more to come within the same distance of the coast, except the
                  wind should be very favourable indeed. I stood under a fresh sail all the day,
                  hoping to get an offing by the next noon, and we made good a course of a hundred
                  and two miles N. 38 W. Our latitude by observation was <geo select="lat">35° 10′ S</geo>.; and
                  Cape Maria bore N. 10 E. distance forty-one miles. In the night, the wind shifted
                  from S. W. by S. to S. and blew fresh.* Our course to the noon of the <date>5th</date> was N.
                  75 W. distance eight miles. </p><p n="699">At day-break on the <date>6th</date>,* we saw the land which we took to be Cape Maria,
                  bearing N. N. E. distant eight or nine leagues: and on the <date>7th</date>, in the afternoon,*
                  the land bore east: and some time after, we discovered a turtle upon the water;
                  but being awake, it dived instantly, so that we could not take it. At noon, the
                  high land, which has just been mentioned, extended from N. to E. at the distance
                  of five or six leagues; and in two places, a flat gave it the appearance of a bay
                  or inlet. The course that we made good the last four and twenty hours was S. 33 E.
                  fifty-three miles; Cape Maria bearing N. 25 W. distant thirty leagues. </p><p n="700">We sailed within sight of land all this day, with gentle gales between the
                  N. E. and N. W.;* and by the next noon had sailed sixty-nine miles, in the
                  direction of S. 37 E.; our latitude by observation was <geo select="lat">36° 39′ S</geo>. The
                  land which on the <date>4th</date> we had taken for a bay, now bore N. E. by N. distant five
                  leagues and an half; and Cape Maria N. 29 W. forty-seven leagues. </p><p n="701">On the <date>9th</date>,* we continued a south east course till eight o'clock in the
                  evening, having run seven leagues since noon, with the wind at N. N. E. and N. and
                  being within three or four leagues of the land, which appeared to be low and <pb n="382"/> sandy.* I then steered S. E. by S. in a direction parallel with the
                  coast, having from forty-eight to thirty-four fathom water, with a black sandy
                  bottom. At day-break the next morning, we found ourselves between two and three
                  leagues from the land, which began to have a better appearance, rising in gentle
                  slopes, and being covered with trees and herbage. We saw a smoke and a few houses,
                  but it appeared to be but thinly inhabited. At seven o'clock, we steered S. by E.
                  and afterwards S. by W. the land lying in that direction. At nine, we were abreast
                  of a point which rises with an easy ascent from the sea to a considerable height:
                  this point, which lies in latitude <geo select="lat">37° 43′</geo>, I named WOODY HEAD. About
                  eleven miles from this Head, in the direction of S. W. ½ W. lies a very small
                  island, upon which we saw a great number of gannets, and which we therefore called
                  GANNET ISLAND. At noon, a high craggy point bore E. N. E. distant about a league
                  and a half, to which I gave the name of ALBETROSS POINT: it lies in latitude
                  <geo select="lat" n="56">38° 4′ S</geo>. longitude <geo select="lon" n="56">184° 42′ W</geo>.; and is distant seven
                  leagues in the direction of S. 17 W. from Woody Head. On the north side of this
                  point the shore forms a bay, in which there appears to be anchorage and shelter
                  for shipping. Our course and distance for the last twenty-four hours was S. 37 E.
                  sixty-nine miles; and at noon this day Cape Maria bore N. 30 W. distant eighty-two
                  leagues. Between twelve and one, the wind shifted at once from N. N. E. to S. S.
                  W. with which we stood to the westward till four o'clock in the afternoon; and
                  then tacked, and stood again in shore till seven; when we tacked again and stood
                  to the westward, having but little wind. At this time, Albetross Point bore N. E.
                  distant near two leagues, and the southermost land in sight bore S. S. W. ½ W.
                  being a very high mountain, and in appearance greatly resembling the Pike of
                  Teneriffe. In this situation we had thirty fathom water, and <pb n="383"/> having
                  but little wind all night,* we tacked about four in the morning, and stood in for
                  the shore. Soon after, it fell calm; and being in forty-two fathom water, the
                  people caught a few sea-bream. At eleven, a light breeze sprung up from the west,
                  and we made sail to the southward. We continued to steer S. by W. and S. S. W.
                  along the shore, at the distance of about four leagues with gentle breezes from
                  between N.W. and N. N. E. At seven in the evening, we saw the top of the Peak to
                  the southward, above the clouds which concealed it below. And at this time, the
                  southermost land in sight bore S. by W. the variation, by several azimuths which
                  were taken both in the morning and the evening, appeared to be <geo select="lon">14° 15′
                     e</geo>asterly. </p><p n="702">At noon on the <date>12th</date>,* we were distant about three leagues from the shore
                  which lies under the Peak, but the Peak itself was wholly concealed by clouds: we
                  judged it to bear about S. S. E.; and some very remarkable peaked islands, which
                  lay under the shore, bore E. S. E. distant three or four leagues. At seven in the
                  evening we sounded, and had forty-two fathom, being distant from the shore between
                  two and three leagues: we judged the Peak to bear east; and after it was dark, we
                  saw fires upon the shore. </p><p n="703">At five o'clock in the morning we saw, for a few minutes,* the summit of
                  the Peak, towering above the clouds, and covered with snow. It now bore N. E.; it
                  lies in latitude <geo select="lat" n="57">39° 16′ S</geo>. longitude <geo select="lon" n="57">185° 15′ W</geo>.; and I
                  named it MOUNT EGMONT, in honour of the Earl. It seems to have a large base, and
                  to rise with a gradual ascent; it lies near the sea, and is surrounded by a flat
                  country, of a pleasant appearance, being clothed with verdure and wood, which
                  renders it the more conspicuous, and the shore under it forms a large cape, which
                  I have named CAPE EGMONT. It lies <pb n="384"/> S.S.W. ½ W. twenty-seven leagues
                  distant from Albetross Point,* and on the north side of it are two small islands,
                  which lie near a remarkable point on the main, that rises to a considerable height
                  in the form of a sugar-loaf. To the southward of the Cape, the land trends away S.
                  E. by E. and S. S. E. and seems to be every where a bold shore. At noon, Cape
                  Egmont bore about N. E.; and in this direction, at about four leagues from the
                  shore, we had forty fathom of water. The wind during the rest of the day was from
                  W. to N. W. by W. and we continued to steer along the shore S. S. E. and S. E. by
                  E. keeping at the distance of between two and three leagues. At half an hour after
                  seven, we had another transient view of Mount Edgcombe, which bore N. 17 W.
                  distant about ten leagues. </p><p n="704">*At five the next morning, we steered S. E. by S. the coast inclining more
                  southerly; and in about half an hour, we saw land bearing S. W. by S. for which we
                  hauled up. At noon the north west extremity of the land in sight bore S. 63 W. and
                  some high land, which had the appearance of an island lying under the main, bore
                  S. S. E. distant five leagues. We were now in a bay, the bottom of which bearing
                  south we could not see, though it was clear in that quarter. Our latitude by
                  observation was <geo select="lat" n="58">40° 97′ S</geo>. longitude <geo select="lon" n="58">184° 39′ W</geo>. At eight in
                  the evening, we were within two leagues of the land which we had discovered in the
                  morning, having run ten leagues since noon: the land which then bore S. 63 W. now
                  bore N. 59 W. at the distance of seven or eight leagues, and had the appearance of
                  an island. Between this land and CAPE EGMONT lies the bay, the west side of which
                  was our situation at this time, and the land here is of a considerable height, and

                  proposed to carry the ship, which was become very foul, in order to careen her,
                  and at the same time repair some defects, and recruit our wood and water. </p><p n="708">With this view, I kept plying on and off all night, having from eighty to
                  sixty-three fathom. At day-break the next morning, I stood for an inlet which runs
                  in S. W.;* and at eight I got within the entrance, which may be known by a reef of
                  rocks, stretching from the north west point, and some rocky islands which lie off
                  the south east point. At nine o'clock, there being little wind, and what there was
                  being variable, we were carried by the tide or current within two cables' length
                  of the north west shore, where we had fifty-four fathom water, but by the help of
                  our boats we got clear. Just at this time we saw a sea-lion rise twice near the
                  shore, the head of which exactly resembled that of the male which has been
                  described in the Account of Lord Anson's Voyage. We also saw some of the natives
                  in a canoe cross the bay, and a village situated upon the point of an island which
                  lies seven or eight miles within the entrance. At noon, we were the length of this
                  island, but there being little wind, the boats <pb n="386"/> were ordered ahead to
                  tow.* About one o'clock, we hauled close round the south west end of the island;
                  and the inhabitants of the village which was built upon it, were immediately up in
                  arms. About two, we anchored in a very safe and convenient cove, on the north west
                  side of the bay, and facing the south west end of the island, in eleven fathom
                  water, with soft ground, and moored with the stream anchor. </p><p n="709">We were about four long cannon shot distant from the the village or
                  Heppah, from which four canoes were immediately dispatched, as we imagined to
                  reconnoitre, and if they should find themselves able, to take us. The men were all
                  well armed, and dressed nearly as they are represented in the figure published by
                  Tasman; two corners of the cloth which they wrapped round the body were passed
                  over the shoulders from behind, and being brought down to the upper edge of it
                  before, were made fast to it just under the breast; but few, or none, had feathers
                  in their hair. They rowed round the ship several times, with their usual tokens of
                  menace and defiance, and at last began the assault by throwing some stones: Tupia
                  expostulated with them, but apparently to very little purpose; and we began to
                  fear that they would oblige us to fire at them, when a very old man in one of the
                  boats expressed a desire of coming on board. We gladly encouraged him in his
                  design, a rope was thrown into his canoe, and she was immediately alongside of the
                  ship: the old man rose up, and prepared to come up the ship's side, upon which all
                  the rest expostulated with great vehemence against the attempt, and at last laid
                  hold of him, and held him back: he adhered however to his purpose with a calm but
                  steady perseverance, and having at length disengaged himself, he came on board. We
                  received him with all possible expressions of friendship and kindness, and <pb n="387"/> after some time dismissed him,* with many presents to his companions.
                  As soon as he was returned on board his canoe, the people in all the rest began to
                  dance, but whether as a token of enmity or friendship we could not certainly
                  determine, for we had seen them dance in a disposition both for peace and war. In
                  a short time, however, they retired to their fort, and soon after I went on shore,
                  with most of the gentlemen, at the bottom of the cove, a-breast of the ship. </p><p n="710">We found a fine stream of excellent water, and wood in the greatest
                  plenty, for the land here was one forest, of vast extent. As we brought the seine
                  with us, we hauled it once or twice, and with such success that we caught near
                  three hundred weight of fish of different sorts, which was equally distributed
                  among the ship's company. </p><p n="711">At day-break, while we were busy in careening the ship,* three canoes came
                  off to us, having on board above a hundred men, besides several of their women,
                  which we were pleased to see, as in general it is a sign of peace; but they soon
                  afterwards became very troublesome, and gave us reason to apprehend some mischief
                  from them to the people that were in our boats alongside the ship. While we were
                  in this situation, the long-boat was sent ashore with some water casks, and some
                  of the canoes attempting to follow her, we found it necessary to intimidate them
                  by firing some small shot: we were at such a distance that it was impossible to
                  hurt them, yet our reproof had its effect, and they desisted from the pursuit.
                  They had some fish in their canoes which they now offered to sell, and which,
                  though it stunk, we consented to buy: for this purpose a man in a small boat was
                  sent among them, and they traded for some time very fairly. At length, however,
                  one of them watching his opportunity, <pb n="388"/> snatched at some paper which
                  our market-man held in his hand,* and missing it, immediately put himself in a
                  posture of defence, flourishing his patoo-patoo, and making show as if he was
                  about to strike; some small shot were then fired at him from the ship, a few of
                  which struck him upon the knee: this put an end to our trade, but the Indians
                  still continued near the ship, rowing round her many times, and conversing with
                  Tupia, chiefly concerning the traditions they had among them with respect to the
                  antiquities of their country. To this subject they were led by the enquiries which
                  Tupia had been directed to make, whether they had ever seen such a vessel as ours,
                  or had ever heard that any such had been upon their coast. These enquiries were
                  all answered in the negative, so that tradition has preserved among them no
                  memorial of Tasman; though, by an observation made this day, we find that we are
                  only fifteen miles south of Murderer's bay, our latitude being <geo select="lat">41° 5′
                     32″,</geo> and Murderer's bay, according to his account, being <geo select="lat">40°
                     50′</geo>. </p><p n="712">The women in these canoes, and some of the men, had a head-dress which we
                  had not before seen. It consisted of a bunch of black feathers, made up in a round
                  form, and tied upon the top of the head, which it intirely covered, and made it
                  twice as high, to appearance, as it was in reality. </p><p n="713">After dinner, I went in the pinnace with Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, Tupia,
                  and some others, into another cove, about two miles distant from that in which the
                  ship lay: in our way we saw something floating upon the water, which we took for a
                  dead seal, but upon rowing up to it, found it to be the body of a woman, which to
                  all appearance had been dead some days. We proceeded to our cove, where we went on
                  shore, and found a small family of Indians, who appeared to be greatly terrified
                  at our approach, and all ran <pb n="389"/> away except one.* A conversation
                  between this person and Tupia soon brought back the rest, except an old man and a
                  child, who still kept aloof, but stood peeping at us from the woods. Of these
                  people, our curiosity naturally led us to enquire after the body of the woman
                  which we had seen floating upon the water: and they acquainted us, by Tupia, that
                  she was a relation, who had died a natural death; and that, according to their
                  custom, they had tied a stone to the body, and thrown it into the sea, which
                  stone, they supposed, had by some accident been disengaged. </p><p n="714">This family, when we came on shore, was employed in dressing some
                  provisions: the body of a dog was at this time buried in their oven, and many
                  provision baskets stood near it. Having cast our eyes carelessly into one of
                  these, as we passed it, we saw two bones pretty cleanly picked, which did not seem
                  to be the bones of a dog, and which, upon a nearer examination, we discovered to
                  be those of a human body. At this sight we were struck with horror, though it was
                  only a confirmation of what we had heard many times since we arrived upon this
                  coast. As we could have no doubt but the bones were human, neither could we have
                  any doubt but that the flesh which covered them had been eaten. They were found in
                  a provision basket; the flesh that remained appeared manifestly to have been
                  dressed by fire, and in the gristles at the end, were the marks of the teeth which
                  had gnawed them: to put an end however to conjecture, founded upon circumstances
                  and appearances, we directed Tupia to ask what bones they were; and the Indians,
                  without the least hesitation, answered, the bones of a man: they were then asked
                  what was become of the flesh, and they replied that they had eaten it; but, said
                  Tupia, why did you not eat the body of the woman which we saw floating upon the
                  water: the woman, said they, died of disease; besides, she <pb n="390"/> was our
                  relation,* and we eat only the bodies of our enemies, who are killed in battle.
                  Upon enquiry who the man was whose bones we had found, they told us, that about
                  five days before, a boat belonging to their enemies came into the bay, with many
                  persons on board, and that this man was one of seven whom they had killed. Though
                  stronger evidence of this horrid practice prevailing among the inhabitants of this
                  coast will scarcely be required, we have still stronger to give. One of us asked
                  if they had any human bones with the flesh remaining upon them, and upon their
                  answering us that all had been eaten, we affected to disbelieve that the bones
                  were human, and said that they were the bones of a dog; upon which one of the
                  Indians with some eagerness took hold of his own fore-arm, and thrusting it
                  towards us, said, that the bone which Mr. Banks held in his hand had belonged to
                  that part of a human body; at the same time, to convince us that the flesh had
                  been eaten, he took hold of his own arm with his teeth, and made shew of eating:
                  he also bit and gnawed the bone which Mr. Banks had taken, drawing it through his
                  mouth, and shewing, by signs, that it had afforded a delicious repast; the bone
                  was then returned to Mr. Banks, and he brought it away with him. Among the persons
                  of this family, there was a woman who had her arms, legs, and thighs frightfully
                  cut in several places; and we were told that she had inflicted the wounds upon
                  herself, in token of her grief for the loss of her husband, who had been lately
                  killed and eaten by their enemies, who had come from some place to the eastward,
                  towards which the Indians pointed. </p><p n="715">The ship lay at the distance of somewhat less than a quarter of a mile
                  from the shore,* and in the morning we were awakened by the singing of the birds:
                  the number was incredible, and they seemed to strain their throats in emulation
                     <pb n="391"/> of each other.* This wild melody was infinitely superior to any
                  that we had ever heard of the same kind; it seemed to be like small bells, most
                  exquisitely tuned, and perhaps the distance, and the water between, might be no
                  small advantage to the sound. Upon enquiry, we were informed that the birds here
                  always began to sing about two hours after midnight, and continuing their musick
                  till sun-rise, were, like our nightingales, silent the rest of the day. In the
                  forenoon, a small canoe came off from the Indian village to the ship, and among
                  those that were in it, was the old man who had first come on board at our arrival
                  in the bay. As soon as it came alongside, Tupia renewed the conversation, that had
                  passed the day before, concerning their practice of eating human flesh, during
                  which they repeated what they had told us already: but, said Tupia, where are the
                  heads? do you eat them too? Of the heads, said the old man, we eat only the
                  brains, and the next time I come I will bring some of them to convince you that
                  what we have told you is truth. After some farther conversation between these
                  people and Tupia, they told him that they expected their enemies to come very
                  shortly, to revenge the death of the seven men whom they had killed and eaten. </p><p n="716">On the <date>18th</date>, the Indians were more quiet than usual,* no canoe came near
                  the ship, nor did we see one of them moving on the shore, their fishing, and other
                  usual occupations being totally suspended. We thought they expected an attack on
                  this day, and therefore attended more diligently to what passed on shore; but we
                  saw nothing to gratify our curiosity. </p><p n="717">After breakfast, we went out in the pinnace, to take a view of the bay,
                  which was of vast extent, and consisted of numberless small harbours and coves, in
                  every direction: we <pb n="392"/> confined our excursion,* however, to the western
                  side, and the country being an impenetrable forest where we landed, we could see
                  nothing worthy of notice: we killed, however, a good number of shaggs, which we
                  saw sitting upon their nests in the trees, and which, whether roasted or stewed,
                  we considered as very good provision. As we were returning, we saw a single man in
                  a canoe fishing; we rowed up to him, and to our great surprize he took not the
                  least notice of us, but even when we were alongside of him, continued to follow
                  his occupation, without adverting to us any more than if we had been invisible. He
                  did not, however, appear to be either sullen or stupid: we requested him to draw
                  up his net, that we might examine it, and he readily complied: it was of a
                  circular form, extended by two hoops, and about seven or eight feet in diameter:
                  the top was open, and sea-ears were fastened to the bottom as a bait: this he let
                  down so as to lie upon the ground, and when he thought fish enough were assembled
                  over it, he drew it up by a very gentle and even motion, so that the fish rose
                  with it, scarcely sensible that they were lifted, till they came very near the
                  surface of the water, and then were brought out in the net by a sudden jerk. By
                  this simple method he had caught abundance of fish, and indeed they are so plenty
                  in this bay, that the catching them requires neither much labour nor art. </p><p n="718">This day, some of our people found in the skirts of the wood, near a hole
                  or oven, three human hip-bones, which they brought on board; a farther proof that
                  these people eat human flesh: Mr. Monkhouse, our Surgeon, also brought on board,
                  from a place where he saw many deserted houses, the hair of a man's head, which he
                  had found, among many other things, tied up to the branches of trees. </p><p n="719"><pb n="393"/>In the morning of the <date>19th</date>,* we set up the armourer's forge to repair
                  the braces of the tiller, and other iron-work, all hands on board being still busy
                  in careening, and other necessary operations about the vessel: this day, some
                  Indians came on board from another part of the bay, where they said there was a
                  town which we had not seen: they brought plenty of fish, which they sold for
                  nails, having now acquired some notion of their use; and in this traffick no
                  unfair practice was attempted. </p><p n="720">In the morning of the <date>20th</date>, our old man kept his promise,* and brought on
                  board four of the heads of the seven people who had been so much the subject of
                  our enquiries: the hair and flesh were entire, but we perceived that the brains
                  had been extracted; the flesh was soft, but had by some method been preserved from
                  putrefaction, for it had no disagreeable smell. Mr. Banks purchased one of them,
                  but they sold it with great reluctance, and could not by any means be prevailed
                  upon to part with a second; probably they may be preserved as trophies, like the
                  scalps in America, and the jaw-bones in the islands of the South Seas. Upon
                  examining the head which had been bought by Mr. Banks, we perceived that it had
                  received a blow upon the temples, which had fractured the skull. This day we made
                  another excursion in the pinnace, to survey the bay, but we found no flat large
                  enough for a potatoe garden, nor could we discover the least appearance of
                  cultivation: we met not a single Indian, but found an excellent harbour; and about
                  eight o'clock in the evening returned on board the ship. </p><p n="721">On the <date>21st</date>,* Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander went a fishing with hook and
                  line, and caught an immense quantity every where upon the rocks, in between four
                  and five fathom water: the seine was hauled every night, and seldom failed <pb n="394"/> to supply the whole ship's company with as much fish as they could
                  eat.* This day all the people had leave to go on shore at the watering-place, and
                  divert themselves as they should think proper. </p><p n="722">*In the morning of the <date>22d</date>, I set out again in the pinnace, accompanied by
                  Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, with a design to examine the head of the inlet, but
                  after rowing about four or five leagues without so much as coming in sight of it,
                  the wind being contrary, and the day half spent, we went on shore on the south
                  east side, to try what might be discovered from the hills. </p><p n="723">Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander immediately employed themselves in botanizing
                  near the beach, and I, taking a seaman with me, ascended one of the hills: when I
                  reached the summit, I found a view of the inlet intercepted by hills, which in
                  that direction rose still higher, and which were rendered inaccessible by
                  impenetrable woods; I was, however, abundantly compensated for my labour, for I
                  saw the sea on the eastern side of the country, and a passage leading from it to
                  that on the west, a little to the eastward of the entrance of the inlet where the
                  ship now lay. The main land which lay on the south east side of this inlet,
                  appeared to be a narrow ridge of very high hills, and to form part of the south
                  west side of the streight; the land on the opposite side appeared to trend away
                  east as far as the eye could reach; and to the south east there appeared to be an
                  opening to the sea, which washed the eastern coast: on the east side of the inlet
                  also I saw some islands which I had before taken to be part of the main land.
                  Having made this discovery, I descended the hill, and as soon as we had taken some
                  refreshment, we set out on our return to the ship. In our way, we examined the
                  harbours and coves which lie behind the <pb n="395"/> islands that I had
                  discovered from the hill;* and in this rout we saw an old village, in which there
                  were many houses that seemed to have been long deserted: we also saw another
                  village which was inhabited, but the day was too far spent for us to visit it, and
                  we therefore made the best of our way to the ship, which we reached between eight
                  and nine o'clock at night. </p><p n="724">The <date>23d</date> I employed in carrying on a survey of the place;* and upon one of
                  the islands where I landed, I saw many houses which seemed to have been long
                  deserted, and no appearance of any inhabitant. </p><p n="725">On the <date>24th</date>,* we went to visit our friends at the Hippah or village on the
                  point of the island near the ship's station, who had come off to us on our first
                  arrival in the bay. They received us with the utmost confidence and civility,
                  shewing us every part of their habitations, which were commodious and neat. The
                  island or rock on which this town is situated, is divided from the main by a
                  breach or fissure so narrow, that a man might almost leap from one to the other:
                  the sides of it are every where so steep as to render the artificial fortification
                  of these people almost unnecessary: there was, however, one slight pallisade, and
                  one small fighting-stage, towards that part of the rock where access was least
                  difficult. </p><p n="726">The people here brought us out several human bones, the flesh of which
                  they had eaten, and offered them to sale; for the curiosity of those among us who
                  had purchased them as memorials of the horrid practice which many, notwithstanding
                  the reports of travellers, have professed not to believe, had rendered them a kind
                  of article of trade. In one part of this village we observed, not without some
                  surprize, a cross exactly like that of a crucifix; it was adorned with feathers,
                     <pb n="396"/> and upon our enquiring for what purpose it had been set up,* we
                  were told that it was a monument for a man who was dead: we had before understood
                  that their dead were not buried, but thrown into the sea; but to our enquiry how
                  the body of the man had been disposed of, to whose memory this cross had been
                  erected, they refused to answer. </p><p n="727">When we left these people, we went to the other end of the island, and
                  there taking water, crossed over to the main, where we saw several houses, but no
                  inhabitants, except a few in some straggling canoes, that seemed to be fishing,
                  After viewing this place, we returned on board the ship to dinner. </p><p n="728">During our visit to the Indians this day, Tupia being always of our party,
                  they had been observed to be continually talking of guns, and shooting people: for
                  this subject of their conversation we could not at all account; and it had so much
                  engaged our attention, that we talked of it all the way back, and even after we
                  got on board the ship: we had perplexed ourselves with various conjectures, which
                  were all given up in their turn; but now we learnt, that on the <date>21st</date> one of our
                  officers, upon pretence of going out to fish, had rowed up to the Hippah, and that
                  two or three canoes coming off towards his boat, his fears suggested that an
                  attack was intended, in consequence of which three muskets were fired, one with
                  small shot, and two with ball, at the Indians, who retired with the utmost
                  precipitation, having probably come out with friendly intentions, for such their
                  behaviour both before and afterwards expressed, and having no reason to expect
                  such treatment from people who had always behaved to them not only with humanity,
                  but kindness, and to whom they were not conscious of having given offence. </p><p n="729"><pb n="397"/>On the <date>25th</date>, I made another excursion along the coast,* in the
                  pinnace, towards the mouth of the inlet, accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr.
                  Solander, and going on shore at a little cove, to shoot shaggs, we fell in with a
                  large family of Indians, whose custom it is to disperse themselves among the
                  different creeks and coves, where fish is to be procured in the greatest plenty,
                  leaving a few only in the Hippah, to which the rest repair in times of danger.
                  Some of these people came out a good way to meet us, and gave us an invitation to
                  go with them to the rest of their party, which we readily accepted. We found a
                  company of about thirty, men, women, and children, who received us with all
                  possible demonstrations of friendship: we distributed among them a few ribands and
                  beads, and in return, received the kisses and embraces of both sexes, both young
                  and old: they gave us also some fish, and after a little time we returned, much
                  pleased with our new acquaintance. </p><p n="730">In the morning of the <date>26th</date>, I went again out in the boat,* with Mr. Banks
                  and Dr. Solander, and entered one of the bays, which lie on the east side of the
                  inlet, in order to get another sight of the streight, which passed between the
                  eastern and western seas. For this purpose, having landed at a convenient place,
                  we climbed a hill of very considerable height, from which we had a full view of
                  it, with the land on the opposite shore, which we judged to be about four leagues
                  distant; but as it was hazey in the horizon, we could not see far to the south
                  east: I resolved however to search the passage with the ship, as soon as I should
                  put to sea. Upon the top of this hill we found a parcel of loose stones, with
                  which we erected a pyramid, and left in it some musket balls, small shot, beads,
                  and other things, which we happened to have about us, that were likely to stand
                  the test of time, and not being of Indian workmanship, would convince <pb n="398"/> any European who should come to the place and pull it down,* that other natives
                  of Europe had been there before him. When this was done, we descended the hill,
                  and made a comfortable meal of the shaggs and fish which our guns and lines had
                  procured us, and which were dressed by the boat's crew in a place that we had
                  appointed: in this place we found another Indian family, who received us, as
                  usual, with strong expressions of kindness and pleasure, shewing us where to
                  procure water, and doing us such other good offices as were in their power. From
                  this place we went to the town, of which the Indians had told us, who visited us
                  on the <date>19th</date>: this, like that which we had seen before, was built upon a small
                  island or rock, so difficult of access, that we gratified our curiosity at the
                  risk of our necks. The Indians here also received us with open arms, carried us to
                  every part of the place, and shewed us all that it contained: this town, like the
                  other, consisted of between eighty and an hundred houses, and had only one
                  fighting-stage. We happened to have with us a few nails and ribands, and some
                  paper, with which our guests were so gratified, that at our coming away they
                  filled our boat with dried fish, of which we perceived they had laid up great
                  quantities. </p><p n="731">*The <date>27th</date> and <date>28th</date> were spent in refitting the ship for the sea, fixing a
                  transom for the tiller, getting stones on board to put into the bottom of the
                  bread-room, to bring the ship more by the stern, in repairing the casks, and
                  catching fish. </p><p n="732">*On the <date>29th</date>, we received a visit from our old man, whose name we found to
                  be TOPAA, and three other natives, with whom Tupia had much conversation. The old
                  man told us, that one of the men who had been fired upon by the officer who had
                  visited their Hippah, under pretence of fishing, was dead; but to my great comfort
                  I afterwards discovered that this report was not true, and that if Topāa's
                  discourses were <pb n="399"/> taken literally, they would frequently lead us into
                  mistakes.* Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander were several times on shore during the last
                  two or three days, not without success, but greatly circumscribed in their walks
                  by climbers of a most luxuriant growth, which were so interwoven together, as to
                  fill up the space between the trees about which they grew, and render the woods
                  altogether impassable. This day also I went on shore again myself, upon the
                  western point of the inlet, and from a hill of considerable height, I had a view
                  of the coast to the N. W. The farthest land I could see in that quarter, was an
                  island which has been mentioned before, at the distance of about ten leagues,
                  lying not far from the main: between this island and the place where I stood, I
                  discovered, close under the shore, several other islands, forming many bays, in
                  which there appeared to be good anchorage for shipping. After I had set off the
                  different points for my survey, I erected another pile of stones, in which I left
                  a piece of silver coin, with some musket balls and beads, and a piece of an old
                  pendant flying on the top. In my return to the ship, I made a visit to several of
                  the natives, whom I saw along the shore, and purchased a small quantity of fish. </p><p n="733">On the <date>30th</date>, early in the morning,* I sent a boat to one of the islands
                  for celery, and while the people were gathering it, about twenty of the natives,
                  men, women, and children, landed near some empty huts: as soon as they were on
                  shore, five or six of the women sat down upon the ground together, and began to
                  cut their legs, arms, and faces, with shells, and sharp pieces of talc or jasper,
                  in a terrible manner. Our people understood that their husbands had lately been
                  killed by their enemies; but while they were performing this horrid ceremony, the
                  men set about repairing the huts, with the utmost negligence and unconcern. </p><p n="734"><pb n="400"/>*The carpenter having prepared two posts to be left as memorials of
                  our having visited this place, I ordered them to be inscribed with the ship's
                  name, and the year and month; one of them I set up at the watering-place, hoisting
                  the Union flag upon the top of it; and the other I carried over to the island that
                  lies nearest to the sea, called by the natives MOTUARA. I went first to the
                  village or Hippah, accompanied by Mr. Monkhouse and Tupia, where I met with our
                  old man, and told him and several others, by means of Tupia, that we were come to
                  set up a mark upon the island, in order to show to any other ship which should
                  happen to come thither, that we had been there before. To this they readily
                  consented, and promised that they never would pull it down: I then gave something
                  to every one present; and to the old man I gave a silver threepence, dated 1736,
                  and some spike nails, with the king's broad arrow cut deep upon them; things which
                  I thought most likely to remain long among them: I then took the post to the
                  highest part of the island, and after fixing it firmly in the ground, I hoisted
                  upon it the Union-flag, and honoured this inlet with the name of QUEEN CHARLOTTE's
                  SOUND, at the same time taking formal possession of this and the adjacent country,
                  in the name and for the use of his Majesty King George the Third. We then drank a
                  bottle of wine to her Majesty's health, and gave the bottle to the old man who had
                  attended us up the hill, and who was mightily delighted with his present. </p><p n="735">While the post was setting up, we enquired of the old man concerning the
                  passage into the eastern sea, the existence of which he confirmed; and then asked
                  him about the land to the S. W. of the streight, where we were then situated: this
                  land, he said, consisted of two Whennuas or islands, which might be
                  circumnavigated in a few days, and which he called TOVY POENAMMOO; the literal
                  translation of this word <pb n="401"/> is "the water of green talc:"* and probably
                  if we had understood him better, we should have found that Tovy Poenammoo was the
                  name of some particular place where they got the green talc or stone of which they
                  make their ornaments and tools, and not a general name for the whole southern
                  district: he said, there was also a third Whennua, on the east side of the
                  streight, the circumnavigation of which would take up many moons: this he called
                  EAHEINOMAUWE; and to the land on the borders of the streight he gave the name of
                  TIERA WITTE. Having set up our post, and procured this intelligence, we returned
                  on board the ship, and brought the old man with us, who was attended by his canoe,
                  in which, after dinner, he returned home. </p><p n="736">On the <date>31st</date>, having completed our wooding,* and filled all our water
                  casks, I sent out two parties, one to cut and make brooms, and another to catch
                  fish. In the evening, we had a strong gate from the N. W. with such a heavy rain
                  that our little wild musicians on shore suspended their song, which till now we
                  had constantly heard during the night, with a pleasure which it was impossible to
                  lose without regret. </p><p n="737">On the <date>1st</date>, the gale increased to a storm,* with heavy gusts from the high
                  land, one of which broke the hawser, that we had fastened to the shore, and
                  obliged us to let go another anchor. Towards midnight, the gale became more
                  moderate, but the rain continued with such violence, that the brook which had
                  supplied us with water overflowed its banks, and carried away ten small casks
                  which had been left there full of water, and notwithstanding we searched the whole
                  cove, we could never recover one of them. </p><p n="738">On the <date>3d</date>, as I intended to sail the first opportunity,* I went over to
                  the Hippah on the east side of the Sound, and purchased a considerable quantity of
                  split and half-dried fish, for <pb n="402"/> sea stores.* The people here
                  confirmed all that the old man had told us concerning the streight and the
                  country, and about noon I took leave of them: some of them seemed to be sorry, and
                  others glad, that we were going: the fish which I had bought they sold freely, but
                  there were some who shewed manifest signs of disapprobation. As we returned to the
                  ship, some of us made an excursion along the shore to the northward, to traffick
                  with the natives for a farther supply of fish, in which, however, they had no
                  great success. In the evening, we got every thing off from the shore, as I
                  intended to sail in the morning, but the wind would not permit. </p><p n="739">*On the <date>4th</date>, while we were waiting for a wind, we amused ourselves by
                  fishing, and gathering shells and seeds of various kinds:* and early in the
                  morning of the <date>5th</date>, we cast off the hawser, hove short on the bower, and carried
                  the kedge anchor out in order to warp the ship out of the cove, which having done
                  about two o'clock in the afternoon, we hove up the anchor and got under sail; but
                  the wind soon failing, we were obliged to come to an anchor again a little above
                  Motuara. When we were under sail, our old man Topāa came on board to take his
                  leave of us, and as we were still desirous of making farther enquiries whether any
                  memory of Tasman had been preserved among these people, Tupia was directed to ask
                  him whether he had ever heard that such a vessel as ours had before visited the
                  country. To this he replied in the negative, but said, that his ancestors had told
                  him there had once come to this place a small vessel, from a distant country,
                  called ULIMAROA, in which were four men, who, upon their coming on shore, were all
                  killed: upon being asked where this distant land lay, he pointed to the northward.
                  Of Ulimaroa we had heard something before, from the people about the Bay of
                  Islands, who <pb n="403"/> said that their ancestors had visited it;* and Tupia
                  had also talked to us of Ulimaroa, concerning which he had some confused
                  traditionary notions, not very different from those of our old man, so that we
                  could draw no certain conclusion from the accounts of either. </p><p n="740">Soon after the ship came to an anchor the second time, Mr. Banks and Dr.
                  Solander went on shore, to see if any gleanings of natural knowlege remained, and
                  by accident fell in with the most agreeable Indian family they had seen, which
                  afforded them a better opportunity of remarking the personal subordination among
                  these people, than had before offered. The principal persons were a widow, and a
                  pretty boy about ten years old: the widow was mourning for her husband with tears
                  of blood, according to their custom, and the child, by the death of its father,
                  was become proprietor of the land where we had cut our wood. The mother and the
                  son were sitting upon matts, and the rest of the family, to the number of sixteen
                  or seventeen, of both sexes, sat round them in the open air, for they did not
                  appear to have any house, or other shelter from the weather, the inclemencies of
                  which, custom has probably enabled them to endure without any lasting
                  inconvenience. Their whole behaviour was affable, obliging, and unsuspicious; they
                  presented each person with fish, and a brand of fire to dress it, and pressed them
                  many times to stay till the morning, which they would certainly have done if they
                  had not expected the ship to sail, greatly regretting that they had not become
                  acquainted with them sooner, as they made no doubt but that more knowlege of the
                  manners and disposition of the inhabitants of this country would have been
                  obtained from them in a day, than they had yet been able to acquire during our
                  whole stay upon the coast. </p><p n="741"><pb n="404"/>*On the <date>6th</date>, about six o'clock in the morning, a light breeze sprung
                  up at north, and we again got under sail, but the wind proving variable, we
                  reached no farther than just without Motuara; in the afternoon, however, a more
                  steady gale at N. by W. set us clear of the Sound, which I shall now describe. </p><p n="742">The entrance of Queen Charlotte's Sound is situated in latitude <geo select="lat" n="59">41°
                  S</geo>. longitude <geo select="lon" n="59">184° 45′ W</geo>. and near the middle of the south west
                  side of the streight in which it lies. The land of the south east head of the
                  Sound, called by the natives KOAMAROO, off which lie two small islands and some
                  rocks, makes the narrowest part of the streight. From the north west head a reef
                  of rocks runs out about two miles, in the direction of N. E. by N.; part of which
                  is above the water, and part below. By this account of the heads, the Sound will
                  be sufficiently known: at the entrance, it is three leagues broad, and lies in
                  S.W. by S. S. W. and W.S.W. at least ten leagues, and is a collection of some of
                  the finest harbours in the world, as will appear from the plan, which is laid down
                  with all the accuracy that time and circumstances would admit. The land forming
                  the harbour or cove in which we lay, is called by the natives TOTARRANUE: the
                  harbour itself, which I called SHIP COVE, is not inferior to any in the Sound,
                  either for convenience or safety: it lies on the west side of the Sound, and is
                  the southermost of three coves, that are situated within the island of Motuara,
                  which bears east of it. Ship Cove may be entered, either between Motuara and a
                  long island, called by the natives HAMOTE, or between Motuara and the western
                  shore. In the last of these channels are two ledges of rocks, three fathom under
                  water, which may easily be known by the sea-weed that grows upon them. In sailing
                  either in or out of the Sound, with little wind, attention <pb n="405"/> must be
                  had to the tides,* which flow about nine or ten o'clock at the full and change of
                  the moon, and rise and fall between seven and eight feet perpendicularly. The
                  flood comes in through the streight from the S. E. and sets strongly over upon the
                  north west head, and the reef that lies off it: the ebb sets with still greater
                  rapidity to the S. E. over upon the rocks and islands that lie off the south east
                  head. The variation of the compass we found from good observation, to be <geo select="lon">13°
                     5′ E</geo>. </p><p n="743">The land about this sound, which is of such a height that we saw it at the
                  distance of twenty leagues, consists wholly of high hills and deep vallies, well
                  stored with a variety of excellent timber, fit for all purposes except masts, for
                  which it is too hard and heavy. The sea abounds with a variety of fish, so that
                  without going out of the cove where we lay, we caught every day, with the seine
                  and hooks and lines, a quantity sufficient to serve the whole ship's company: and
                  along the shore we found plenty of shags, and a few other species of wild-fowl,
                  which those who have long lived upon salt provisions will not think despicable
                  food. </p><p n="744">The number of inhabitants scarcely exceeds four hundred, and they live
                  dispersed along the shores, where their food, consisting of fish and fern roots,
                  is most easily procured; for we saw no cultivated ground. Upon any appearance of
                  danger, they retire to their Hippahs, or forts; in this situation we found them,
                  and in this situation they continued for some time after our arrival. In
                  comparison of the inhabitants of other parts of this country, they are poor, and
                  their canoes are without ornament: the little traffic we had with them was wholly
                  for fish, and indeed they had scarcely any thing else to dispose of. They seemed,
                  however, to have some knowlege of iron, which the inhabitants of some other parts
                     <pb n="406"/> had not;* for they willingly took nails for their fish, and
                  sometimes seemed to prefer it to every thing else that we could offer, which had
                  not always been the case. They were at first very fond of paper; but when they
                  found that it was spoiled by being wet, they would not take it: neither did they
                  set much value upon the cloth of Otaheite; but English broad cloth, and red
                  kersey, were in high estimation; which shewed that they had sense enough to
                  appretiate the commodities which we offered by their use, which is more than could
                  be said of some of their neighbours, who made a much better appearance. Their
                  dress has been mentioned already, particularly their large round head-dresses of
                  feathers, which were far from being unbecoming. </p><p n="745">As soon as we got out of the Sound, I stood over to the eastward, in order
                  to get the streight well open before the tide of ebb came on. At seven in the
                  evening, the two small islands which lie off Cape Koamaroo, the south east head of
                  Queen Charlotte's Sound, bore east, distant about four miles: at this time it was
                  nearly calm, and the tide of ebb setting out, we were, in a very short time,
                  carried by the rapidity of the stream close upon one of the islands, which was a
                  rock rising almost perpendicularly out of the sea: we perceived our danger
                  increase every moment, and had but one expedient to prevent our being dashed to
                  pieces, the success of which a few minutes would determine. We were now within
                  little more than a cable's length of the rock, and had more than seventy-five
                  fathom water; but upon dropping an anchor, and veering about one hundred and fifty
                  fathom of cable, the ship was happily brought up: this, however, would not have
                  saved us, if the tide which set S. by E. had not, upon meeting with the island,
                  changed its direction to S. E. and carried us beyond the first point. In this
                  situation, we were not above two cables' length from the <pb n="407"/> rocks; and
                  here we remained in the strength of the tide,* which set to the S. E. after the
                  rate of at least five miles an hour, from a little after seven till near midnight,
                  when the tide abated, and we began to heave.* By three in the morning the anchor
                  was at the bows, and having a light breeze at N. W. we made sail for the eastern
                  shore; but the tide being against us, we made but little way: the wind however
                  afterwards freshened, and came to N. and N. E. with which, and the tide of ebb, we
                  were in a short time hurried through the narrowest part of the streight, and then
                  stood away for the southermost land we had in sight, which bore from us S. by W.
                  Over this land appeared a mountain of stupendous height, which was covered with
                  snow. </p><p n="746">The narrowest part of the streight, through which we had been driven with
                  such rapidity, lies between Cape Tierawitte, on the coast of Eaheinomauwe, and
                  Cape Koamaroo: the distance between them I judged to be between four or five
                  leagues, and notwithstanding the tide, now its strength is known, may be passed
                  without much danger. It is however safest to keep on the north east shore, for on
                  that side there appeared to be nothing to fear; but on the other shore there are
                  not only the islands and rocks which lie off Cape Koamaroo, but a reef of rocks
                  stretching from these islands six or seven miles to the southward, at the distance
                  of two or three miles from the shore, which I had discovered from the hill when I
                  took my second view of the streight from the east to the western sea. The length
                  of the streight we had passed I shall not pretend to assign, but some judgment may
                  be formed of it from a view of the chart. </p><p n="747">About nine leagues north from Cape Tierawitte, and under the same shore,
                  is a high and remarkable island which may be distinctly seen from Queen
                  Charlotte's Sound, from <pb n="408"/> which it is distant about six or seven
                  leagues.* This island, which was noticed when we passed it on the <date>14th of January</date>,
                  I have called ENTRY ISLE. </p><p n="748">On the east side of Cape Tierawitte, the land trends away S. E. by E.
                  about eight leagues, where it ends in a point, and is the southermost land on
                  Eaheinomauwe. To this point I have given the name of CAPE PALLISER, in honour of
                  my worthy friend Captain Palliser. It lies in latitude <geo select="lat" n="60">41° 34′ S</geo>.
                  longitude <geo select="lon" n="60">183° 58′ W</geo>. and bore from us this day at noon S. 79 E.
                  distant about thirteen leagues, the ship being then in the latitude of <geo select="lat">41°
                     27′ S</geo>.; Koamaroo at the same time bearing N. ½ E. distant seven or eight
                  leagues. The southermost land in sight bore S. 16 W. and the snowy mountain S. W.
                  At this time we were about three leagues from the shore, and abreast of a deep bay
                  or inlet, to which I gave the name of CLOUDY BAY, and at the bottom of which there
                  appeared low land covered with tall trees. </p><p n="749">At three o'clock in the afternoon we were abreast of the southermost point
                  of land that we had seen at noon, which I called CAPE CAMPBEL; it lies S. by W.
                  distant between twelve and thirteen leagues from Cape Koamaroo, in latitude
                  <geo select="lat" n="61">41° 44′ S</geo>. longitude <geo select="lon" n="61">183° 45′ W</geo>.; and with Cape Palliser
                  forms the southern entrance of the streight, the distance between them being
                  between thirteen and fourteen leagues W. by S. and E. by N. </p><p n="750">From this Cape we steered along the shore S.W. by S. till eight o'clock in
                  the evening, when the wind died away. About half an hour afterwards, however, a
                  fresh breeze sprung up at S.W. and I put the ship right before it. My reason for
                  this, was a notion which some of the officers had just started, that Eahienomauwe
                  was not an island, and that the land might stretch away to the S.E. from between
                  Cape <pb n="409"/> Turnagain and Cape Palliser,* there being a space of between
                  twelve and fifteen leagues that we had not seen. I had indeed the strongest
                  conviction that they were mistaken, not only from what I had seen the first time I
                  discovered the streight, but from many other concurrent testimonies that the land
                  in question was an island; but being resolved to leave no possibility of doubt
                  with respect to an object of such importance, I took the opportunity of the wind's
                  shifting, to stand eastward, and accordingly steered N. E. by E. all the night.*
                  At nine o'clock in the morning we were abreast of Cape Palliser, and found the
                  land trend away N. E. towards Cape Turnagain, which I reckoned to be distant about
                  twenty-six leagues: however, as the weather was hazy, so as to prevent our seeing
                  above four or five leagues, I still kept standing to the N. E. with a light breeze
                  at south; and at noon Cape Palliser bore N. 72 W. distant about three leagues. </p><p n="751">About three o'clock in the afternoon, three canoes came up to the ship
                  with between thirty and forty people on board, who had been pulling after us with
                  great labour and perseverance for some time: they appeared to be more cleanly, and
                  a better class, than any we had met with since we left the Bay of Islands, and
                  their canoes were also distinguished by the same ornaments which we had seen upon
                  the northerly part of the coast. They came on board with very little invitation;
                  and their behaviour was courteous and friendly: upon receiving presents from us,
                  they made us presents in return, which had not been done by any of the natives
                  that we had seen before. We soon perceived that our guests had heard of us, for as
                  soon as they came on board, they asked for Whow, the name by which nails were
                  known among the people with whom we had trafficked: but though they had heard of
                  nails, it was plain, they had seen <pb n="410"/> none;* for when nails were given
                  them, they asked Tupia what they were. The term Whow, indeed, conveyed to them the
                  idea not of their quality, but only of their use; for it is the same by which they
                  distinguish a tool, commonly made of bone, which they use both as an augur and a
                  chissel. However, their knowing that we had Whow to sell, was a proof that their
                  connections extended as far north as Cape Kidnappers, which was distant no less
                  than forty-five leagues; for that was the southermost place on this side the coast
                  where we had had any traffic with the natives. It is also probable, that the
                  little knowlege which the inhabitants of Queen Charlotte's Sound had of iron, they
                  obtained from their neighbours at Tierawitte; for we had no reason to think that
                  the inhabitants of any part of this coast had the least knowlege of iron or its
                  use before we came among them, especially as when it was first offered they seemed
                  to disregard it as of no value. We thought it probable, that we were now once more
                  in the territories of Teratu; but upon enquiring of these people, they said that
                  he was not their King. After a short time, they went away, much gratified with the
                  presents that we had made them; and we pursued our course along the shore to the
                  N. E. till eleven o'clock the next morning.* About this time, the weather
                  happening to clear up, we saw Cape Turnagain, bearing N. by E. ½ E. at the
                  distance of about seven leagues: I then called the officers upon deck, and asked
                  them, whether they were not now satisfied, that Eahienomauwe was an island; they
                  readily answered in the affirmative, and all doubts being now removed, we hauled
                  our wind to the eastward. </p></div></div><milestone unit="volume"><!--END OF THE SECOND VOLUME.--></milestone><div type="book" n="2"><head><l>AN ACCOUNT OF A VOYAGE round the WORLD.

                  tacked,* we stood S. W. and continued to make sail to the southward till sunset on
                  the <date>11th</date>, when a fresh breeze at N. E. had carried us back again the length of
                  Cape Palliser, of which as the weather was clear we had a good view. Between the
                  foot of the high land and the sea there is a low flat border, off which there are
                  some rocks that appear above water. Between this Cape and Cape Turnagain, the land
                  near the shore is, in many places, low and flat, and has a green and pleasant
                  appearance; but farther from the sea it rises into hills. The land between <pb n="412"/> Cape Palliser and Cape Tierawitte is high and makes in table-points;*
                  it also seemed to us to form two bays, but we were at too great a distance from
                  this part of the coast, to judge accurately from appearances. The wind having been
                  variable, with calms, we had advanced no farther by the <date>12th</date> at noon than latitude
                  <geo select="lat">41° 52′</geo>,* Cape Palliser then bearing north, distant about five
                  leagues; and the snowy mountain S. 83 W. </p><p n="753">*At noon on the <date>13th</date>, we found ourselves in the latitude of <geo select="lat">42° 2′
                     S</geo>.; Cape Palliser bearing N. 20 E. distant eight leagues. In the
                  afternoon, a fresh gale sprung up at N. E. and we steered S. W. by W. for the
                  southermost land in sight, which at sunset bore from us S. 74 W. At this time the
                  variation was <geo select="lon">15° 4′ E</geo>. </p><p n="754">*At eight o'clock in the morning of the <date>14th</date>, having run one and twenty
                  leagues S. 58 W. since the preceding noon, it fell calm. We were then abreast of
                  the snowy mountain which bore from us N. W. and in this direction lay behind a
                  mountainous ridge of nearly the same height, which rises directly from the sea,
                  and runs parallel with the shore, which lies N. E. ½ N. and S. W. ½ S. The north
                  west end of the ridge rises inland, not far from Cape Campbell; and both the
                  mountain and the ridge are distinctly seen as well from Cape Koamaroo as Cape
                  Palliser: from Koamaroo they are distant two and twenty leagues S. W. ½ S.; and
                  from Cape Palliser thirty leagues W. S. W.; and are of a height sufficient to be
                  seen at a much greater distance. At noon this day, we were in latitude <geo select="lat">42°
                     347′S</geo>. The southermost land in sight bore S. W. ½ W.; and some low land
                  that appeared like an island, and lay close under the foot of the ridge, bore N.
                  W. by N. about five or six leagues. </p><p n="755"><pb n="413"/>In the afternoon,* when Mr. Banks was out in the boat a shooting, we
                  saw, with our glasses, four double canoes, having on board fifty-seven men, put
                  off from that shore, and make towards him: we immediately made signals for him to
                  come on board; but the ship, with respect to him, being right in the wake of the
                  sun, he did not see them. We were at a considerable distance from the shore, and
                  he was at a considerable distance from the ship, which was between him and the
                  shore; so that, it being a dead calm, I began to be in some pain for him, fearing
                  that he might not see the canoes time enough to reach the ship before they should
                  get up with him: soon after, however, we saw his boat in motion, and had the
                  pleasure to take him on board before the Indians came up, who probably had not
                  seen him, as their attention seemed to be wholly fixed upon the ship. They came
                  within about a stone's cast, and then stopped, gazing at us with a look of vacant
                  astonishment: Tupia exerted all his eloquence to prevail upon them to come nearer,
                  but without any effect. After surveying us for some time, they left us, and made
                  towards the shore; but had not measured more than half the distance between that
                  and the ship before it was dark. We imagined that these people had heard nothing
                  of us, and could not but remark the different behaviour and dispositions of the
                  inhabitants of the different parts of this coast upon their first approaching the
                  vessel. These kept aloof with a mixture of timidity and wonder; others had
                  immediately commenced hostilities, by pelting us with stones: the gentleman whom
                  we had found alone, fishing in his boat, seemed to think us entirely unworthy of
                  his notice; and some, almost without invitation, had come on board with an air of
                  perfect confidence and good-will. From the behaviour of our last visitors, I gave
                  the land from which they had put <pb n="414"/> off,* and which, as I have before
                  observed, had the appearance of an island, the name or LOOKERS-ON. </p><p n="756">At eight o'clock in the evening, a breeze sprung up at S.S.W. with which I
                  stretched off south east, because some on board thought they saw land in that
                  quarter. In this course we continued till six o'clock the next morning,* when we
                  had run eleven leagues, but saw no land, except that which we had left. Having
                  stood to the S.E. with a light breeze, which veered from the west to the north,
                  till noon, our latitude by observation was <geo select="lat">42° 56′ S</geo>. and the high land
                  that we were abreast of the preceding noon bore N. N. W. ½ W. In the afternoon we
                  had a light breeze at N. E. with which we steered west, edging in for the land,
                  which was distant about eight leagues. At seven in the evening, we were about six
                  leagues from the shore, and the southermost extremity of the land in sight bore W.
                  S. W. </p><p n="757">*At day-break on the <date>16th</date>, we discovered land bearing S. by W. and
                  seemingly detached from the coast we were upon. About eight, a breeze sprung up,
                  at N. by E. and we steered directly for it. At noon, we were in latitude <geo select="lat">43°
                     19′S</geo>. the peak on the snowy mountain bore N. 20 E. distant twenty-seven
                  leagues; the southern extremity of the land we could see bore west, and the land
                  which had been discovered in the morning appeared like an island extending from S.
                  S. W. to S. W. by W. ½ W. distant about eight leagues. In the afternoon, we stood
                  to the southward of it, with a fresh breeze at north: at eight in the evening, we
                  had run eleven leagues, and the land then extended from S. W. by W. to N. by W. We
                  were then distant about three or four leagues from the nearest shore, and in this
                  situation had fifty fathom water, with a fine sandy bottom. The variation of the
                  compass by this morning's amplitude was <geo select="lon">14° 39′ E</geo>. </p><p n="758"><pb n="415"/>At sun-rise, the next morning,* our opinion that the land we had been
                  standing for was an island, was confirmed, by our seeing part of the land of Tovy
                  Poenammoo open to the westward of it, extending as far as W. by S. At eight in the
                  morning, the extremes of the island bore N. 76 W. and N. N. E. ½ E.; and an
                  opening near the south point, which had the appearance of a bay or harbour, N. 20
                  W. distant between three and four leagues: in this situation we had thirty-eight
                  fathom water with a brown sandy bottom. </p><p n="759">This island, which I named after Mr. Banks,* lies about five leagues from
                  the coast of Tovy Poenammoo; the south point bears S. 21 W. from the highest peak
                  on the snowy mountain, and lies in latitude <geo select="lat" n="62">43° 32′ S</geo>. and in longitude
                  <geo select="lon" n="62">186° 30′ W</geo>. by an observation of the sun and moon which was made
                  this morning: it is of a circular figure, and about twenty-four leagues in
                  compass: it is sufficiently high to be seen at the distance of twelve or fifteen
                  leagues, and the land has a broken irregular surface, with the appearance rather
                  of barrenness than fertility; yet it was inhabited, for we saw smoke in one place,
                  and a few straggling natives in another. </p><p n="760">When this island was first discovered in the direction of S. by W. some
                  persons on board were of opinion that they also saw land bearing S. S. E. and S.
                  E. by E. I was myself upon the deck at the time, and told them, that in my opinion
                  it was no more than a cloud, and that as the sun rose it would dissipate and
                  vanish. However, as I was determined to leave no subject for disputation which
                  experiment could remove, I ordered the ship to be wore, and steered E. S. E. by
                  compass, in the direction which the land was said to bear from us at that time. At
                  noon we were in latitude <geo select="lat">44° 7′ S</geo>.; the south point of Banks's Island
                  bearing north, distant five <pb n="416"/> leagues.* By seven o'clock at night we
                  had run eight and twenty miles, when seeing no land, nor any signs of any, but
                  that which we had left, we bore away S. by W. and continued upon that course till
                  the next day at noon,* when we were in latitude <geo select="lat">45° 16′</geo>, the south
                  point of Banks's Island bearing N. <geo select="lon">6° 30′ W</geo>. distant twenty-eight
                  leagues. The variation by the azimuth this morning was <geo select="lon">15° 30′ E</geo>. As no
                  signs of land had yet appeared to the southward, and as I thought that we had
                  stood far enough in that direction to weather all the land we had left, judging
                  from the report of the natives in Queen Charlotte's Sound, I hauled to the
                  westward. </p><p n="761">We had a moderate breeze at N. N. W. and N. till eight in the evening,
                  when it became unsettled; and at ten fixed at south: during the night, it blew
                  with such violence that it brought us under our close reefed topsails. At eight
                  the next morning,* having run twenty-eight leagues upon a W. by N. ½ N. course,
                  and judging ourselves to be to the westward of the land of Tovy Poenammoo, we bore
                  away N. W. with a fresh gale at south. At ten, having run eleven miles upon this
                  course, we saw land extending from the S. W. to the N. W. at the distance of about
                  ten leagues, which we hauled up for. At noon, our latitude by observation was
                  <geo select="lat">44° 38′</geo>, the south east point of Bank's Island bore N. <geo select="lat">58° 30′
                     E</geo>. distant thirty leagues, and the main body of the land in sight W. by
                  N. A head sea prevented us from making much way to the southward; at seven in the
                  evening the extremes of the land stretched from S. W. by S. to N. by W.; and at
                  six leagues from the shore we had thirty-two fathom water.* At four o'clock the
                  next morning, we stood in for the shore W. by S. and during a course of four
                  leagues, our depth of water was from thirty-two to thirteen fathom. <pb n="417"/>
                  When it was thirteen fathom we were but three miles distant from the shore, and
                  therefore stood off;* its direction is here nearly N. and S. The surface, to the
                  distance of about five miles from the sea, is low and flat; but it then rises into
                  hills of a considerable height. It appeared to be totally barren, and we saw no
                  signs of its being inhabited. Our latitude, at noon, was <geo select="lat" n="63">44° 44′</geo>; and
                  the longitude which we made from Banks's Island to this place was <geo select="lon" n="63">2° 22′
                     W</geo>. During the last twenty-four hours, though we carried as much sail as
                  the ship would bear, we were driven three leagues to the leeward. </p><p n="762">We continued to stand off and on all this day and the next,* keeping at
                  the distance of between four and twelve leagues from the shore, and having water
                  from thirty-five to fifty-three fathom. On the <date>22d</date>, at noon, we had no
                  observation,* but by the land judged ourselves to be about three leagues farther
                  north than we had been the day before. At sun-set, the weather, which had been
                  hazey, clearing up, we saw a mountain which rose in a high peak, bearing N. W. by
                  N.; and at the same time, we saw the land more distinctly than before, extending
                  from N. to S. W. by S. which, at some distance within the coast, had a lofty and
                  mountainous appearance. We soon found that the accounts which had been given us by
                  the Indians in Queen Charlotte's Sound of the land to the southward were not true;
                  for they had told us that it might be circumnavigated in four days. </p><p n="763">On the <date>23d</date>,* having a hollow swell from the S. E. and expecting wind from
                  the same quarter, we kept plying between seven and fifteen leagues from the shore,
                  having from seventy to forty-four fathom. At noon, our latitude by observation was
                  <geo select="lat" n="64">44° 40′ S</geo>. and our longitude from Banks's island <geo select="lon" n="64">1° 31′
                  W</geo>. From this time to six in the evening it was <pb n="418"/> calm;* but a
                  light breeze then springing up at E.N.E. we steered S. S. E. all night, edging off
                  from the land, the hollow swell still continuing; our depth of water was from
                  sixty to seventy-five fathom. While we were becalmed, Mr. Banks, being out in the
                  boat, shot two Port Egmont hens, which were in every respect the same as those
                  that are found in great numbers upon the island of Faro, and were the first of the
                  kind we had seen upon this coast, though we fell in with some a few days before we
                  made land. </p><p n="764">*At day-break, the wind freshened, and before noon we had a strong gale at
                  N.N.E. At eight in the morning we saw the land extending as far as S. W. by S. and
                  steered directly for it. At noon, we were in latitude <geo select="lat">45° 22′ S</geo>.; and
                  the land, which now stretched from S. W. ½ S. to N.N.W. appeared to be rudely
                  diversified by hill and valley. In the afternoon, we steered S. W. by S. and S. W.
                  edging in for the land with a fresh gale at north; but though we were at no great
                  distance, the weather was so hazey that we could see nothing distinctly upon it,
                  except a ridge of high hills lying not far from the sea, and parallel to the
                  coast, which in this place stretches S. by W. and N. by E. and seemed to end in a
                  high bluff point to the southward. By eight in the evening we were abreast of this
                  point; but it being then dark, and I not knowing which way the land trended, we
                  brought to for the night. At this time, the point bore west, and was distant about
                  five miles: our depth of water was thirty-seven fathom, and the bottom consisted
                  of small pebbles. </p><p n="765">*At day-break, having made sail, the point bore north, distant three
                  leagues, and we now found that the land trended from it S. W. by W. as far as we
                  could see. This point I named CAPE SAUNDERS, in honour of Sir Charles. Our
                  latitude was <geo select="lat" n="65">45° 35′ S</geo>. and longitude <geo select="lon" n="65">189° 4′ W</geo>. By the
                  latitude, and the <pb n="419"/> angles that are made by the coast,* this point
                  will be sufficiently known; there is, however, about three or four leagues to the
                  south west of it, and very near the shore, a remarkable saddle-hill, which is a
                  good direction to it on that quarter. From one league to four leagues north of
                  Cape Saunders, the shore forms two or three bays, in which there appeared to be
                  good anchorage, and effectual shelter from the S. W. westerly, and N. westerly
                  winds; but my desire of getting to the southward, in order to ascertain whether
                  this country was an island or a continent, prevented my putting into any of them. </p><p n="766">We kept at a small distance from the shore all this morning, with the wind
                  at S. W. and had a very distinct view of it: it is of a moderate height, and the
                  surface is broken by many hills, which are green and woody; but we saw no
                  appearance of inhabitants. At noon, Cape Saunders bore N. 30 W. distant about four
                  leagues. We had variable winds and calms till five o'clock in the evening, when it
                  fixed at W. S. W. and soon blew so hard that it put us past our topsails, and
                  split the foresail all to pieces: after getting another to the yard, we continued
                  to stand to the southward under two courses; and at six the next morning, the
                  southermost land in sight bore W. by N. and Cape Saunders N. by W. distant eight
                  leagues:* at noon, it bore N. 20 W. fourteen leagues; and our latitude by
                  observation was <geo select="lat">46° 36′</geo>. The gale continued, with heavy squalls and a
                  large hollow sea all the afternoon; and at seven in the evening, we lay to under
                  our foresail, with the ship's head to the southward: at noon on the <date>27th</date>,* our
                  latitude was <geo select="lat" n="66">46° 54′</geo>, and our longitude from Cape Saunders <geo select="lon" n="66">1° 24′
                     E</geo>. At seven in the evening, we made sail under our courses;* and at eight
                  the next morning set the topsails close reefed. At noon, our latitude was <geo select="lat" n="67">47°
                     43′</geo>, and our longitude east from Cape Saunders <geo select="lon" n="67">2° 10′</geo>. At this
                  time, we wore <pb n="420"/> and stood to the northward:* in the afternoon, we
                  found the variation to be <geo select="lon">16° 34′ E</geo>. At eight in the evening, we tacked
                  and stood to the southward, with the wind at west. </p><p n="767">*At noon this day, our latitude by account was <geo select="lat" n="68">47° 52′</geo>, and our
                  longitude from Cape Saunders <geo select="lon" n="68">1° 8′ E</geo>. We stood to the southward till
                  half an hour past three in the afternoon; and then, being in latitude <geo select="lat" n="69">48°
                     S</geo>. and longitude <geo select="lon" n="69">188° W</geo>. and seeing no appearance of land, we
                  tacked and stood to the northward, having a large swell from the S. W. by W. At
                  noon the next day,* our latitude was <geo select="lat">46° 42′ S</geo>.; and Cape Saunders bore
                  N. 46 W. distant eighty-six miles. The south west swell continuing till the <date>3d</date>,*
                  confirmed our opinion, that there was no land in that quarter. At four in the
                  afternoon, we stood to the westward with all the sail we could make. In the
                  morning of the <date>4th</date>,* we found the variation to be <geo select="lon">16° 16′ E</geo>. This day
                  we saw some whales and seals, as we had done several times after our having passed
                  the streight; but we saw no seal while we were upon the coast of Eahienomauwe. We
                  sounded both in the night and this morning, but had no ground with one hundred and
                  fifty fathom. At noon, we saw Cape Saunders bearing N. ½ W.; and our latitude by
                  observation was <geo select="lat">46° 31′ S</geo>. At half an hour past one o'clock, we saw
                  land bearing W. by S. which we steered for, and before it was dark were within
                  three or four miles of it: during the whole night we saw fires upon it, and at
                  seven in the morning were within about three leagues of the shore,* which appeared
                  to be high, but level. At three o'clock in the afternoon, we saw the land
                  extending from N. E. by N. to N. W. ½ N.; and soon after we discovered some low
                  land, which appeared like an island, bearing S. ½ W. We continued our course to
                  the W. by S. and in two hours we saw high land over the low land, extending to the
                  southward as far as S. W. by S.; but it did not appear to be joined to the <pb n="421"/> land to the northward, so that there is either water,* a deep bay, or
                  low land between them. </p><p n="768">At noon on the <date>6th</date>,* we were nearly in the same situation as at noon on
                  the day before: in the afternoon we found the variation, by several azimuths and
                  the amplitude, to be <geo select="lon">15° 10′ E</geo>. On the <date>7th</date> at noon,* we were in
                  latitude <geo select="lat">47° 6′ S</geo>. and had made twelve miles easting during the last
                  twenty-four hours. We stood to the westward the remainder of this day, and all the
                  next till sun-set,* when the extreams of the land bore from N. by E. to W. distant
                  about seven or eight leagues: in this situation our depth of water was fifty-five
                  fathom, and the variation by amplitude <geo select="lon">16° 29′E</geo>. The wind now veered
                  from the N. to the W. and as we had fine weather, and moonlight, we kept standing
                  close upon the wind to the S. W. all night. At four in the morning,* we had sixty
                  fathom water; and at day-light; we discovered under our bow a ledge of rocks,
                  extending from S. by W. to W. by S. upon which the sea broke very high: they were
                  not more than three quarters of a mile distant, yet we had five and forty fathom
                  water. As the wind was at N. W. we could not now weather them, and as I was
                  unwilling to run to leeward, I tacked and made a trip to the eastward; the wind
                  however soon after coming to the northward, enabled us to get clear of all. Our
                  soundings, while we were passing within the ledge, were from thirty-five to
                  forty-seven fathom with a rocky bottom. </p><p n="769">This ledge lies S. E. six leagues from the southermost part of the land,
                  and S. E. by E. from some remarkable hills which stand near the shore: about three
                  leagues to the northward of it, there is another ledge, which lies full three
                  leagues from the shore, and on which the sea broke in a dreadful surf. As we
                  passed these rocks to the north in the <pb n="422"/> night,* and discovered the
                  others under our bow at break of day, it is manifest that our danger was imminent,
                  and our escape critical in the highest degree: from the situation of these rocks,
                  so well adapted to catch unwary strangers, I called them the TRAPS. Our latitude
                  at noon was <geo select="lat">47° 26′ S</geo>. The land in sight, which had the appearance of
                  an island, extended from N. E. by N. to N. W. by W. and seemed to be about five
                  leagues distant from the main; the eastermost ledge of rocks bore S. S. E. distant
                  one league and an half, and the northermost N. E. ½ E. distant about three
                  leagues. This land is high and barren, with nothing upon it but a few straggling
                  shrubs, for not a single tree was to be seen; it was however remarkable for a
                  number of white patches, which I took to be marble, as they reflected the sun's
                  rays very strongly: other patches of the same kind we had observed in different
                  parts of this country, particularly in Mercury Bay: we continued to stand close
                  upon a wind to the westward, and at sun-set the southermost point of land bore N.
                  38 E. distant four leagues, and the westermost land in sight bore N. 2 E. The
                  point which lies in latitude <geo select="lat" n="70">47° 19′ S</geo>. longitude <geo select="lon" n="70">192° 12′
                  W</geo>. I named SOUTH CAPE; the westermost land was a small island, lying off the
                  point of the main. </p><p n="770">Supposing South Cape to be the southern extremity of this country, as
                  indeed it proved to be, I hoped to get round it by the west, for a large hollow
                  swell from the south west, ever since our last hard gale, had convinced me that
                  there was no land in that direction. </p><p n="771">*In the night we had a hard gale at N. E. by N. and N. which brought us
                  under our courses, but about eight in the morning it became moderate; and at noon,
                  veering to the west, we tacked and stood to the northward, having no land in
                  sight. Our latitude, by observation, was <geo select="lat">47° 33′ S</geo>. our <pb n="423"/>
                  longitude, west from the South Cape, 59′.* We stood away N. N. E. close upon a
                  wind, without seeing any land, till two the next morning,* when we discovered an
                  island bearing N. W. by N. distant about five leagues: about two hours afterwards
                  we saw land a-head, upon which we tacked and stood off till six, when we stood in
                  to take a nearer view of it: at eleven we were within three leagues of it, but the
                  wind seeming to incline upon the shore, I tacked and stood off to the southward.
                  We had now sailed round the land which we had discovered on the <date>5th</date>, and which
                  then did not appear to be joined to the main which lay north of it; and being now
                  come to the other side of what we supposed to be water, a bay, or low land, it had
                  the same appearance, but when I came to lay it down upon paper I saw no reason to
                  suppose it to be an island; on the contrary, I was clearly of opinion that it made
                  part of the main. At noon, the western extremity of the main bore N. 59 W. and the
                  island which we had seen in the morning, S. 59 W. distant about five leagues. It
                  lies in latitude <geo select="lat" n="71">46° 31′ S</geo>. longitude <geo select="lon" n="71">192° 49′ W</geo>. and is
                  nothing but a barren rock about a mile in circuit, remarkably high, and lies full
                  five leagues distant from the main. This island I named after Dr. Solander, and
                  called it SOLANDER's ISLAND. The shore of the main lies nearest E. by S. and W. by
                  N. and forms a large open bay, in which there is no appearance of any harbour or
                  shelter for shipping against S. W. and southerly winds: the surface of the country
                  is broken into craggy hills, of a great height, on the summits of which are
                  several patches of snow: it is not, however, wholly barren, for we could see wood
                  not only in the vallies, but upon the highest ground, yet we saw no appearance of
                  its being inhabited. </p><p n="772">We continued to stand to the S. W. by S. till eleven o'clock the next
                  morning,* when the wind shifted to the S. W. by W. <pb n="424"/> upon which we
                  wore,* and stood to the N. N. W. being then in latitude <geo select="lat" n="72">47° 40′ S</geo>.
                  longitude <geo select="lon" n="72">193° 50′ W</geo>. and having a hollow sea from the S. W. </p><p n="773">*During the night, we steered N. N. W. till six in the morning, when,
                  seeing no land, we steered N. by E. till eight, when we steered N. E. by E. ½ E.
                  to make the land, which at ten we saw bearing E. N. E. but it being hazy, we could
                  distinguish nothing upon it. At noon, our latitude, by observation, was <geo select="lat">46°
                     S</geo>. About two it cleared up, and the land appeared to be high, rude, and
                  mountainous: about half an hour after three I hauled in for a bay, in which there
                  appeared to be good anchorage; but in about an hour, finding the distance too
                  great to run before it would be dark, and the wind blowing too hard to make the
                  attempt safe in the night, I bore away along the shore. </p><p n="774">This bay, which I called DUSKY BAY, lies in latitude <geo select="lat">45° 47′
                  S</geo>.: it is between three and four miles broad at the entrance, and seems to
                  be full as deep as it is broad: it contains several islands, behind which there
                  must be shelter from all winds, though possibly there may not be sufficient depth
                  of water. The north point of this bay, when it bears S. E. by S. is rendered very
                  remarkable by five high peaked rocks which lie off it, and have the appearance of
                  the four fingers and thumb of a man's hand, for which reason I called it POINT
                  FIVE FINGERS: the land of this Point is farther remarkable, for being the only
                  level land within a considerable distance. It extends near two leagues to the
                  northward, is lofty, and covered with wood: the land behind it is very different,
                  consisting wholly of mountains, totally barren and rocky; and this difference
                  gives the Cape the appearance of an island. </p><p n="775"><pb n="425"/>At sun-set, the southermost land in sight bore due south,* distant
                  about five or six leagues; and as this is the westermost point of land upon the
                  whole coast, I called it WEST CAPE. It lies about three leagues to the southward
                  of Dusky Bay, in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="73">45° 54′ S</geo>. and in the longitude of
                  <geo select="lon" n="73">193° 17′ W</geo>. The land of this Cape is of a moderate height next the
                  sea, and has nothing remarkable about it, except a very white cliff, two or three
                  leagues to the southward of it: to the southward of it also the land trends away
                  to the S. E. and to the northward it trends N. N. E. </p><p n="776">Having brought to for the night,* we made sail along the shore at four in
                  the morning, in the direction of N. E. ½ N. with a moderate breeze at S. S. E. At
                  noon, our latitude, by observation, was <geo select="lat">45° 13′ S</geo>. At this time, being
                  about a league and an half from the shore, we sounded, but had no ground with
                  seventy fathom: we had just passed a small narrow opening in land, where there
                  seemed to be a very safe and convenient harbour, formed by an island, which lay in
                  the middle of the opening at east. The opening lies in latitude <geo select="lat">45° 16′
                     S</geo>. and on the land behind it are mountains, the summits of which were
                  covered with snow, that appeared to have been recently fallen; and indeed for two
                  days past we had found the weather very cold. On each side the entrance of the
                  opening, the land rises almost perpendicularly from the sea to a stupendous
                  height, and this indeed was the reason why I did not carry the ship into it, for
                  no wind could blow there but right in, or right out, in the direction of either
                  east or west, and I thought it by no means advisable to put into a place whence I
                  could not have got out but with a wind which experience had taught me did not blow
                  more than one day in a month. In this, however, I acted contrary to the opinion of
                  some persons on board, who in very <pb n="426"/> strong terms expressed their
                  desire to harbour for present convenience,* without any regard to future
                  disadvantages. </p><p n="777">In the evening, being about two leagues from the shore, we sounded, and
                  had no ground with 108 fathom: the variation of the needle, by azimuth, was
                     <geo select="lon">14° E</geo>. and by amplitude <geo select="lon">15° 2′</geo>. We made the best of our
                  way along the shore with what wind we had, keeping at the distance of between two
                  and three leagues. At noon, we were in latitude <geo select="lat">44° 47′</geo>, having run
                  only twelve leagues upon a N.E. ¼ N. course, during the last four and twenty
                  hours. </p><p n="778">We continued to steer along the shore, in the direction of N.E. ¼ E. till
                  six o'clock in the evening, when we brought to for the night.* At four in the
                  morning, we stood in for the land, and when the day broke we saw what appeared to
                  be an inlet; but upon a nearer approach proved to be only a deep valley between
                  two high lands: we proceeded therefore in the same course, keeping the shore at
                  the distance of between four and five miles.* At noon on the <date>16th</date>, the northermost
                  point of land in sight bore N. 60 E. at the distance of ten miles; and our
                  latitude, by observation, was <geo select="lat" n="74">44° 5′</geo>, our longitude from Cape West
                  <geo select="lon" n="74">2° 8′ E</geo>. About two, we past the point which at noon had been distant
                  ten miles, and found it to consist of high red cliffs, down which there fell a
                  cascade of water in four small streams, and I therefore gave it the name of
                  CASCADE POINT. From this Point the land trends first N. 76 E. and afterwards more
                  to the northward. At the distance of eight leagues from Cascade Point, in the
                  direction of E.N.E. and at a little distance from the shore, lies a small low
                  island, which bore from us S. by E. at the distance of about a league and a half. </p><p n="779"><pb n="427"/>At seven in the evening, we brought to,* in thirty-three fathom with
                  a fine sandy bottom, at ten we had fifty fathom, and at twelve wore in sixty-five
                  fathom, having driven several miles N.N.W. after our having brought to.* At two in
                  the morning, we had no ground with 140 fathom, by which it appears that the
                  soundings extend but a little way from the shore. About this time it fell calm; at
                  eight, a breeze sprung up at S.W. with which we steered along the shore, in the
                  direction of N.E. by E. ½ E. at the distance of about three leagues. At six in the
                  evening, being about one league from the shore, we had seventeen fathom; and at
                  eight, being about three leagues from the shore, we had forty-four: we now
                  shortened sail and brought to, having run ten leagues N.E. by E. since noon. </p><p n="780">It was calm most part of the night;* but at ten in the morning a light
                  breeze sprung up at S.W. by W. when we made sail again along the shore, N.E. by N.
                  having a large swell from the W.S.W. which had risen in the night; at noon, our
                  latitude, by observation, was <geo select="lat" n="75">43° 4′ S</geo>. and our longitude from Cape
                  West <geo select="lon" n="75">4° 12′ E</geo>. We observed, that the vallies as well as the mountains
                  were this morning covered with snow, part of which we supposed to have fallen
                  during the night, when we had rain. At six in the evening we shortened sail, and
                  at ten brought to, at the distance of about five leagues from the shore, where we
                  had 115 fathom. At midnight, there being little wind, we made sail,* and at eight
                  in the morning we stood to the N.E. close upon a wind till noon, when we tacked,
                  being about three leagues from the land, and, by observation, in latitude <geo select="lat" n="76">42°
                     8′</geo>, and longitude from Cape West <geo select="lon" n="76">5° 5′ E</geo>. </p><p n="781">We continued to stand westward till two in the morning,* when we made a
                  trip to the eastward, and afterwards stood westward till noon, when, by our
                  reckoning, we were in <pb n="428"/> the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="77">42° 23′</geo>,* and
                  longitude from Cape West <geo select="lon" n="77">3° 55′ E</geo>. We now tacked and stood eastward,
                  with a fresh gale at N. by W. till six in the evening, when the wind shifted to
                  the S. and S.S.W. with which we steered N.E. by N. till six in the morning,* when
                  we hauled in E. by N. to make the land, which we saw soon afterwards; at noon, our
                  latitude, by account, was <geo select="lat" n="78">41° 37′</geo>, and our longitude from Cape West
                  <geo select="lon" n="78">5° 42′ E</geo>. We were now within three or four leagues of the land, but
                  it being foggy, we could see nothing upon it distinctly, and as we had much wind,
                  and a vast swell rolling in upon the shore, from the W.S.W. I did not think it
                  safe to go nearer. </p><p n="782">In the afternoon, we had a gentle breeze from the S.S.W. with which we
                  steered north along the shore till eight, when, being within between two and three
                  leagues, we sounded, and had but thirty-four fathom; upon which we hauled off N.W.
                  by N. till eleven at night, and then brought to, having sixty-four fathom.* At
                  four in the morning, we made sail to the N.E. with a light breeze at S.S.W. which
                  at eight veered to the westward, and soon after died away: at this time we were
                  within three or four miles of the land, and had fifty-four fathom, with a large
                  swell from the W.S.W. rolling obliquely upon the shore, which made me fear that I
                  should be obliged to anchor; but by the help of a light air now and then from the
                  S.W. I was able to keep the ship from driving. At noon, the northermost land in
                  sight bore N.E. by E. ½ E. distant about ten leagues; our latitude, by account,
                  was <geo select="lat" n="79">40° 55′ S</geo>. longitude from Cape West <geo select="lon" n="79">6° 35′ E</geo>. From this
                  time we had light airs from the southward, with intervals of calm,* till noon on
                  the <date>23d</date>, when our latitude, by observation, was <geo select="lat" n="80">40° 36′ 30″ S.</geo> and our
                  longitude from Cape West <geo select="lon" n="80">6° 52′ E</geo>. The eastermost point of land in
                  sight bore E. 10 N. at the distance of seven leagues, and a bluff <pb n="429"/>
                  head or point, of which we had been abreast at noon the day before, and off which
                  lay some rocks above water,* bore S. 18 W. at the distance of six leagues. This
                  point I called ROCK's POINT. Our latitude was now <geo select="lat">40° 55′ S</geo>. and having
                  nearly run down the whole of the north west coast of Tovy Poenammoo, I shall give
                  some account of the face of the country. </p><p n="783">I have already observed, that on the <date>11th</date>, when we were off the southern
                  part, the land then seen was craggy and mountainous, and there is great reason to
                  believe that the same ridge of mountains extends nearly the whole length of the
                  island. Between the westermost land which we saw that day, and the eastermost
                  which we saw on the <date>13th</date>, there is a space of about six or eight leagues, of which
                  we did not see the coast, though we plainly discovered the mountains inland. The
                  sea coast near Cape West is low, rising with an easy and gradual ascent to the
                  foot of the mountains, and being in most parts covered with wood. From Point Five
                  Fingers, down to latitude <geo select="lat">44° 20′</geo> there is a narrow ridge of hills that
                  rises directly from the sea, and is covered with wood: close behind these hills
                  are the mountains, extending in another ridge of a stupendous height, and
                  consisting of rocks that are totally barren and naked, except where they are
                  covered with snow, which is to be seen in large patches upon many parts of them,
                  and has probably lain there ever since the creation of the world: a prospect more
                  rude, craggy, and desolate than this country affords from the sea, cannot possibly
                  be conceived, for as far inland as the eye can reach, nothing appears but the
                  summits of rocks, which stand so near together, that instead of vallies there is
                  only fissures between them. From the latitude of <geo select="lat">44° 20′</geo>, to the
                  latitude of <geo select="lat">42° 8′</geo>, these mountains lie farther inland, and <pb n="430"/> the sea coast consists of woody hills and vallies,* of various height and
                  extent, and has much appearance of fertility: many of the vallies form plains of
                  considerable extent, wholly covered with wood, but it is very probable that the
                  ground, in many places, is swampy and interspersed with pools of water. From
                  latitude <geo select="lat">42° 8′</geo>, to <geo select="lat">41° 30′</geo>, the land is not distinguished
                  by any thing remarkable: it rises into hills directly from the sea, and is covered
                  with wood; but the weather being foggy while we were upon this part of the coast,
                  we could see very little inland, except now and then the summits of the mountains,
                  towering above the cloudy mists that obscured them below, which confirmed my
                  opinion that a chain of mountains extended from one end of the island to the
                  other. </p><p n="784">In the afternoon, we had a gentle breeze at S.W. which, before it was
                  quite dark, brought us abreast of the eastern point which we had seen at noon; but
                  not knowing what course the land took on the other side of it, we brought to in
                  thirty-four fathom, at the distance of about one league from the shore. At eight
                  in the evening, there being little wind, we filled and stood on till midnight, and
                  then we brought to till four in the morning,* when we again made sail, and at
                  break of day we saw low land extending from the point to the S.S.E. as far as the
                  eye could reach, the eastern extremity of which appeared in round hillocks: by
                  this time the gale had veered to the eastward, which obliged us to ply to
                  windward.* At noon next day, the eastern point bore S.W. by S. distant sixteen
                  miles, and our latitude was <geo select="lat">40° 19′</geo>: the wind continuing easterly, we
                  were nearly in the same situation at noon on the day following.* About three
                  o'clock the wind came to the westward, and we steered E.S.E. with all the sail we
                  could set till it was dark, and then shortened sail till the morning:* as we had
                  thick hazey weather all night, <pb n="431"/> we kept sounding continually,* and
                  had from thirty-seven to forty-two fathom. When the day broke we saw land bearing
                  S.E. by E. and an island lying near it, bearing E.S.E. distant about five leagues:
                  this island I knew to be the same that I had seen from the entrance of Queen
                  Charlotte's Sound, from which it bears N.W. by N. distant nine leagues. At noon,
                  it bore south, distant four or five miles, and the north west head of the Sound
                  S.E. by S. distant ten leagues and an half. Our latitude, by observation, was
                  <geo select="lat">40° 33′ S</geo>. </p><p n="785">As we had now circumnavigated the whole country, it became necessary to
                  think of quitting it, but as I had thirty tons of empty water casks on board, this
                  could not be done till I had filled them: I therefore hauled round the island, and
                  entered a bay, which lies between that and Queen Charlotte's Sound, leaving three
                  more islands, which lay close under the western shore, between three or four miles
                  within the entrance, on our starboard hand: while we were running in, we kept the
                  lead continually going, and had from forty to twelve fathom. At six o'clock in the
                  evening, we anchored in eleven fathom with a muddy bottom, under the west shore,
                  in the second cove, that lies within the three islands; and as soon as it was
                  light the next morning,* I took a boat, and went on shore to look for a
                  watering-place, and a proper birth for the ship, both which I found, much to my
                  satisfaction. As soon as the ship was moored, I sent an officer on shore to
                  superintend the watering, and the carpenter, with his crew, to cut wood, while the
                  long-boat was employed in landing the empty casks. </p><p n="786">In this employment we were busy till the <date>30th</date>,* when the wind seeming to
                  settle at S.E. and our water being nearly completed, we warped the ship out of the
                  cove, that we might have room to get under sail: and at noon I went away <pb n="432"/> in the pinnace to examine as much of the bay as my time would admit.* </p><p n="787">After rowing about two leagues up it, I went ashore upon a point of land
                  on the western side, and having climbed a hill, I saw the western arm of this bay
                  run in S.W. by W. about five leagues farther, yet I could not discover the end of
                  it: there appeared to be several other inlets, or at least small bays, between
                  this and the north west head of Queen Charlotte's Sound, in each of which, I make
                  no doubt, there is anchorage and shelter, as they are all covered from the sea
                  wind by the islands which lie without them. The land about this bay, as far as I
                  could see of it, is of a hilly surface, chiefly covered with trees, shrubs, and
                  fern, which render travelling difficult and fatiguing. In this excursion I was
                  accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, who found several new plants. We met
                  with some hutts, which seemed to have been long deserted, but saw no inhabitants.
                  Mr. Banks examined several of the stones that lay upon the beach, which were full
                  of veins, and had a mineral appearance; but he did not discover any thing in them
                  which he knew to be ore: if he had had an opportunity to examine any of the bare
                  rocks, perhaps he might have been more fortunate. He was also of opinion that what
                  I had taken for marble in another place, was a mineral substance; and that,
                  considering the correspondence of latitude between this place and South America,
                  it was not improbable but that, by a proper examination, something very valuable
                  might be found. </p><p n="788">At my return in the evening, I found all the wood and water on board, and
                  the ship ready for the sea; I resolved therefore to quit the country, and return
                  home by such a route as might be of most advantage to the service; and <pb n="433"/> upon this subject took the opinion of my officers.* I had myself a strong
                  desire to return by Cape Horn, because that would have enabled me finally to
                  determine, whether there is or is not a southern continent; but against this it
                  was a sufficient objection that we must have kept in a high southern latitude in
                  the very depth of winter, with a vessel which was not thought sufficient for the
                  undertaking: and the same reason was urged against our proceeding directly for the
                  Cape of Good Hope, with still more force, because no discovery of moment could be
                  hoped for in that rout; it was therefore resolved that we should return by the
                  East Indies, and that with this view we should, upon leaving the coast, steer
                  westward, till we should fall in with the east coast of New Holland, and then
                  follow the direction of that coast to the northward, till we should arrive at its
                  northern extremity; but if that should be found impracticable, it was further
                  resolved that we should endeavour to fall in with the land, or islands, said to
                  have been discovered by Quiros. </p><p n="789">With this view,* at break of day on Saturday the <date>31st of March</date> 1770, we
                  got under sail, and put to sea, with the advantage of a fresh gale at S. E. and
                  clear weather, taking our departure from the eastern point, which we had seen at
                  noon on the <date>23d</date>, and to which, on this occasion, I gave the name of CAPE FAREWELL. </p><p n="790">The bay out of which we had just sailed I called ADMIRALTY BAY, giving the
                  name of CAPE STEPHENS to the north west point, and of CAPE JACKSON to the south
                  east, after the two gentlemen who at this time were Secretaries to the Board. </p><p n="791">Admiralty Bay may easily be known by the island that has been just
                  mentioned, which lies two miles N. E. of Cape Stephens, in latitude <geo select="lat" n="81">40° 37′
                     S</geo>. longitude <geo select="lon" n="81">185° 6′ W</geo>. and is of a considerable height.
                  Between this island and Cape Farewell, <pb n="434"/> which are between fourteen
                  and fifteen leagues distant from each other,* in the direction of W. by N. and E.
                  by S. the shore forms a large deep bay, the bottom of which we could scarcely see
                  while we were sailing in a strait line from one Cape to the other; it is, however,
                  probably of less depth than it appeared to be, for as we found the water shallower
                  here, than at the same distance from any other part of the coast, there is reason
                  to suppose, that the land at the bottom which lies next the sea is low, and
                  therefore not easily to be distinguished from it. I have for this reason called it
                  BLIND BAY, and am of opinion that it is the same which was called Murderer's Bay
                  by Tasman. </p><p n="792">Such particulars of this country and its inhabitants, with their manners
                  and customs, as could be learnt while we were circumnavigating the coast, shall
                  now be related. </p></div><pb n="435"/><div type="chapter" n="28"><head><l>CHAP.VIII.</l><l><emph rend="italic"> A general Account of New Zealand: its first Discovery,
                        Situation, Extent, Climate, and Productions.</emph></l></head><p n="793">NEW ZEALAND was first discovered by Abel Jansen Tasman, a Dutch
                  navigator,* whose name has been several times mentioned in this narrative, on the
                  <date>13th of December</date>, in the year 1642. He traversed the eastern coast from latitude
                  <geo select="lat">34° to 43</geo>, and entered the streight which divides the two islands,
                  and in the chart is called COOK's STREIGHT; but being attacked by the natives soon
                  after he came to an anchor, in the place to which he gave the name of Murderer's
                  Bay, he never went on shore. He gave the country the name of STAATEN LAND, or the
                  land of the States, in honour of the States-General, and it is now generally
                  distinguished in our maps and charts by the name of NEW ZEALAND. As the whole of
                  this country, except that part of the coast which was seen by Tasman from on board
                  his ship, has from his time, to the voyage of the Endeavour, remained altogether
                  unknown, it has by many been supposed to be part of a southern continent. It is
                  however now known to consist of two large islands, divided from each other by a
                  streight or passage, which is about four or five leagues broad. </p><p n="794">These islands are situated between the latitudes of <geo select="lat" n="82">34°</geo> and
                  <geo select="lat" n="83">48° S</geo>. and between the longitudes of <geo select="lon" n="82">181°</geo> and <geo select="lon" n="83">194°
                     W</geo>. which is now determined with uncommon exactness, from innumerable
                  observations of the sun and moon, and one of the <pb n="436"/> transits of
                  Mercury,* by Mr. Green, a person of known abilities, who, as has been observed
                  before, was sent out by the Royal Society, to observe the transit of Venus in the
                  South Seas. </p><p n="795">The northermost of these islands is called by the natives Eaheinomauwe,
                  and the southermost Tovy, or Tavai Poenammoo; yet, as I have observed before, we
                  are not sure whether the name Tovy Poenammoo comprehends the whole southern
                  island, or only part of it. The figure and extent of these islands, with the
                  situation of the bays and harbours they contain, and the smaller islands that lie
                  about them, will appear from the chart that I have drawn, every part of which,
                  however, I cannot vouch to be equally accurate. The coast of Eaheinomauwe, from
                  Cape Palliser to East Cape, is laid down with great exactness, both in its figure,
                  and the course and distance from point to point; for the opportunities that
                  offered, and the methods that I used, were such as could scarcely admit of an
                  error. From East Cape to St. Maria van Diemen, the chart, though perhaps not
                  equally exact, is without any error of moment, except possibly in some few places
                  which are here, and in other parts of the chart, distinguished by a dotted line,
                  and which I had no opportunity to examine: from Cape Maria van Diemen to latitude
                  <geo select="lat">36° 15′</geo>, we were seldom nearer the shore than between five and eight
                  leagues; and therefore the line that marks the sea coast may possibly be
                  erroneous. From latitude <geo select="lat">36° 15′</geo> to nearly the length of Entry Island,
                  our course was very near the shore, and in this part of the chart therefore there
                  can be no material error, except perhaps at Cape Tierawitte. Between Entry Island
                  and Cape Palliser we were again farther from the shore, and this part of the coast
                  therefore may not be laid down with minute exactness; yet, upon the whole, I am of
                  opinion that this island will be <pb n="437"/> found not much to differ from the
                  figure that I have given it,* and that upon the coast there are few or no harbours
                  which are not noticed in the journal, or delineated in the chart. I cannot however
                  say as much of Tovy Poenammoo, the season of the year, and the circumstances of
                  the voyage, would not permit me to spend so much time about this island as I had
                  employed upon the other; and the storms that we met with made it both difficult
                  and dangerous to keep near the shore. However, from Queen Charlotte's Sound to
                  Cape Campbel, and as far to the S.W. as latitude <geo select="lat">43°</geo>, the chart will be
                  found pretty accurate. Between latitude <geo select="lat">43°</geo> and latitude <geo select="lat">44°
                     20′</geo> the line may be doubted, for of some part of the coast which it
                  represents, we had scarcely a view. From latitude <geo select="lat">44° 20′</geo>, to Cape
                  Saunders, our distance would not permit me to be particular, and the weather was
                  besides extremely unfavourable. From Cape Saunders to Cape South, and even to Cape
                  West, there is also reason to fear that the chart will in many places be found
                  erroneous, as we were seldom able to keep the shore, and were sometimes blown to
                  such a distance that it could not be seen. From Cape West to Cape Farewell, and
                  even to Charlotte's Sound, it is not more to be trusted. </p><p n="796">Tovy Poenammoo is for the most part a mountainous,* and to all appearance
                  a barren country; and the people whom we saw in Queen Charlotte's Sound, those
                  that came off to us under the snowy mountains, and the fires to the west of Cape
                  Saunders, were all the inhabitants, and signs of inhabitants, that we discovered
                  upon the whole island. </p><p n="797">Eaheinomauwe has a much better appearance; it is indeed not only hilly but
                  mountainous, yet even the hills and mountains are covered with wood, and every
                  valley has a rivulet <pb n="438"/> of water:* the soil in these vallies, and in
                  the plains, of which there are many that are not overgrown with wood, is in
                  general light but fertile, and in the opinion of Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, as
                  well as of every other gentleman on board, every kind of European grain, plants,
                  and fruit, would flourish here in the utmost luxuriance: from the vegetables that
                  we found here, there is reason to conclude, that the winters are milder than those
                  in England, and we found the summer not hotter, though it was more equally warm;
                  so that if this country should be settled by people from Europe, they would, with
                  a little industry, be very soon supplied not only with the necessaries, but the
                  luxuries of life in great abundance. </p><p n="798">*In this country there are no quadrupeds but dogs and rats, at least we
                  saw no other, and the rats are so scarce that many of us never saw them. The dogs
                  live with the people, who breed them for no other purpose than to eat: there might
                  indeed be quadrupeds that we did not see, but this is not probable, because the
                  chief pride of the natives, with respect to their dress, is in the skins and hair
                  of such animals as they have, and we never saw the skin of any animal about them
                  but those of dogs and birds: there are indeed seals upon the coast, and we once
                  saw a sea lion, but we imagine they are seldom caught, for though we saw some of
                  their teeth which were fashioned into an ornament like a bodkin, and worn by the
                  natives at their breast, and highly valued, we saw none of their skins: there are
                  whales also upon this coast, and though the people did not appear to have any art
                  or instrument by which such an animal could be taken and killed, we saw
                  pattoo-pattoos in the possession of some of them, which were made of the bone of a
                  whale, or of some other animal whose bone had exactly the same appearance. </p><p n="799"><pb n="439"/>Of birds the species are not many; and of these none,* except perhaps
                  the gannet, is the same with those of Europe: here are ducks indeed, and shags of
                  several kinds, sufficiently resembling those of Europe, to be called the same, by
                  those who have not examined them very nicely. Here are also hawks, owls, and
                  quails, which differ but little from those of Europe at first sight; and several
                  small birds, whose song, as has been remarked in the course of the narrative, is
                  much more melodious than any that we had ever heard. </p><p n="800">The sea coast is also visited by many oceanic birds, particularly
                  albatrosses, sheerwaters, pintados, and a few of the birds which Sir John
                  Narborough has called Penguins, and which indeed are what the French call Nuance,
                  and seem to be a middle species between bird and fish; for their feathers,
                  especially those upon their wings, differ very little from scales; and their wings
                  themselves, which they use only in diving, and not to accelerate their motion even
                  upon the surface of the water, may, perhaps with equal propriety, be called fins. </p><p n="801">Neither are insects in greater plenty than birds: a few butterflies and
                  beetles, flesh flies, very like those in Europe, and some musquitos and sand
                  flies, perhaps exactly the same with those of North America, make up the whole
                  catalogue. Of musquitos and sand flies, however, which are justly accounted the
                  curse of every country where they abound, we did not see many; there were indeed a
                  few in almost every place where we went on shore, but they gave us so little
                  trouble, that we did not make use of the shades which we had provided for the
                  security of our faces. </p><p n="802">For this scarcity of animals upon the land, the sea, however, makes an
                  abundant recompense; every creek swarming <pb n="440"/> with fish,* which are not
                  only wholesome, but equally delicious with those of Europe: the ship seldom
                  anchored in any station, or with a light gale passed any place, that did not
                  afford us enough with hook and line to serve the whole ship's company, especially
                  to the southward: when we lay at anchor, the boats, with hook and line, near the
                  rocks, could take fish in any quantity; and the seine seldom failed of producing a
                  still more ample supply; so that both times when we anchored in Cook's Streight,
                  every mess in the ship, that was not careless and improvident, salted as much as
                  lasted many weeks after they went to sea. Of this article, the variety was equal
                  to the plenty; we had mackrel of many kinds, among which, one was exactly the same
                  as we have in England: these came in immense shoals, and were taken by the natives
                  in their seines, who sold them to us at a very easy rate. Besides these, there
                  were fish of many species which we had never seen before, but to all which the
                  seamen very readily gave names; so that we talked here as familiarly of hakes,
                  bream, cole-fish, and many others, as we do in England; and though they are by no
                  means of the same family, at must be confessed that they do honour to the name.
                  But the highest luxury which the sea afforded us, even in this place, was the
                  lobster or sea cray-fish, which are probably the same that in the Account of Lord
                  Anson's Voyage are said to have been found at the island of Juan Fernandes, except
                  that, although large, they are not quite equal in size: they differ from ours in
                  England in several particulars, they have a greater number of prickles on their
                  backs, and they are red when first taken out of the water. These we also bought
                  every where to the northward in great quantities of the natives, who catch them by
                  diving near the shore, and finding out where they lie with their feet. We had also
                  a fish that Frezier, in his Voyage to the Spanish Main in South America, <pb n="441"/> has described by the names of Elefant, Pejegallo,* or Poison coq,
                  which though coarse, we eat very heartily. Several species of the skate, or
                  sting-ray, are also found here, which were still coarser than the Elefant; but as
                  an atonement, we had among many kinds of dog-fish one, spotted with white, which
                  was in flavour exactly similar to our best skate, but much more delicious. We had
                  also flat fish resembling both soles and flounders, besides eels and congers of
                  various kinds, with many others of which those who shall hereafter visit this
                  coast will not fail to find the advantage; and shell-fish in great variety,
                  particularly clams, cockles, and oysters. </p><p n="803">Among the vegetable productions of this country,* the trees claim a
                  principal place; for here are forests of vast extent, full of the straitest, the
                  cleanest, and the largest timber trees that we had ever seen; their size, their
                  grain, and apparent durability, render them fit for any kind of building, and
                  indeed for every other purpose except masts; for which, as I have already
                  observed, they are too hard, and too heavy: there is one in particular which, when
                  we were upon the coast, was rendered conspicuous by a scarlet flower, that seemed
                  to be a compendage of many fibres; it is about as large as an oak, and the wood is
                  exceedingly hard and heavy, and excellently adapted to the use of the mill-wright.
                  There is another which grows in the swamps, remarkably tall and strait, thick
                  enough to make masts for vessels of any size, and, if a judgment may be formed by
                  the direction of its grain, very tough: this, which, as has been before remarked,
                  our carpenter thought to resemble the pitch-pine, may probably be lightened by
                  tapping, and it will then make the finest masts in the world: it has a leaf not
                  unlike a yew, and bears berries in small bunches. </p><p n="804"><pb n="442"/>*Great part of the country is covered with a luxuriant verdure, and
                  our natural historians were gratified by the novelty, if not the variety of the
                  plants. Sow-thistle, garden night-shade, one or two kinds of grass, the same as in
                  England, and two or three kinds of fern, like those of the West Indies, with a few
                  of the plants that are to be found in almost every part of the world, were all,
                  out of about four hundred species, that have hitherto been described by any
                  botanists, or had been seen elsewhere during the course of this voyage, except
                  about five or six which had been gathered at Terra del Fuego. </p><p n="805">Of eatable vegetables there are but few; our people, indeed, who had been
                  long at sea, eat, with equal pleasure and advantage, of wild celery, and a kind of
                  cresses, which grew in great abundance upon all parts of the sea-shore. We also,
                  once or twice, met with a plant like what the country people in England call
                  Lamb's quarters, or Fat-hen, which we boiled instead of greens; and once we had
                  the good fortune to find a cabbage tree, which afforded us a delicious meal; and,
                  except the fern-root, and one other vegetable, totally unknown in Europe, and
                  which, though eaten by the natives, was extremely disagreeable to us, we found no
                  other vegetable production that was fit for food, among those that appeared to be
                  the wild produce of the country; and we could find but three esculent plants among
                  those which are raised by cultivation, yams, sweet potatoes, and coccos. Of the
                  yams and potatoes there are plantations consisting of many acres, and I believe
                  that any ship which should happen to be here in the autumn, when they are dug up,
                  might purchase them in any quantity. </p><p n="806">Gourds are also cultivated by the natives of this place, the fruit of
                  which furnishes them with vessels for various uses. <pb n="443"/> We also found
                  here the Chinese paper mulberry tree,* the same as that of which the inhabitants
                  of the South Sea islands make their cloth; but it is so scarce, that though the
                  New Zealanders also make cloth of it, they have not enough for any other purpose
                  than to wear as an ornament in the holes which they make in their ears, as I have
                  observed before. </p><p n="807">But among all the trees, shrubs, and plants of this country, there is not
                  one that produces fruit, except a berry which has neither sweetness nor flavour,
                  and which none but the boys took pains to gather, should be honoured with that
                  appellation. There is, however, a plant that serves the inhabitants instead of
                  hemp and flax, which excels all that are put to the same purposes in other
                  countries. Of this plant there are two sorts; the leaves of both resemble those of
                  flags, but the flowers are smaller, and their clusters more numerous; in one kind
                  they are yellow, and in the other a deep red. Of the leaves of these plants, with
                  very little preparation, they make all their common apparel; and of these they
                  make also their strings, lines, and cordage for every purpose, which are so much
                  stronger than any thing we can make with hemp, that they will not bear a
                  comparison. From the same plant, by another preparation, they draw long slender
                  fibres which shine like silk, and are as white as snow: of these, which are also
                  surprisingly strong, the finer clothes are made; and of the leaves, without any
                  other preparation than splitting them into proper breadths, and tying the strips
                  together, they make their fishing nets; some of which, as I have before remarked,
                  are of an enormous size. </p><p n="808">A plant, which with such advantage might be applied to so many useful and
                  important purposes, would certainly be <pb n="444"/> a great acquisition to
                  England,* where it would probably thrive with very little trouble, as it seems to
                  be hardy, and to affect no particular soil; being found equally in hill and
                  valley; in the driest mould, and the deepest bogs: the bog, however, it seems
                  rather to prefer, as near such places we observed it to be larger than elsewhere. </p><p n="809">I have already observed, that we found great plenty of iron sand in
                  Mercury Bay, and therefore that iron ore is undoubtedly to be found at no great
                  distance. As to other metals we had scarcely knowlege enough of the country for
                  conjecture. </p><p n="810">If the settling of this country should ever be thought an object worthy
                  the attention of Great Britain, the best place for establishing a colony would be
                  either on the banks of the Thames, or in the country bordering upon the Bay of
                  Islands. In either place there would be the advantage of an excellent harbour;
                  and, by means of the river, settlements might be extended, and a communication
                  established with the inland parts of the country: vessels might be built of the
                  fine timber which abounds in these parts, at very little trouble and expence, fit
                  for such a navigation as would answer the purpose. I cannot indeed exactly assign
                  the depth of water which a vessel intended to navigate this river, even as far up
                  as I went with the boat, should draw, because this depends upon the depth of water
                  that is upon the bar, or flats, which lie before the narrow part of the river, for
                  I had no opportunity to make myself acquainted with them; but I am of opinion,
                  that a vessel which should draw not more than twelve feet would perfectly answer
                  the purpose. </p><p n="811">*When we first arrived upon the coast of this country, we imagined it to
                  be much better peopled than we afterwards <pb n="445"/> found it,* concluding that
                  the inland parts were populous from the smoke that we saw at a considerable
                  distance from the shore; and perhaps that may really be the case with respect to
                  the country behind Poverty Bay, and the Bay of Plenty, where the inhabitants
                  appeared to be more numerous than in other places. But we had reason to believe,
                  that, in general, no part of the country but the sea coast is inhabited; and even
                  there we found the people but thinly scattered, all the western coast from Cape
                  Maria Van Diemen to Mount Egmont being totally desolate; so that upon the whole
                  the number of inhabitants bears no proportion to the extent of country. </p></div><pb n="446"/><div type="chapter" n="29"><head><l>CHAP.IX.</l><l><emph rend="italic"> A Description of the Inhabitants, their Habitations,
                        Apparel, Ornaments, Food, Cookery, and Manner of Life.</emph></l></head><p n="812">*THE stature of the men in general is equal to the largest of those in
                  Europe: they are stout, well limbed, and fleshy; but not fat, like the lazy and
                  luxurious inhabitants of the islands in the South Seas: they are also exceedingly
                  vigorous and active; and have an adroitness, and manual dexterity in an uncommon
                  degree, which are discovered in whatever they do. I have seen the strokes of
                  fifteen paddles on a side in one of their canoes made with incredible quickness,
                  and yet with such minute exactness of time, that all the rowers seemed to be
                  actuated by one common soul. Their colour in general is brown; but in few deeper
                  than that of a Spaniard, who has been exposed to the sun; in many not so deep. The
                  women have not a feminine delicacy in their appearance, but their voice is
                  remarkably soft; and by that, the dress of both sexes being the same, they are
                  principally distinguished: they have, however, like the women of other countries,
                  more airy cheerfulness, and a greater flow of animal spirits, than the other sex.
                  Their hair, both of the head and beard, is black; and their teeth extremely
                  regular, and as white as ivory: the features of both sexes are good; they seem to
                  enjoy high health, and we saw many who appeared to be of a great age. The
                  dispositions both of the men and women seemed to be mild and gentle; they treat
                     <pb n="447"/> each other with the tenderest affection,* but are implacable
                  towards their enemies, to whom, as I have before observed, they never give
                  quarter. It may perhaps, at first, seem strange, that where there is so little to
                  be got by victory, there should so often be war; and that every little district of
                  a country inhabited by people so mild and placid, should be at enmity with all the
                  rest. But possibly more is to be gained by victory among these people than at
                  first appears, and they may be prompted to mutual hostilities by motives which no
                  degree of friendship or affection is able to resist. It appears, by the account
                  that has already been given of them, that their principal food is fish, which can
                  only be procured upon the sea-coast; and there, in sufficient quantities, only at
                  certain times: the tribes, therefore, who live inland, if any such there are, and
                  even those upon the coast, must be frequently in danger of perishing by famine.
                  Their country produces neither sheep, nor goats, nor hogs, nor cattle; tame fowls
                  they have none, nor any art by which those that are wild can be caught in
                  sufficient plenty to serve as provision. If there are any whose situation cuts
                  them off from a supply of fish, the only succedaneum of all other animal food,
                  except dogs, they have nothing to support life, but the vegetables that have
                  already been mentioned, of which the chief are fern root, yams, clams, and
                  potatoes: when by any accident these fail, the distress must be dreadful; and even
                  among the inhabitants of the coast, many tribes must frequently be reduced to
                  nearly the same situation, either by the failure of their plantations, or the
                  deficiency of their dry stock, during the season when but few fish are to be
                  caught. These considerations will enable us to account, not only for the perpetual
                  danger in which the people who inhabit this country appear to live, by the care
                  which they take to fortify every village, but for the horrid practice of eating
                  those who are killed in <pb n="448"/> battle;* for the hunger of him who is
                  pressed by famine to fight, will absorb every feeling, and every sentiment which
                  would restrain him from allaying it with the body of his adversary. It may however
                  be remarked, that, if this account of the origin of so horrid a practice is true,
                  the mischief does by no means end with the necessity that produced it: after the
                  practice has been once begun on one side by hunger, it will naturally be adopted
                  on the other by revenge. Nor is this all, for though it may be pretended, by some
                  who wish to appear speculative and philosophical, that whether the dead body of an
                  enemy be eaten or buried, is in itself a a matter perfectly indifferent; as it is,
                  whether the breasts and thighs of a woman should be covered or naked; and that
                  prejudice and habit only make us shudder at the violation of custom in one
                  instance, and blush at it in the other: yet, leaving this as a point of doubtful
                  disputation, to be discussed at leisure, it may safely be affirmed, that the
                  practice of eating human flesh, whatever it may be in itself, is relatively, and
                  in its consequences, most pernicious; tending manifestly to eradicate a principle
                  which is the chief security of human life, and more frequently restrains the hand
                  of murder than the sense of duty, or even the fear of punishment. </p><p n="813">Among those who are accustomed to eat the dead, death must have lost much
                  of its horror; and where there is little horror at the sight of death, there will
                  not be much repugnance to kill. A sense of duty, and fear of punishment, may be
                  more easily surmounted than the feelings of Nature, or those which have been
                  engrafted upon Nature by early prejudice and uninterrupted custom. The horror of
                  the murderer arises less from the guilt of the fact, than its natural effect; and
                  he who has familiarised the effect, will consequently lose much of the horror. By
                  our laws, and our religion, <pb n="449"/> murder and theft incur the same
                  punishment,* both in this world and the next; yet, of the multitude who would
                  deliberately steal, there are but very few who would deliberately kill, even to
                  procure much greater advantage. But there is the strongest reason to believe, that
                  those who have been so accustomed to prepare a human body for a meal, that they
                  can with as little feeling cut up a dead man, as our cook-maids divide a dead
                  rabbit for a fricassee, would feel as little horror in committing a murder as in
                  picking a pocket, and consequently would take away life with as little compunction
                  as property; so that men, under these circumstances, would be made murderers by
                  the slight temptations that now make them thieves. If any man doubts whether this
                  reasoning is conclusive, let him ask himself, whether in his own opinion he should
                  not be safer with a man in whom the horror of destroying life is strong, whether
                  in consequence of natural instinct unsubdued, or of early prejudice, which has
                  nearly an equal influence; than in the power of a man who under any temptation to
                  murder him would be restrained only by considerations of interest; for to these
                  all motives of mere duty may be reduced, as they must terminate either in hope of
                  good, or fear of evil. </p><p n="814">The situation and circumstances, however, of these poor people, as well as
                  their temper, are favourable to those who shall settle as a colony among them.
                  Their situation sets them in need of protection, and their temper renders it easy
                  to attach them by kindness; and whatever may be said in favour of a savage life,
                  among people who live in luxurious idleness upon the bounty of Nature,
                  civilization would certainly be a blessing to those whom her parsimony scarcely
                  furnishes with the bread of life, and who are perpetually destroying each other by
                  violence, as the only alternative of perishing by hunger. </p><p n="815"><pb n="450"/>*But these people, from whatever cause, being inured to war, and by
                  habit considering every stranger as an enemy, were always disposed to attack us
                  when they were not intimidated by our manifest superiority. At first, they had no
                  notion of any superiority but numbers; and when this was on their side, they
                  considered all our expressions of kindness as the artifices of fear and cunning,
                  to circumvent them, and preserve ourselves: but when they were once convinced of
                  our power, after having provoked us to the use of our fire-arms, though loaded
                  only with small shot; and of our clemency, by our forbearing to make use of
                  weapons so dreadful except in our defence; they became at once friendly, and even
                  affectionate, placing in us the most unbounded confidence, and doing every thing
                  which could incite us to put equal confidence in them. It is also remarkable, that
                  when an intercourse was once established between us, they were very rarely
                  detected in any act of dishonesty. Before, indeed, and while they considered us as
                  enemies, who came upon their coast only to make an advantage of them, they did not
                  scruple by any means to make an advantage of us; and would, therefore, when they
                  had received the price of any thing they had offered to sell, pack up both the
                  purchase and the purchase-money with all possible composure, as so much lawful
                  plunder from people who had no view but to plunder them. </p><p n="816">I have observed that our friends in the South Seas had not even the idea
                  of indecency, with respect to any object or any action; but this was by no means
                  the case with the inhabitants of New Zealand, in whose carriage and conversation
                  there was as much modest reserve and decorum with respect to actions, which yet in
                  their opinion were not criminal, as are to be found among the politest people in
                  Europe. The women were not impregnable; but the terms and manner <pb n="451"/> of
                  compliance were as decent as those in marriage among us,* and according to their
                  notions, the agreement was as innocent. When any of our people made an overture to
                  one of their young women, he was given to understand that the consent of her
                  friends was necessary, and by the influence of a proper present, it was generally
                  obtained; but when these preliminaries were settled, it was also necessary to
                  treat the wife for a night, with the same delicacy that is here required by the
                  wife for life, and the lover who presumed to take any liberties by which this was
                  violated, was sure to be disappointed. </p><p n="817">One of our gentlemen having made his addresses to a family of the better
                  sort, received an answer, which, translated into our language, according to the
                  mode and spirit of it, as well as the letter, would have been exactly in these
                  terms: "Any of these young ladies will think themselves honoured by your
                  addresses, but you must first make me a suitable present, and you must then come
                  and sleep with us on shore, for daylight must by no means be a witness of what
                  passes between you." </p><p n="818">I have already observed, that in personal cleanliness they are not quite
                  equal to our friends at Otaheite; because, not having the advantage of so warm a
                  climate, they do not so often go into the water; but the most disgustful thing
                  about them is the oil, with which, like the Islanders, they anoint their hair: it
                  is certainly the fat either of fish or of birds, melted down, and though the
                  better sort have it fresh, their inferiors use that which is rancid, and
                  consequently are almost as disagreeable to the smell as a Hottentot; neither are
                  their heads free from vermin, though we observed that they were furnished with
                  combs, both of bone and wood: these combs are sometimes worn stuck upright in the
                  hair as an <pb n="452"/> ornament,* a fashion which at present prevails among the
                  ladies of England. The men generally wear their beards short, and their hair tied
                  upon the crown of the head in a bunch, in which they stick the feathers of various
                  birds, in different manners, according to their fancies; sometimes one is placed
                  on each side of the temples, pointing forwards, which we thought made a very
                  disagreeable appearance. The women wear their hair sometimes cropped short, and
                  sometimes flowing over their shoulders. </p><p n="819">The bodies of both sexes are marked with the black stains called Amoco, by
                  the same method that is used at Otaheite, and called Tattowing; but the men are
                  more marked, and the women less. The women in general stain no part of their
                  bodies but the lips, though sometimes they are marked with small black patches on
                  other parts: the men, on the contrary, seem to add something every year to the
                  ornaments of the last, so that some of them, who appeared to be of an advanced
                  age, were almost covered from head to foot. Besides the Amoco, they have marks
                  impressed by a method unknown to us, of a very extraordinary kind: they are
                  furrows of about a line deep, and a line broad, such as appear upon the bark of a
                  tree which has been cut through, after a year's growth: the edges of these furrows
                  are afterwards indented by the same method, and being perfectly black, they make a
                  most frightful appearance. The faces of the old men are almost covered with these
                  marks; those who are very young, black only their lips like the women; when they
                  are somewhat older, they have generally a black patch upon one cheek, and over one
                  eye, and so proceed gradually, that they may grow old and honourable together: but
                  though we could not but be disgusted with the horrid deformity which these stains
                  and furrows produced in the "human face divine," we could not but admire the
                  dexterity <!--Page  [unnumbered]--></p><p n="820">[illustration] <pb n="453"/> and art with which they were impressed.* The
                  marks upon the face in general are spirals, which are drawn with great nicety, and
                  even elegance, those on one side exactly corresponding with those on the other:
                  the marks on the body somewhat resemble the foliage in old chased ornaments, and
                  the convolutions of fillagree work; but in these they have such a luxuriance of
                  fancy, that of an hundred, which at first sight appeared to be exactly the same,
                  no two were, upon a close examination, found to be alike. We observed, that the
                  quantity and form of these marks were different in different parts of the coast,
                  and that as the principal seat of them at Otaheite was the breech, in New Zealand
                  it was sometimes the only part which was free, and in general was less
                  distinguished than any other. The skins of these people, however, are not only
                  dyed, but painted, for as I have before observed, they smear their bodies with red
                  oker, some rubbing it on dry, and some applying it in large patches mixed with
                  oil, which is always wet, and which the least touch will rub off, so that the
                  transgressions of such of our people as were guilty of ravishing a kiss from these
                  blooming beauties, were most legibly written upon their faces. </p><p n="821">The dress of a New Zealander is certainly, to a stranger at first sight,
                  the most uncouth that can be imagined. It is made of the leaves of the flag, which
                  has been described among the vegetable productions of this country: these leaves
                  are split into three or four slips, and the slips, when they are dry, interwoven
                  with each other into a kind of stuff between netting and cloth, with all the ends,
                  which are eight or nine inches long, hanging out on the upper side, like the shag
                  or thrumb matts, which we sometimes see lying in a passage. Of this cloth, if
                  cloth it may be called, <pb n="454"/> two pieces serve for a complete dress;* one
                  of them is tied over their shoulders with a string, and reaches as low as the
                  knees; to the end of this string is fastened a bodkin of bone, which is easily
                  passed through any two parts of this upper garment, so as to tack them together;
                  the other piece is wrapped round the waist, and reaches nearly to the ground: the
                  lower garment, however, is worn by the men only upon particular occasions; but
                  they wear a belt, to which a string is fastened, for a very singular use. The
                  inhabitants of the South Sea islands slit up the prepuce so as to prevent it from
                  covering the glans of the penis, but these people, on the contrary, bring the
                  prepuce over the glans, and to prevent it from being drawn back by the contraction
                  of the part, they tie the string which hangs from their girdle, round the end of
                  it. The glans indeed seemed to be the only part of their body which they were
                  solicitous to conceal, for they frequently threw off all their dress but the belt
                  and string, with the most careless indifference, but shewed manifest signs of
                  confusion, when, to gratify our curiosity, they were requested to untie the
                  string, and never consented but with the utmost reluctance and shame. When they
                  have only their upper garment on, and sit upon their hams, they bear some
                  resemblance to a thatched house; but this covering, though it is ugly, is well
                  adapted to the use of those who frequently sleep in the open air, without any
                  other shelter from the rain. </p><p n="822">But besides this course shag or thatch, they have two sorts of cloth,
                  which have an even surface, and are very ingeniously made, in the same manner with
                  that manufactured by the inhabitants of South America, some of which we procured
                  at Rio de Janeiro. One sort is as coarse as our coarsest canvas, and somewhat
                  resembles it in the manner of laying the threads, but it is ten times as strong:
                  the other is <pb n="455"/> formed by many threads lying very close one way,* and a
                  few crossing them the other, so as to bind them together; but these are about half
                  an inch asunder, somewhat like the round pieces of cane matting which are
                  sometimes placed under the dishes upon a table. This is frequently striped, and
                  always had a pretty appearance, for it is composed of the fibres of the same
                  plant, which are prepared so as to shine like silk. It is made in a kind of frame
                  of the size of the cloth, generally about five feet long, and four broad, across
                  which the long threads, which lie close together, or warp, are strained, and the
                  cross threads, or woof, are worked in by hand, which must be a very tedious
                  operation. </p><p n="823">To both these kinds of cloth they work borders of different colours, in
                  stitches, somewhat like carpeting, or rather like those used in the samplars which
                  girls work at school. These borders are of various patterns, and wrought with a
                  neatness, and even an elegance, which, considering they have no needle, is
                  surprizing: but the great pride of their dress consists in the fur of their dogs,
                  which they use with such oeconomy that they cut it into stripes, and sew them upon
                  their cloth at a distance from each other, which is a strong proof that dogs are
                  not plenty among them; these stripes are also of different colours, and disposed
                  so as to produce a pleasing effect. We saw some dresses that were adorned with
                  feathers instead of fur, but these were not common; and we saw one that was
                  intirely covered with the red feathers of the parrot. </p><p n="824">The dress of the man who was killed, when we first went ashore in Poverty
                  Bay, has been described already; but we saw the same dress only once more during
                  our stay upon the coast, and that was in Queen Charlotte's Sound. </p><p n="825"><pb n="456"/>*The women, contrary to the custom of the sex in general, seemed to
                  affect dress rather less than the men: their hair, which, as I have observed
                  before, is generally cropt short, is never tied upon the top of the head when it
                  is suffered to be long, nor is it ever adorned with feathers. Their garments were
                  made of the same materials, and in the same form, as those of the other sex, but
                  the lower one was always bound fast round them, except when they went into the
                  water to catch lobsters, and then they took great care not to be seen by the men.
                  Some of us happening one day to land upon a small island in Tolaga Bay, we
                  surprized several of them at this employment; and the chaste Diana, with her
                  nymphs, could not have discovered more confusion and distress at the sight of
                  Actaeon, than these women expressed upon our approach. Some of them hid themselves
                  among the rocks, and the rest crouched down in the sea till they had made
                  themselves a girdle and apron of such weeds as they could find, and when they came
                  out, even with this veil, we could perceive that their modesty suffered much pain
                  by our presence. The girdle and apron which they wear in common, have been
                  mentioned before. </p><p n="826">Both sexes bore their ears, and by stretching them the holes become large
                  enough to admit a finger at least. In these holes they wear ornaments of various
                  kinds, cloth, feathers, bones of large birds, and even sometimes a stick of wood;
                  and to these receptacles of finery they generally applied the nails which we gave
                  them, and every thing which it was possible they could contain. The women
                  sometimes thrust through them the down of the albatross, which is as white as
                  snow, and which, spreading before and behind the hole in a bunch almost as big as
                  the fist, makes a very singular, and however strange it may be thought, not a
                  disagreeable <pb n="457"/> appearance.* Besides the ornaments that are thrust
                  through the holes of the ears, many others are suspended to them by strings; such
                  as chissels or bodkins made of green talc, upon which they set a high value, the
                  nails and teeth of their deceased relations, the teeth of dogs, and every thing
                  else that they can get, which they think either curious or valuable. The women
                  also wear bracelets and anclets, made of the bones of birds, shells, or any other
                  substances which they can perforate and string upon a thread. The men had
                  sometimes hanging to a string, which went round the neck, a piece of green talc,
                  or whalebone, somewhat in the shape of a tongue, with the rude figure of a man
                  carved upon it; and upon this ornament they set a high value. In one instance, we
                  saw the gristle that divides the nostrils, and called by anatomists, the septum
                  nasi, perforated, and a feather thrust through the whole, which projected on each
                  side over the cheeks: it is probable that this frightful singularity was intended
                  as an ornament, but of the many people we saw, we never observed it in any other,
                  nor even a perforation that might occasionally serve for such a purpose. </p><p n="827">Their houses are the most inartificially made of any thing among them,
                  being scarcely equal, except in size,* to an English dog-kennel: they are seldom
                  more than eighteen or twenty feet long, eight or ten broad, and five or six high,
                  from the pole that runs from one end to the other, and forms the ridge, to the
                  ground: the framing is of wood, generally slender sticks, and both walls and roof
                  consist of dry grass and hay, which, it must be confessed, is very tightly put
                  together; and some are also lined with the bark of trees, so that in cold weather
                  they must afford a very comfortable retreat. The roof is sloping, like those of
                  our barns, and the door is at one end, just high enough to admit a man, creeping
                  upon his hands and knees: near the door is a square <pb n="458"/> hole,* which
                  serves the double office of window and chimney, for the fire-place is at that end,
                  nearly in the middle between the two sides: in some conspicuous part, and
                  generally near the door, a plank is fixed, covered with carving after their
                  manner: this they value as we do a picture, and in their estimation it is not an
                  inferior ornament: the sidewalls and roof project about two feet beyond the walls
                  at each end, so as to form a kind of porch, in which there are benches for the
                  accommodation of the family. That part of the floor which is allotted for the
                  fire-place, is enclosed in a hollow square, by partitions either of wood or stone,
                  and in the middle of it the fire is kindled. The floor, along the inside of the
                  walls, is thickly covered with straw, and upon this the family sleep. </p><p n="828">*Their furniture and implements consist of but few articles, and one chest
                  commonly contains them all, except their provision-baskets, the gourds that hold
                  their fresh water, and the hammers that are used to beat their fern-root, which
                  generally stand without the door: some rude tools, their cloaths, arms, and a few
                  feathers to stick in their hair, make the rest of their treasure. </p><p n="829">Some of the better sort, whose families are large, have three or four
                  houses enclosed within a court-yard, the walls of which are constructed of poles
                  and hay, and are about ten or twelve feet high. </p><p n="830">When we were on shore in the district called Tolaga, we saw the ruins, or
                  rather the frame of a house, for it had never been finished, much superior in size
                  to any that we saw elsewhere: it was thirty feet in length, about fifteen in
                  breadth, and twelve high: the sides of it were adorned with many carved planks, of
                  a workmanship much superior to any other that we had met with in the country; but
                  for <pb n="459"/> what purpose it was built, or why it was deserted,* we could
                  never learn. </p><p n="831">But these people, though in their houses they are so well defended from
                  the inclemency of the weather, seem to be quite indifferent whether they have any
                  shelter at all during their excursions in search of fern roots and fish, sometimes
                  setting up a small shade to windward, and sometimes altogether neglecting even
                  that precaution, sleeping with their women and children under bushes, with their
                  weapons ranged round them, in the manner that has already been described. The
                  party consisting of forty or fifty, whom we saw at Mercury Bay, in a district
                  which the natives call Opoorage, never erected the least shelter while we staid
                  there, though it sometimes rained incessantly for four and twenty hours together. </p><p n="832">The articles of their food have been enumerated already;* the principal,
                  which to them is what bread is to the inhabitants of Europe, is the roots of the
                  fern which grows upon the hills, and is nearly the same with what grows upon our
                  high commons in England, and is called indifferently fern, bracken, or brakes. The
                  birds which sometimes serve them for a feast, are chiefly penguins and
                  albatrosses, with a few other species that have been occasionally mentioned in
                  this narrative. </p><p n="833">Having no vessel in which water can be boiled,* their cookery consists
                  wholly of baking and roasting. They bake nearly in the same manner as the
                  inhabitants of the South Seas, and to the account that has been already given of
                  their roasting, nothing need be added, but that the long skewer or spit to which
                  the flesh is fastened, is placed stoping towards the sire, by setting one stone
                  against the bottom of it, and supporting it near the middle with another, by the
                  moving <pb n="460"/> of which to a greater or less distance from the end,* the
                  degree of obliquity is increased or diminished at pleasure. </p><p n="834">To the northward, as I have observed, there are plantations of yams, sweet
                  potatoes, and coccos, but we saw no such to the southward; the inhabitants
                  therefore of that part of the country must subsist wholly upon fern root and fish,
                  except the scanty and accidental resource which they may find in sea fowl and
                  dogs; and that fern and fish are not to be procured at all seasons of the year,
                  even at the sea side, and upon the neighbouring hills, is manifest from the stores
                  of both that we saw laid up dry, and the reluctance which some of them expressed
                  at selling any part of them to us when we offered to purchase them, at least the
                  fish, for sea stores: and this particular seems to confirm my opinion that this
                  country scarcely sustains the present number of its inhabitants, who are urged to
                  perpetual hostilities by hunger, which naturally prompted them to eat the dead
                  bodies of those who were slain in the contest. </p><p n="835">Water is their universal and only liquor, as far as we could discover, and
                  if they have really no means of intoxication, they are, in this particular, happy
                  beyond any other people that we have yet seen or heard of. </p><p n="836">As there is perhaps no source of disease either critical or chronic, but
                  intemperance and inactivity, it cannot be thought strange that these people enjoy
                  perfect and uninterrupted health: in all our visits to their towns, where young
                  and old, men and women, crowded about us, prompted by the same curiosity that
                  carried us to look at them, we never saw a single person who appeared to have any
                  bodily complaint, nor among the numbers that we have seen naked, did we once
                  perceive the slightest eruption upon the skin, or any marks that an eruption had
                  left behind: at first, indeed, <pb n="461"/> observing that some of them when they
                  came off to us were marked in patches with a white flowery appearance upon
                  different parts of their bodies,* we thought that they were leperous, or highly
                  scorbutic; but upon examination we found that these marks were owing to their
                  having been wetted by the sprey of the sea in their passage, which, when it was
                  dried away, left the salts behind it in a fine white powder. </p><p n="837">Another proof of health, which we have mentioned upon a former occasion,
                  is the facility with which the wounds healed that had left scars behind them, and
                  that we saw in a recent state; when we saw the man who had been shot with a musket
                  ball through the fleshy part of his arm, his wound seemed to be so well digested,
                  and in so fair a way of being perfectly healed, that if I had not known no
                  application had been made to it, I should certainly have enquired, with a very
                  interested curiosity, after the vulnerary herbs and surgical art of the country. </p><p n="838">A farther proof that human nature is here untainted with disease, is the
                  great number of old men that we saw, many of whom, by the loss of their hair and
                  teeth, appeared to be very ancient, yet none of them were decrepit, and though not
                  equal to the young in muscular strength, were not a whit behind them in
                  cheerfulness and vivacity. </p></div><pb n="462"/><div type="chapter" n="30"><head><l>CHAP.X.</l><l><emph rend="italic"> Of the Canoes and Navigation of the Inhabitants of New

                        Language: With some Reasons against the Existence of a Southern
                        Continent.</emph></l></head><p n="839">*THE ingenuity of these people appears in nothing more than in their
                  canoes: they are long and narrow, and in shape very much resemble a New England
                  whale boat: the larger sort seem to be built chiefly for war, and will carry from
                  forty to eighty, or an hundred armed men. We measured one which lay ashore at
                  Tolaga: she was sixty-eight feet and an half long, five feet broad, and three feet
                  and an half deep; the bottom was sharp, with strait sides like a wedge, and
                  consisted of three lengths, hollowed out to about two inches, or an inch and an
                  half thick, and well fastened together with strong plaiting: each side consisted
                  of one intire plank, sixty-three feet long, ten or twelve inches broad, and about
                  an inch and quarter thick, and these were fitted and lashed to the bottom part
                  with great dexterity and strength. A considerable number of thwarts were laid from
                  gunwale to gunwale, to which they were securely lashed on each side, as a
                  strengthening to the boat. The ornament at the head projected five or six feet
                  beyond the body, and was about four feet and an half high; the ornament at the
                  stern was fixed upon that end, as the sternpost of a ship is upon her keel, and
                  was about fourteen feet high, two feet broad, and an inch and an half thick. They
                  <!--Page  [unnumbered]--></p><p n="840">[illustration] <!--Page  [unnumbered]--> [illustration] <pb n="463"/> both
                  consisted of boards of carved work,* of which the design was much better than the
                  execution. All their canoes, except a few at Opoorage or Mercury Bay, which were
                  of one piece, and hollowed by fire, are built after this plan, and few are less
                  than twenty feet long: some of the smaller sort have outriggers, and sometimes two
                  of them are joined together, but this is not common. The carving upon the stern
                  and head ornaments of the inferior boats, which seem to be intended wholly for
                  fishing, consists of the figure of a man, with a face as ugly as can be conceived,
                  and a monstrous tongue thrust out of the mouth, with the white shells of sea-ears
                  stuck in for the eyes. But the canoes of the superior kind, which seem to be their
                  men of war, are magnificently adorned with open work, and covered with loose
                  fringes of black feathers, which had a most elegant appearance: the gunwale boards
                  were also frequently carved in a grotesque taste, and adorned with tufts of white
                  feathers placed upon a black ground. Of visible objects that are wholly new, no
                  verbal description can convey a just idea, but in proportion as they resemble some
                  that are already known, to which the mind of the reader must be referred: the
                  carving of these people being of a singular kind, and not in the likeness of any
                  thing that is known on our side of the ocean, either in the heaven above, or in
                  the earth beneath, or in the waters that are under the earth, I must refer wholly
                  to the representations which will be found of it in Plate XV. The paddles are
                  small, light, and neatly made; the blade is of an oval shape, or rather of a shape
                  resembling a large leaf, pointed at the bottom, broadest in the middle, and
                  gradually losing itself in the shaft, the whole length being about six feet, of
                  which the shaft or loom including the handle is <pb n="464"/> four;* and the blade
                  two. By the help of these oars they push on their boats with amazing velocity. </p><p n="841">In sailing they are not expert, having no art of going otherwise than
                  before the wind: the sail is of netting or matt, which is set up between two poles
                  that are fixed upright upon each gunwale, and serve both for masts and yards: two
                  ropes answered the purpose of sheets, and were consequently fastened above to the
                  top of each pole. But clumsy and inconvenient as this apparatus is, they make good
                  way before the wind, and are steered by two men who sit in the stern, with each a
                  paddle in his hand for that purpose. </p><p n="842">*Having said thus much of their workmanship, I shall now give some account
                  of their tools; they have adzes, axes, and chissels, which serve them also as
                  augers for the boring of holes: as they have no metal, their adzes and axes are
                  made of a hard black stone, or of a green talc, which is not only hard but tough;
                  and their chissels of human bone, or small fragments of jaspar, which they chip
                  off from a block in sharp angular pieces like a gun-flint. Their axes they value
                  above all that they possess, and never would part with one of them for any thing
                  that we could give: I once offered one of the best axes I had in the ship, besides
                  a number of other things for one of them, but the owner would not sell it; from
                  which I conclude that good ones are scarce among them. Their small tools of
                  jaspar, which are used in finishing their nicest work, they use till they are
                  blunt, and then, as they have no means of sharpening them, throw them away. We had
                  given the people at Tolaga a piece of glass, and in a short time they found means
                  to drill a hole through it, in order to hang it round the neck as an ornament by a
                  thread; and we imagine the tool must have been a piece of this jaspar. How they
                  bring their large tools first to an <pb n="465"/> edge, and sharpen the weapon
                  which they call Patoo-Patoo,* we could not certainly learn; but probably it is by
                  bruising the same substance to powder, and, with this, grinding two pieces against
                  each other. </p><p n="843">Their nets, particularly their seine,* which is of an enormous size, have
                  been mentioned already: one of these seems to be the joint work of a whole town,
                  and I suppose it to be the joint property also: the other net, which is circular,
                  and extended by two or three hoops, has been particularly described as well as the
                  manner of baiting and using it. Their hooks are of bone or shell, and in general
                  are ill made. To receive the fish when it is caught, and to hold their other
                  provisions, they have baskets of various kinds and dimensions, very neatly made of
                  wicker work. </p><p n="844">They excel in tillage,* as might naturally be expected where the person
                  that sows is to eat the produce, and where there is so little besides that can be
                  eaten: when we first came to TEGADOO, a district between Poverty Bay and East
                  Cape, their crops were just covered, and had not yet begun to sprout; the mould
                  was as smooth as in a garden, and every root had its small hillock, ranged in a
                  regular quincunx by lines, which with the pegs were still remaining in the field.
                  We had not an opportunity to see any of these husbandmen work, but we saw what
                  serves them at once for spade and plough: this instrument is nothing more than a
                  long narrow stake sharpened to an edge at one end, with a short piece fastened
                  transversely at a little distance above it, for the convenience of pressing it
                  down with the foot. With this they turn up pieces of ground six or seven acres in
                  extent, though it is not more than three inches broad; but as the soil is light
                  and sandy it makes little resistance. </p><p n="845"><pb n="466"/>*Tillage, weaving, and the other arts of peace, seem to be best known
                  and most practised in the northern part of this country; for there is little
                  appearance of any of them in the South: but the arts of war flourish equally
                  through the whole coast. </p><p n="846">*Of weapons they have no great variety, but such as they have are well
                  fitted for destruction; they have spears, darts, battle-axes, and the Patoo-Patoo.
                  The spear is fourteen or fifteen feet long, pointed at both ends, and sometimes
                  headed with bone: these are grasped by the middle, so that the part behind
                  balancing that before, makes a push more difficult to be parried, than that of a
                  weapon which is held by the end. The dart and other weapons have been sufficiently
                  described already; and it has also been remarked, that these people have neither
                  sling nor bow. They throw the dart by hand, and so they do stones; but darts and
                  stones are seldom used except in defending their forts. Their battles, whether in
                  boats or on shore, are generally hand to hand, and the slaughter must consequently
                  be great, as a second blow with any of their weapons is unnecessary, if the first
                  takes place: their trust, however, seems to be principally placed in the
                  Patoo-Patoo, which is fastened to their wrists by a strong strap, lest it should
                  be wrenched from them, and which the principal people generally wear sticking in
                  their girdles, considering it as a military ornament, and part of their dress,
                  like the poinard of the Asiatic, and the sword of the European. They have no
                  defensive armour; but, besides their weapons, the Chiefs carried a staff of
                  distinction, in the same manner as our officers do the spontoon: this was
                  generally the rib of a whale, as white as snow, with many ornaments of carved
                  work, dog's hair, and feathers; but sometimes it was a stick, about six feet long,
                  adorned in <!--Page  [unnumbered]--></p><p n="847">[illustration] <pb n="467"/> the same manner, and inlaid with a shell like
                  mother-of-pearl.* Those who bore this mark of distinction were generally old, at
                  least past the middle age, and were also more marked with the Amoco than the rest.
                  One or more persons, thus distinguished, always appeared in each canoe, when they
                  came to attack us, according to the size of it. When they came within about a
                  cable's length of the ship, they used to stop, and the Chiefs rising from their
                  seat, put on a dress which seemed appropriated to the occasion, generally of dog's
                  skin, and holding out their decorated staff, or a weapon, directed the rest of the
                  people what they should do. When they were at too great a distance to reach us
                  with a lance or a stone, they presumed that we had no weapon with which we could
                  reach them; here then the defiance was given, and the words were almost
                  universally the same, Haromai, haromai, harre uta a Patoo-Patoo oge: </p><p n="848">Come to us, come on shore, and we will kill you all with our Patoo-Patoos.
                  While they were uttering these menaces they came gradually nearer and nearer, till
                  they were close alongside; talking at intervals in a peaceable strain, and
                  answering any questions that we asked them; and at intervals renewing their
                  defiance and threats, till being encouraged by our apparent timidity, they began
                  their war-song and dance, as a prelude to an attack, which always followed, and
                  was sometimes continued till it became absolutely necessary to repress them by
                  firing some small-shot; and sometimes ended after throwing a few stones on board,
                  as if content with having offered us an insult which we did not dare to revenge.
                  The war-dance consists of a great variety of violent motions, and hideous
                  contortions of the limbs, during which the countenance also performs its part: the
                  tongue is frequently <pb n="468"/> thrust out to an incredible length,* and the
                  eye-lids so forcibly drawn up that the white appears both above and below, as well
                  as on each side of the iris, so as to form a circle round it; nor is any thing
                  neglected that can render the human shape frightful and deformed: at the same time
                  they brandish their spears, shake their darts, and cleave the air with their
                  Patoo-Patoos. This horrid dance is always accompanied by a song; it is wild
                  indeed, but not disagreeable, and every strain ends in a loud and deep sigh, which
                  they utter in concert. In the motions of the dance, however horrid, there is a
                  strength, firmness, and agility, which we could not but behold with admiration;
                  and in their song they keep time with such exactness, that I have often heard
                  above an hundred paddles struck against the sides of their boats at once, so as to
                  produce but a single sound, at the divisions of their music. </p><p n="849">A song not altogether unlike this, they sometimes sing without the dance,
                  and as a peaceable amusement: they have also other songs which are sung by the
                  women, whose voices are remarkably mellow and soft, and have a pleasing and tender
                  effect; the time is slow, and the cadence mournful; but it is conducted with more
                  taste than could be expected among the poor ignorant savages of this half desolate
                  country; especially as it appeared to us, who were none of us much acquainted with
                  music as a science, to be sung in parts; it was at least sung by many voices at
                  the same time. </p><p n="850">They have sonorous instruments, but they can scarcely be called
                  instruments of music; one is the shell, called the Triton's trumpet, with which
                  they make a noise not unlike that which our boys sometimes make with a cow's horn:
                  the other is a small wooden pipe, resembling a child's nine-pin, only much
                  smaller, and in this there is no more music than <pb n="469"/> in a pea-whistle.*
                  They seem sensible indeed that these instruments are not musical; for we never
                  heard an attempt to sing to them, or to produce with them any measured tones that
                  bore the least resemblance to a tune. </p><p n="851">To what has been already said of the practice of eating human flesh, I
                  shall only add, that in almost every cove where we landed, we found flesh bones of
                  men near the places where fires had been made; and that among the heads that were
                  brought on board by the old man, some seemed to have false eyes, and ornaments in
                  their ears as if alive. That which Mr. Banks bought was sold with great reluctance
                  by the possessor: the head was manifestly that of a young person about fourteen or
                  fifteen years of age, and by the contusions on one side appeared to have received
                  many violent blows, and indeed a part of the bone near the eye was wanting. These
                  appearances confirmed us in the opinion that the natives of this country give no
                  quarter, nor take any prisoners to be killed and eaten at a future time, as is
                  said to have been a practice among the Indians of Florida: for if prisoners had
                  been taken, this poor young creature, who cannot be supposed capable of making
                  much resistance, would probably have been one, and we knew that he was killed with
                  the rest, for the fray had happened but a few days before. </p><p n="852">The towns or Hippahs of these people, which are all fortified, have been
                  sufficiently described already, and from the Bay of Plenty to Queen Charlotte's
                  Sound they seem to be the constant residence of the people: but about Poverty Bay,
                  Hawk's Bay, Tegadoo, and Tolaga, we saw no Hippahs, but single houses scattered at
                  a distance from each other; yet upon the sides of the hills there were stages of a
                  great length, furnished with stones and darts, probably as retreats for the <pb n="470"/> people at the last extremity,* as upon these stages a fight may be
                  carried on with much advantage against those below, who may be reached with great
                  effect by darts and stones, which it is impossible for them to throw up with equal
                  force. And indeed the forts themselves seem to be no farther serviceable than by
                  enabling the possessors to repress a sudden attack; for as there is no supply of
                  water within the lines, it would be impossible to sustain a siege. A considerable
                  stock of fern-root and dry fish is indeed laid up in them; but they may be
                  reserved against seasons of scarcity, and that such seasons there are, our
                  observations left us no room to doubt; besides, while an enemy should be prowling
                  in the neighbourhood, it would be easy to snatch a supply of water from the side
                  of the hill, though it would be impossible to dig up fern root or catch fish. </p><p n="853">In this district, however, the people seemed to live in a state of
                  conscious security, and to avail themselves of their advantage: their plantations
                  were more numerous, their canoes were more decorated, and they had not only finer
                  carving, but finer clothes. This part of the coast also was much the most
                  populous, and possibly their apparent peace and plenty might arise from their
                  being united under one Chief, or King; for the inhabitants of all this part of the
                  country told us, that they were the subjects of Teratu: when they pointed to the
                  residence of this Prince, it was in a direction which we thought inland; but
                  which, when we knew the country better, we found to be the Bay of Plenty. </p><p n="854">*It is much to be regretted that we were obliged to leave this country
                  without knowing any thing of Teratu but his name. As an Indian monarch, his
                  territory is certainly extensive: he was acknowledged from Cape Kidnappers to the
                  northward, and westward as far as the Bay of Plenty, a length <pb n="471"/> of
                  coast upwards of eighty leagues;* and we do not yet know how much farther westward
                  his dominions may extend. Possibly the fortified towns which we saw in the Bay of
                  Plenty may be his barrier; especially as at Mercury Bay he was not acknowledged,
                  nor indeed any other single Chief: for wherever we landed, or spoke with the
                  people upon that coast, they told us that we were at but a small distance from
                  their enemies. </p><p n="855">In the dominions of Teratu we saw several subordinate Chiefs, to whom
                  great respect was paid, and by whom justice was probably administered; for upon
                  our complaint to one of them, of a theft that had been committed on board the ship
                  by a man that came with him, he gave him several blows and kicks, which the other
                  received as the chastisement of authority, against which no resistance was to be
                  made, and which he had no right to resent. Whether this authority was possessed by
                  appointment or inheritance we could not learn; but we observed that the Chiefs, as
                  well here as in other parts, were elderly men. In other parts, however, we learnt
                  that they possessed their authority by inheritance. </p><p n="856">The little societies which we found in the southern parts seemed to have
                  several things in common, particularly their fine clothes and fishing nets. Their
                  fine clothes, which possibly might be the spoils of war, were kept in a small hut,
                  which was erected for that purpose in the middle of the town: the nets we saw
                  making in almost every house, and the several parts being afterwards collected
                  were joined together. Less account seems to be made of the women here than in the
                  South Sea islands; such at least was the opinion of Tupia, who complained of it as
                  an indignity to the sex. We observed that the two sexes eat together; but how they
                  divide <pb n="472"/> their labour we do not certainly know.* I am inclined to
                  believe that the men till the ground, make nets, catch birds, and go out in their
                  boats to fish; and that the women dig up fern roots, collect lobsters and other
                  shell fish near the beach, dress the victuals, and weave cloth: such at least were
                  their employments when we had an opportunity of observing them, which was but
                  seldom; for in general our appearance made a holiday wherever we went, men, women
                  and children, flocking round us, either to gratify their curiosity, or to purchase
                  some of the valuable merchandize which we carried about with us, consisting
                  principally of nails, paper, and broken glass. </p><p n="857">*Of the religion of these people it cannot be supposed that we could learn
                  much; they acknowledge the influence of superior beings, one of whom is supreme,
                  and the rest subordinate; and gave nearly the same account of the origin of the
                  world, and the production of mankind, as our friends in Otaheite: Tupia, however,
                  seemed to have a much more deep and extensive knowlege of these subjects than any
                  of the people here; and whenever he was disposed to instruct them, which he
                  sometimes did in a long discourse, he was sure of a numerous audience, who
                  listened in profound silence, with such reverence and attention, that we could not
                  but wish them a better teacher. </p><p n="858">What homage they pay to the deities they acknowledge we could not learn;
                  but we saw no place of public worship, like the Morals of the South Sea islands:
                  yet we saw, near a plantation of sweet potatoes, a small area, of a square figure,
                  surrounded with stones, in the middle of which one of the sharpened stakes which
                  they use as a spade was set up, and upon it was hung a basket of fern roots: upon
                  enquiry, the natives told us, that it was an offering to the gods, by which <pb n="473"/> the owner hoped to render them propitious,* and obtain a plentiful
                  crop. </p><p n="859">As to their manner of disposing of their dead,* we could form no certain
                  opinion of it, for the accounts that we received by no means agreed. In the
                  northern parts, they told us that they buried them in the ground; and in the
                  southern, that they threw them into the sea: it is however certain that we saw no
                  grave in the country, and that they affected to conceal every thing relating to
                  their dead with a kind of mysterious secrecy. But whatever may be the sepulchre,
                  the living are themselves the monuments; for we saw scarcely a single person of
                  either sex whose body was not marked by the scars of wounds which they had
                  inflicted upon themselves as a testimony of their regret for the loss of a
                  relation or friend: some of these wounds we saw in a state so recent that the
                  blood was scarcely staunched, which shows that death had been among them while we
                  were upon the coast; and makes it more extraordinary that no funeral ceremony
                  should have fallen under our notice: some of the scars were very large and deep,
                  and in many instances had greatly disfigured the face. One monument indeed we
                  observed of another kind, the cross that was set up near Queen Charlotte's Sound. </p><p n="860">Having now given the best account in my power of the customs and opinions
                  of the inhabitants of New Zealand, with their boats, nets, furniture, and dress, I
                  shall only remark, that the similitude between these particulars here and in the
                  South Sea islands is a very strong proof that the inhabitants have the same
                  origin; and that the common ancestors of both, were natives of the same country.
                  They have both a tradition that their ancestors, at a very remote period of time,
                  came from another country; and, according to the <pb n="474"/> tradition of both,*
                  that the name of that country was HEAWIJE; but the similitude of the language
                  seems to put the matter altogether out of doubt. I have already observed, that
                  Tupia, when he accosted the people here in the language of his own country, was
                  perfectly understood; and I shall give a specimen of the similitude by a list of
                  words in both languages, according to the dialect of the northern and southern
                  islands of which New Zealand consists, by which it will appear that the language
                  of Otaheite does not differ more from that of New Zealand, than the language of
                  the two islands from each other. </p><p n="861">ENGLISH. NEW ZEALAND. OTAHEITE. Northern. Southern. A Chief, Eareete,

                  specimen, I think it appears to demonstration that the language of New Zealand and
                  Otaheite is radically the same. The language of the northern and southern parts of
                  New Zealand differs chiefly in the pronunciation, as the same English word is
                  pronounced gate in Middlesex, and geäte in Yorkshire: and as the southern and
                  northern words were not written down by the same person, one might possibly <pb n="476"/> use more letters to produce the same sound than the other.* </p><p n="862">I must also observe, that it is the genius of the language, especially in
                  the southern parts, to put some article before a noun, as we do the or a; the
                  articles used here were generally he or ko: it is also common here to add the word
                  öeia after another word, as an iteration, especially if it is an answer to a
                  question; as we say yes indeed, to be sure, really, certainly: this sometimes led
                  our gentlemen into the formation of words of an enormous length, judging by the
                  ear only, without being able to refer each sound into its signification. An
                  example will make this perfectly understood. </p><p n="863">In the Bay of Islands there is a remarkable one, called by the natives
                  MATU ARO. One of our gentlemen having asked a native the name of it, he answered,
                  with the particle, Kematuaro; the gentleman hearing the sound imperfectly,
                  repeated his question, and the Indian repeating his answer, added öeia, which made
                  the word Kematuaroöeia; and thus it happened that in the log book I found Matuaro
                  transformed into Cumettiwarroweia: and the same transformation, by the same means,
                  might happen to an English word. Suppose a native of New Zealand at Hackney
                  church, to enquire "what village is this?" the answer would be, "it is Hackney:"
                  suppose the question to be repeated with an air of doubt and uncertainty, the
                  answer might be "it is Hackney indeed," and the New Zealander, if he had the use
                  of letters, would probably record, for the information of his countrymen, that
                  during his residence among us he had visited a village called "Ityshakneeindede."
                  The article used by the inhabitants of the South Sea islands, instead of he or ko,
                  is to or ta, but the word öeia is common to both; and when we began to learn the
                  language, it led us into many ridiculous mistakes. </p><p n="864"><pb n="477"/>But supposing these islands, and those in the South Seas,* to have
                  been peopled originally from the same country, it will perhaps for ever remain a
                  doubt what country that is: we were, however, unanimously of opinion, that the
                  people did not come from America, which lies to the eastward; and except there
                  should appear to be a continent to the southward, in a moderate latitude, it will
                  follow that they came from the westward. </p><p n="865">Thus far our navigation has certainly been unfavourable to the notion of a
                  southern continent, for it has swept away at least three-fourths of the positions
                  upon which it has been founded. The principal navigators, whose authority has been
                  urged on this occasion, are Tasman, Juan Fernandes, Hermite, the commander of a
                  Dutch squadron, Quiros, and Roggewein; and the track of the Endeavour has
                  demonstrated that the land seen by these persons, and supposed to be part of a
                  continent, is not so; it has also totally subverted the theoretical arguments
                  which have been brought to prove that the existence of a southern continent is
                  necessary to preserve an equilibrium between the two hemispheres; for upon this
                  principle what we have already proved to be water, would render the southern
                  hemisphere → too light. In our rout to the northward, after doubling Cape Horn,
                  when we were in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="84">40°</geo>, our longitude was <geo select="lon" n="84">110°</geo>;
                  and in our return to the southward, after leaving Ulietea, when we were again in
                  latitude <geo select="lat" n="85">40°</geo>, our longitude was <geo select="lon" n="85">145°</geo>; the difference is
                  <geo select="lon">35°</geo>. When we were in latitude <geo select="lat">30°</geo> the difference of
                  longitude between the two tracks was <geo select="lon">21°</geo>, which continued till we were
                  as low as <geo select="lon">20°</geo>; but a single view of the chart will convey a better idea
                  of this than the most minute description: yet as upon a view of the chart it will
                  appear that there is a large space extending quite to the Tropics, which <pb n="478"/> neither we,* nor any other navigators to our knowlege have explored,
                  and as there will appear to be room enough for the Cape of a southern continent to
                  extend northward into a low southern latitude, I shall give my reasons for
                  believing there is no Cape, of any southern continent, to the northward of
                  <geo select="lat">40° s</geo>outh. </p><p n="866">Notwithstanding what has been laid down by some geographers in their maps,
                  and alleged by Mr. Dalrymple, with respect to Quiros, it is improbable in the
                  highest degree that he saw to the southward of two islands, which he discovered in
                  latitude 25 or 26, and which I suppose may lie between the longitude of
                     <geo select="lon">130°</geo> and <geo select="lon">140° W</geo>. any signs of a continent, much less any
                  thing which, in his opinion, was a known or indubitable sign of such land; for if
                  he had, he would certainly have sailed southward in search of it, and if he had
                  sought, supposing the signs to have been indubitable, he must have found: the
                  discovery of a southern continent was the ultimate object of Quiros's voyage, and
                  no man appears to have had it more at heart; so that if he was in latitude
                  <geo select="lat">26° S</geo>. and in longitude <geo select="lon">146° W</geo>. where Mr. Dalrymple has
                  placed the islands he discovered, it may fairly be inferred that no part of a
                  southern continent extends to that latitude. </p><p n="867">It will, I think, appear with equal evidence from the accounts of
                  Roggewein's voyage, that between the longitudes of <geo select="lon">130°</geo> and <geo select="lon">150°
                     W</geo>. there is no main land to the northward of <geo select="lat">35° S</geo>. Mr.
                  Pingre, in a treatise concerning the transit of Venus, which he went out to
                  observe, has inserted an extract of Roggewein's voyage, and a map of the South
                  Seas; and for reasons which may be seen at large in his work, supposes him, after
                  leaving Easter Island, which he places in latitude 28 ½ S. longitude <geo select="lon">123°
                     W</geo>. to have steered S.W. as high as <pb n="479"/><geo select="lat">34° S</geo>. and afterwards W.N.W.;* and if this was indeed his rout, the
                  proof that there is no main land to the northward of <geo select="lat">35° S</geo>. is
                  irrefragable. Mr. Dalrymple indeed supposes his rout to have been different, and
                  that from Easter Isle he steered N.W. taking a course afterwards very little
                  different from that of La Maire; but I think it is highly improbable that a man,
                  who at his own request was sent to discover a southern continent, should take a
                  course in which La Maire had already proved no continent could be found: it must
                  however be confessed, that Roggewein's track cannot certainly be ascertained,
                  because in the accounts that have been published of his voyage, neither longitudes
                  nor latitudes are mentioned. As to myself I saw nothing that I thought a sign of
                  land, in my rout either to the northward, southward, or westward, till a few days
                  before I made the east coast of New Zealand: I did indeed frequently see large
                  flocks of birds, but they were generally such as are found at a very remote
                  distance from any coast; and it is also true that I frequently saw pieces of
                  rock-weed, but I could not infer the vicinity of land from these, because I have
                  been informed, upon indubitable authority, that a considerable quantity of the
                  beans called ox-eyes, which are known to grow no where but in the West Indies, are
                  every year thrown up on the coast of Ireland, which is not less than twelve
                  hundred leagues distant. </p><p n="868">Thus have I given my reasons for thinking that there is no continent to
                  the northward of latitude <geo select="lat">40° S</geo>.; of what may lie farther to the
                  southward than <geo select="lat">40°</geo> I can give no opinion; but I am so far from wishing
                  to discourage any future attempt, finally to determine a question which has long
                  been an object of attention to many nations; that now this voyage has reduced the
                  only possible scite of a continent in the southern hemisphere → , north of

                  pity to leave that any longer unexamined, especially as the voyage may turn to
                  good account, besides determining the principal question, if no continent should
                  be found, by the discovery of new islands in the Tropical regions, of which there
                  is probably a great number, that no European vessel has ever yet visited. Tupia
                  from time to time gave us an account of about one hundred and thirty, and in a
                  chart drawn by his own hand, he actually laid down no less than seventy-four. </p><p n="869"><!--Page  [unnumbered]--></p><p n="870">[illustration] ENTRANCE of ENDEAVOUR RIVER, IN NEW SOUTH WALES. Lat:

                  our latitude,* by observation, was <geo select="lat" n="87">40°</geo>, our longitude from Cape

                  which is two degrees and an half more than the day before, though I expected to
                  have found it less. </p><p n="878">*In the course of the <date>13th</date>, being in latitude <geo select="lat" n="89">39° 33′ S</geo>.
                  longitude <geo select="lon" n="89">204° 2′W</geo>. I found the variation to be <geo select="lon">12° 27′ E</geo>.
                  and in the morning of the <date>14th</date>,* it was <geo select="lon">11° 30′</geo>; this day we also saw
                  some flying fish.* On the <date>15th</date>, we saw an egg bird and a gannet, and as these are
                  birds that never go far from the land, we continued to sound all night, but had no
                  ground with 130 fathom.* At noon on the <date>16th</date>, we were in latitude <geo select="lat" n="90">39° 45′
                     S</geo>. longitude <geo select="lon" n="90">208° W</geo>. At about two o'clock the wind came about
                  to the W. S. W. upon which we tacked and stood to the N. W.; soon after a small
                  land-bird perched upon the rigging, but we had no ground with 120 fathom. At eight
                  we wore and stood to the southward till twelve at night, and then wore and stood
                  to the N. W. till four in the morning,* when we again stood to the southward,
                  having a fresh gale at W. S. W. with squalls and dark weather till nine, when the
                  weather became clear, and there being little wind, we had an opportunity to take
                  several observations of the sun and moon, the mean result of which gave <geo select="lon">207°
                     56′W</geo>. longitude: our latitude at noon was <geo select="lat">39° 36′ S</geo>. We had
                  now a hard gale from the southward, and a great sea from the same quarter, which
                  obliged us to run under our fore-sail and mizen all night, during which we sounded
                  every two hours, but had no ground with 120 fathom. </p><p n="879">*In the morning of the <date>18th</date>, we saw two Port Egmont hens, and a pintado
                  bird, which are certain signs of approaching land, and indeed by our reckoning we
                  could not be far from it, for our longitude was now one degree to the westward of
                  the eastside of Van Diemen's land, according to <pb n="483"/> the longitude laid
                  down by Tasman,* whom we could not suppose to have erred much in so short a run as
                  from this land to New Zealand, and by our latitude we could not be above fifty or
                  fifty-five leagues from the place whence he took his departure. All this day we
                  had frequent squalls and a great swell.* Atone in the morning we brought to and
                  sounded, but had no ground with 130 fathom; at six we saw land extending from N.
                  E. to W. at the distance of five or six leagues, having eighty fathom water with a
                  fine sandy bottom. </p><p n="880">We continued standing westward, with the wind at S. S. W. till eight, when
                  we made all the sail we could, and bore away along the shore N. E. for the
                  eastermost land in fight, being at this time in latitude <geo select="lat" n="91">37° 58′ S</geo>. and
                  longitude <geo select="lon" n="91">210° 39′ W</geo>. The southermost point of land in sight, which
                  bore from us W. ¼ S. I judged to lie in latitude <geo select="lat" n="92">38°</geo>, longitude
                  <geo select="lon" n="92">211° 7′</geo>, and gave it the name of POINT HICKS, because Mr. Hicks, the
                  First Lieutenant, was the first who discovered it. To the southward of this Point
                  no land was to be seen, though it was very clear in that quarter, and by our
                  longitude, compared with that of Tasman, not as it is laid down in the printed
                  charts, but in the extracts from Tasman's journal, published by Rembrantse, the
                  body of Van Diemen's land ought to have borne due south; and indeed, from the
                  sudden falling of the sea after the wind abated, I had reason to think it did; yet
                  as I did not see it, and as I found this coast trend N. E. and S. W. or rather
                  more to the eastward, I cannot determine whether it joins to Van Diemen's land or
                  not. </p><p n="881">At noon, we were in latitude <geo select="lat" n="93">37° 50′</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon" n="93">210°
                     29′W</geo>. The extreams of the land extended from N. W. to E. N. E and a
                  remarkable point bore N. 20 E. at the distance of about four <pb n="484"/>
                  leagues.* This point rises in a round hillock, very much resembling the Ram Head
                  at the entrance of Plymouth Sound, and therefore I called it by the same name. The
                  variation by an azimuth, taken this morning, was <geo select="lon">3° 7′ E</geo>.; and what we
                  had now seen of the land, appeared low and level: the sea shore was a white sand,
                  but the country within was green and woody. About one o'clock, we saw three water
                  spouts at once; two were between us and the shore, and the third at some distance,
                  upon our larboard quarter: this phaenomenon is so well known, that it is not
                  necessary to give a particular description of it here. </p><p n="882">At six o'clock in the evening, we shortened sail, and brought to for the
                  night, having fifty-six fathom water, and a fine sandy bottom. The northermost
                  land in sight then bore N. by E. ½ E. and a small island lying close to a point on
                  the main bore W. distant two leagues. This point, which I called CAPE HOWE, may be
                  known by the trending of the coast, which is north on the one side, and south west
                  on the other; it may also be known by some round hills upon the main, just within
                  it. </p><p n="883">*We brought to for the night, and at four in the morning made sail along
                  shore to the northward. At six, the northermost land in sight bore N. N. W. and we
                  were at this time about four leagues from the shore. At noon, we were in latitude
                  <geo select="lat" n="94">36° 51′ S</geo>. longitude <geo select="lon" n="94">209° 53′ W</geo>. and about three leagues
                  distant from the shore. The weather being clear, gave us a good view of the
                  country, which has a very pleasing appearance: it is of a moderate height,
                  diversified by hills and vallies, ridges and plains, interspersed with a few lawns
                  of no great extent, but in general covered with wood: the ascent of the hills and
                  ridges is gentle, and the summits are not high. We continued to sail along the
                  shore <pb n="485"/> to the northward, with a southerly wind,* and in the afternoon
                  we saw smoke in several places, by which we knew the country to be inhabited. At
                  six in the evening, we shortened sail, and sounded: we found forty-four fathom
                  water, with a clear sandy bottom, and stood on under an easy sail till twelve,
                  when we brought to for the night, and had ninety fathom water. </p><p n="884">At four in the morning, we made sail again,* at the distance of about five
                  leagues from the land, and at six, we were abreast of a high mountain, lying near
                  the shore, which, on account of its figure, I called MOUNT DROMEDARY: under this
                  mountain the shore forms a point, to which I gave the name of POINT DROMEDARY, and
                  over it there is a peaked hillock. At this time, being in latitude <geo select="lat" n="95">36° 18′
                     S</geo>. longitude <geo select="lon" n="95">209° 55′ W</geo>. we found the variation to be <geo select="lon">10°
                     42′ E</geo>. </p><p n="885">Between ten and eleven, Mr. Green and I took several observations of the
                  sun and moon, the mean result of which gave <geo select="lon">209° 17′</geo> longitude W. By an
                  observation made the day before, our longitude was <geo select="lon">210° 9′ W</geo>. from
                  which, 20′ being subtracted, there remains <geo select="lon">209° 49′</geo> the longitude of
                  the ship this day at noon, the mean of which, with this day's observation, gives
                     <geo select="lon">209° 33′</geo>, by which I fix the longitude of this coast. At noon, our
                  latitude was <geo select="lat">35° 49′ S</geo>. Cape Dromedary bore S, 30 W. at the distance of
                  twelve leagues, and an open bay, in which were three or four small islands, bore
                  N. W. by W. at the distance of five or six leagues. This bay seemed to afford but
                  little shelter from the sea winds, and yet it is the only place where there
                  appeared a probability of finding anchorage upon the whole coast. We continued to
                  steer along the shore N. by E. and N. N. E. at the distance of about three
                  leagues, and saw smoke in many places near <pb n="486"/> the beach.* At five in
                  the evening, we were abreast of a point of land which rose in a perpendicular
                  cliff, and which, for that reason, I called POINT UPRIGHT. Our latitude was
                  <geo select="lat">35° 35′ S</geo>. when this Point bore from us due west, distant about two
                  leagues: in this situation, we had about thirty-one fathom water with a sandy
                  bottom. At six in the evening, the wind falling, we hauled off E. N. E. and at
                  this time the northermost land in sight bore N. by E. ½ E. At midnight, being in
                  seventy fathom water, we brought to till four in the morning,* when we made sail
                  in for the land; but at day-break, found our situation nearly the same as it had
                  been at five the evening before, by which it was apparent that we had been driven
                  about three leagues to the southward, by a tide or current, during the night.
                  After this we steered along the shore N. N. E. with a gentle breeze at S. W. and
                  were so near the land as to distinguish several of the natives upon the beach, who
                  appeared to be of a black, or very dark colour. At noon, our latitude, by
                  observation, was <geo select="lat" n="96">35° 27′ S</geo>. and longitude <geo select="lon" n="96">209° 23′W</geo>. Cape
                  Dromedary bore S. 28 W. distant nineteen leagues, a remarkable peaked hill, which
                  resembled a square dove-house, with a dome at the top, and which for that reason I
                  called the PIGEON HOUSE, bore N. <geo select="lon">32° 30′ W</geo>. and a small low island,
                  which lay close under the shore, bore N. W. distant about two or three leagues.
                  When I first discovered this island, in the morning, I was in hopes, from its
                  appearance, that I should have found shelter for the ship behind it, but when we
                  came near it, it did not promise security even for the landing of a boat: I should
                  however have attempted to send a boat on shore, if the wind had not veered to that
                  direction, with a large hollow sea rolling in upon the land from the S. E. which
                  indeed had been the case ever since we had been upon it. The coast still continued
                  to be of a moderate height, forming alternately <pb n="487"/> rocky points and
                  sandy beaches; but within,* between Mount Dromedary and the Pigeon House, we saw
                  high mountains, which, except two, are covered with wood: these two lie inland
                  behind the Pigeon House, and are remarkably flat at the top, with steep rocky
                  cliffs all round them, as far as we could see. The trees which almost every where
                  clothe this country, appear to be large and lofty. This day the variation was
                  found to be <geo select="lon">9° 50′ E</geo>. and for the two last days, the latitude, by
                  observation, was twelve or fourteen miles to the southward of the ship's account,
                  which could have been the effect of nothing but a current setting in that
                  direction. About four in the afternoon, being near five leagues from the land, we
                  tacked and stood off S. E. and E. and the wind having veered in the night, from E.
                  to N. E. and N. we tacked about four in the morning, and stood in,* being then
                  about nine or ten leagues from the shore. At eight, the wind began to die away,
                  and soon after it was calm. At noon, our latitude, by observation, was <geo select="lat">35°
                     38′</geo>, and our distance from the land about six leagues. Cape Dromedary
                  bore S. 37 W. distant seventeen leagues, and the Pigeon House N. 40 W.: in this
                  situation we had seventy-four fathom water. In the afternoon, we had variable
                  light airs and calms, till six in the evening, when a breeze sprung up at N. by
                  W.: at this time, being about four or five leagues from the shore, we had seventy
                  fathom water. The Pigeon House bore N. 45 W. Mount Dromedary S. 30 W. and the
                  northermost land in sight N. 19 E. </p><p n="886">We stood to the north east till noon the next day,* with a gentle breeze
                  at N. W. and then we tacked and stood westward. At this time, our latitude, by
                  observation, was <geo select="lat" n="97">35° 10′S</geo>. and longitude <geo select="lon" n="97">208° 51′ W</geo>. A point
                  of land which I had discovered on St. George's day, and which therefore I called
                  CAPE GEORGE, bore W. distant nineteen miles, and the <pb n="488"/> Pigeon House,*
                  (the latitude and longitude of which I found to be <geo select="lat" n="98">35° 19′ S</geo>. and
                  <geo select="lon" n="98">209° 42′W</geo>.) S. 75 W. In the morning, we had found the variation, by
                  amplitude, to be <geo select="lon">7° 50′ E</geo>. and by several azimuths <geo select="lon">7° 54′ E</geo>.
                  We had a fresh breeze at N. W. from noon till three; it then came to the west,
                  when we tacked and stood to the northward. At five in the evening, being about
                  five or six leagues from the shore, with the Pigeon House bearing W. S. W. distant
                  about nine leagues, we had eighty-six fathom water; and at eight, having thunder
                  and lightning, with heavy squalls, we brought to in 120 fathom. </p><p n="887">*At three in the morning, we made sail again to the northward, having the
                  advantage of a fresh gale at S. W. At noon, we were about three or four leagues
                  from the shore, and in latitude <geo select="lat" n="99">34° 22′ S</geo>. longitude <geo select="lon" n="99">208° 36′
                     W</geo>. In the course of this day's run from the preceding noon, which was
                  forty-five miles north east, we saw smoke in several places near the beach. About
                  two leagues to the northward of Cape George, the shore seemed to form a bay, which
                  promised shelter from the north east winds, but as the wind was with us, it was
                  not in my power to look into it without beating up, which would have cost me more
                  time than I was willing to spare. The north point of this bay, on account of its
                  figure, I named LONG NOSE; its latitude is <geo select="lat">35° 6′</geo>, and about eight
                  leagues north of it there lies a point, which, from the colour of the land about
                  it, I called RED POINT: its latitude is <geo select="lat" n="100">34° 29′</geo>, and longitude
                  <geo select="lon" n="100">208° 45′W</geo>. To the north west of Red Point, and a little way inland,
                  stands a round hill, the top of which looks like the crown of a hat. In the
                  afternoon of this day, we had a light breeze at N. N. W. till five in the evening,
                  when it fell calm: at this time, we were between three and four leagues from the
                  shore, and had forty-eight fathom water: the variation by azimuth was <geo select="lon">8° 48′
                     E</geo>. <pb n="489"/> and the extremities of this land were from N. E. by N.
                  to S. W. by S. Before it was dark,* we saw smoke in several places along the
                  shore, and a fire two or three times afterwards. During the night we lay becalmed,
                  driving in before the sea till one in the morning,* when we got a breeze from the
                  land, with which we steered N. E. being then in thirty-eight fathom. At noon, it
                  veered to N. E. by N. and we were then in latitude <geo select="lat" n="101">34° 10′ S</geo>. longitude
                  <geo select="lon" n="101">208° 27′ W</geo>.: the land was distant about five leagues, and extended
                  from S. 37 W. to N. ½ E. In this latitude, there are some white cliffs, which rise
                  perpendicularly from the sea to a considerable height. We stood off the shore till
                  two o'clock, and then tacked and stood in till six, when we were within four or
                  five miles of it, and at that distance had fifty fathom water. The extremities of
                  the land bore from S. 28 W. to N. <geo select="lon">25° 30 E</geo>. We now tacked and stood off
                  till twelve, then tacked and stood in again till four in the morning,* when we
                  made a trip off till daylight; and during all this time we lost ground, owing to
                  the variableness of the winds. We continued at the distance of between four and
                  five miles from the shore, till the afternoon, when we came within two miles, and
                  I then hoisted out the pinnace and yawl to attempt a landing, but the pinnace
                  proved to be so leaky that I was obliged to hoist her in again. At this time we
                  saw several of the natives walking briskly along the shore, four of whom carried a
                  small canoe upon their shoulders: we flattered ourselves that they were going to
                  put her into the water, and come off to the ship, but finding ourselves
                  disappointed, I determined to go on shore in the yawl, with as many as it would
                  carry: I embarked therefore, with only Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, Tupia, and four
                  rowers: we pulled for that part of the shore where the Indians appeared, near
                  which four small canoes were lying at the water's edge, <pb n="490"/> The Indians
                  sat down upon the rocks,* and seemed to wait for our landing; but to our great
                  regret, when we came within about a quarter of a mile, they ran away into the
                  woods: we determined however to go ashore, and endeavour to procure an interview,
                  but in this we were again disappointed, for we found so great a surf beating upon
                  every part of the beach, that landing with our little boat was altogether
                  impracticable: we were therefore obliged to be content with gazing at such objects
                  as presented themselves from the water: the canoes, upon a near view, seemed very
                  much to resemble those of the smaller sort at New Zealand. We observed, that among
                  the trees on shore, which were not very large, there was no underwood; and could
                  distinguish that many of them were of the palm kind, and some of them cabbage
                  trees: after many a wishful look we were obliged to return, with our curiosity
                  rather excited than satisfied, and about five in the evening got on board the
                  ship. About this time it fell calm, and our situation was by no means agreeable:
                  we were now not more than a mile and a half from the shore, and within some
                  breakers, which lay to the southward, but happily a light breeze came off the
                  land, and carried us out of danger: with this breeze we stood to the northward,*
                  and at day-break we discovered a bay, which seemed to be well sheltered from all
                  winds, and into which therefore I determined to go with the ship. The pinnace
                  being repaired, I sent her, with the Master, to sound the entrance, while I kept
                  turning up, having the wind right out. At noon, the mouth of the bay bore N. N. W.
                  distant about a mile, and seeing a smoke on the shore, we directed our glasses to
                  the spot, and soon discovered ten people, who, upon our nearer approach, left
                  their fire, and retired to a little eminence, whence they could conveniently
                  observe our motions. Soon after two canoes, each having two men on <pb n="491"/>
                  board, came to the shore just under the eminence,* and the men joined the rest on
                  the top of it. The pinnace, which had been sent ahead to sound, now approached the
                  place, upon which all the Indians retired farther up the hill, except one, who hid
                  himself among some rocks near the landing-place. As the pinnace proceeded along
                  the shore, most of the people took the same route, and kept abreast of her at a
                  distance; when she came back, the master told us, that in a cove a little within
                  the harbour, some of them had come down to the beach, and invited him to land by
                  many signs and words of which he knew not the meaning; but that all of them were
                  armed with long pikes, and a wooden weapon shaped somewhat like a cimeter. The
                  Indians who had not followed the boat, seeing the ship approach, used many
                  threatening gestures, and brandished their weapons; particularly two, who made a
                  very singular appearance, for their faces seemed to have been dusted with a white
                  powder, and their bodies painted with broad streaks of the same colour, which
                  passing obliquely over their breasts and backs, looked not unlike the cross-belts
                  worn by our soldiers; the same kind of streaks were also drawn round their legs
                  and thighs like broad garters: each of these men held in his hand the weapon that
                  had been described to us as like a cimeter, which appeared to be about two feet
                  and a half long, and they seemed to talk to each other with great earnestness. </p><p n="888">We continued to stand into the bay, and early in the afternoon anchored
                  under the south shore, about two miles within the entrance, in six fathom water,
                  the south point bearing S. E. and the north point East. As we came in we saw, on
                  both points of the bay, a few huts, and several of the natives, men, women, and
                  children. Under the south head <pb n="492"/> we saw four small canoes,* with each
                  one man on board, who were very busily employed in striking fish with a long pike
                  or spear: they ventured almost into the surf, and were so intent upon what they
                  were doing, that although the ship passed within a quarter of a mile of them, they
                  scarcely turned their eyes towards her; possibly being deafened by the surf, and
                  their attention wholly fixed upon their business or sport, they neither saw nor
                  heard her go past them. </p><p n="889">The place where the ship had anchored was abreast of a small village,
                  consisting of about six or eight houses; and while we were preparing to hoist out
                  the boat, we saw an old woman, followed by three children, come out of the wood;
                  she was loaded with fire-wood, and each of the children had also its little
                  burden: when she came to the houses three more children, younger than the others,
                  came out to meet her: she often looked at the ship, but expressed neither fear nor
                  surprise: in a short time she kindled a fire, and the four canoes came in from
                  fishing. The men landed, and having hauled up their boars, began to dress their
                  dinner, to all appearance wholly unconcerned about us, though we were within half
                  a mile of them. We thought it remarkable that of all the people we had yet seen,
                  not one had the least appearance of clothing, the old woman herself being
                  destitute even of a fig-leaf. </p><p n="890">After dinner the boats were manned, and we set out from the ship, having
                  Tupia of our party. We intended to land where we saw the people, and began to hope
                  that as they had so little regarded the ship's coming into the bay, they would as
                  little regard our coming on shore: in this, however, we were disappointed; for as
                  soon as we approached the rocks, two of the men came down upon them to dispute our
                  landing, and the rest ran away. Each of the two <pb n="493"/> champions was armed
                  with a lance about ten feet long,* and a short stick which he seemed to handle as
                  if it was a machine to assist him in managing or throwing the lance: they called
                  to us in a very loud tone, and in a harsh dissonant language, of which neither we
                  nor Tupia understood a single word: they brandished their weapons, and seemed
                  resolved to defend their coast to the uttermost, though they were but two, and we
                  were forty. I could not but admire their courage, and being very unwilling that
                  hostilities should commence with such inequality of force between us, I ordered
                  the boat to lie upon her oars: we then parlied by signs for about a quarter of an
                  hour, and to bespeak their good-will, I threw them nails, beads, and other
                  trifles, which they took up and seemed to be well pleased with. I then made signs
                  that I wanted water, and, by all the means that I could devise, endeavoured to
                  convince them that we would do them no harm: they now waved to us, and I was
                  willing to interpret it as an invitation; but upon our putting the boat in, they
                  came again to oppose us. One appeared to be a youth about nineteen or twenty, and
                  the other a man of middle age: as I had now no other resource I fired a musquet
                  between them. Upon the report, the youngest dropped a bundle of lances upon the
                  rock, but recollecting himself in an instant he snatched them up again with great
                  haste: a stone was then thrown at us, upon which I ordered a musquet to be fired
                  with small shot, which struck the eldest upon the legs, and he immediately ran to
                  one of the houses, which was distant about an hundred yards: I now hoped that our
                  contest was over, and we immediately landed; but we had scarcely left the boat
                  when he returned, and we then perceived that he had left the rock only to fetch a
                  shield or target for his defence. As soon as he came up, he threw a lance at us,
                  and his comrade another; they fell where we <pb n="494"/> stood thickest,* but
                  happily hurt nobody. A third musquet with small shot was then fired at them, upon
                  which one of them threw another lance, and both immediately ran away: if we had
                  pursued, we might probably have taken one of them; but Mr. Banks suggesting that
                  the lances might be poisoned, I thought it not prudent to venture into the woods.
                  We repaired immediately to the huts, in one of which we found the children, who
                  had hidden themselves behind a shield and some bark; we peeped at them, but left
                  them in their retreat, without their knowing that they had been discovered, and we
                  threw into the house when we went away some beads, ribbons, pieces of cloth, and
                  other presents, which we hoped would procure us the good-will of the inhabitants
                  when they should return; but the lances which we found lying about, we took away
                  with us, to the number of about fifty: they were from six to fifteen feet long,
                  and all of them had four prongs in the manner of a fish-gig, each of which was
                  pointed with fish-bone, and very sharp: we observed that they were smeared with a
                  viscous substance of a green colour, which favoured the opinion of their being
                  poisoned, though we afterwards discovered that it was a mistake: they appeared, by
                  the sea-weed that we found sticking to them, to have been used in striking fish.
                  Upon examining the canoes that lay upon the beach, we found them to be the worst
                  we had ever seen: they were between twelve and fourteen feet long, and made of the
                  bark of a tree in one piece, which was drawn together and tied up at each end, the
                  middle being kept open by sticks which were placed across them from gunwale to
                  gunwale as thwarts. We then searched for fresh water, but found none, except in a
                  small hole which had been dug in the sand. </p><p n="891">Having reimbarked in our boat, we deposited our lances on board the ship,
                  and then went over to the north point of <pb n="495"/> the bay,* where we had seen
                  several of the inhabitants when we were entering it, but which we now found
                  totally deserted. Here however we found fresh water, which trickled down from the
                  top of the rocks, and stood in pools among the hollows at the bottom; but it was
                  situated so as not to be procured for our use without difficulty. </p><p n="892">In the morning, therefore,* I sent a party of men to that part of the
                  shore where we first landed, with orders to dig holes in the sand where the water
                  might gather; but going ashore myself with the Gentlemen soon afterwards, we
                  found, upon a more diligent search, a small stream, more than sufficient for our
                  purpose. </p><p n="893">Upon visiting the hut where we had seen the children, we were greatly
                  mortified to find that the beads and ribbons which we had left there the night
                  before, had not been moved from their places, and that not an Indian was to be
                  seen. </p><p n="894">Having sent some empty water-casks on shore; and left a party of men to
                  cut wood, I went myself in the pinnace to sound, and examine the bay; during my
                  excursion I saw several of the natives, but they all fled at my approach. In one
                  of the places where I landed I found several small fires, and fresh muscles
                  broiling upon them; here also I found some of the largest oyster-shells I had ever
                  seen. </p><p n="895">As soon as the wooders and waterers came on board to dinner, ten or twelve
                  of the natives came down to the place, and looked with great attention and
                  curiosity at the casks, but did not touch them: they took away however the canoes
                  which lay near the landing-place, and again disappeared. In the afternoon, when
                  our people were again ashore, sixteen or eighteen Indians, all armed, came boldly
                  within about an hundred yards of them, and then stopped: two of <pb n="496"/> them
                  advanced somewhat nearer;* and Mr. Hicks, who commanded the party on shore, with
                  another, advanced to meet them, holding out presents to them as he approached, and
                  expressing kindness and amity by every sign he could think of, but all without
                  effect; for before he could get up with them they retired, and it would have
                  answered no purpose to pursue. In the evening, I went with Mr. Banks and Dr.
                  Solander to a sandy cove on the north side of the bay, where, in three or four
                  hauls with the seine, we took above three hundred weight of fish, which was
                  equally divided among the ship's company. </p><p n="896">*The next morning, before day-break, the Indians came down to the houses
                  that were abreast of the ship, and were heard frequently to shout very loud. As
                  soon as it was light, they were seen walking along the beach; and soon after they
                  retired to the woods, where, at the distance of about a mile from the shore, they
                  kindled several fires. </p><p n="897">Our people went ashore as usual, and with them Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander,
                  who, in search of plants, repaired to the woods. Our men, who were employed in
                  cutting grass, being the farthest removed from the main body of the people, a
                  company of fourteen or fifteen Indians advanced towards them, having sticks in
                  their hands, which, according to the report of the Serjeant of the marines, shone
                  like a musquet. The grass-cutters, upon seeing them approach, drew together, and
                  repaired to the main body. The Indians, being encouraged by this appearance of a
                  flight, pursued them; they stopped however when they were within about a furlong
                  of them, and after shouting several times went back into the woods. In the evening
                  they came again in the same manner, stopped at the same distance, shouted and
                  retired. I followed them myself, alone and unarmed, for a <pb n="497"/>
                  considerable way along the shore,* but I could not prevail upon them to stop. </p><p n="898">This day Mr. Green took the sun's meridian altitude a little within the
                  south entrance of the bay, which gave the latitude <geo select="lat">34° S</geo>. the variation
                  of the needle was <geo select="lon">11° 3′ E</geo>. </p><p n="899">Early the next morning, the body of Forby Sutherland,* one of our seamen,
                  who died the evening before, was buried near the watering-place; and from this
                  incident I called the south point of this bay SUTHERLAND POINT. This day we
                  resolved to make an excursion into the country. Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, myself,
                  and seven others, properly accoutred for the expedition, set out, and repaired
                  first to the huts, near the watering-place, whither some of the natives continued
                  every day to resort; and though the little presents which we had left there before
                  had not yet been taken away, we left others of somewhat more value, consisting of
                  cloth, looking-glasses, combs, and beads, and then went up into the country. We
                  found the soil to be either swamp or light sand, and the face of the country
                  finely diversified by wood and lawn. The trees are tall, strait, and without
                  underwood, standing at such a distance from each other that the whole country, at
                  least where the swamps do not render it incapable of cultivation, might be
                  cultivated without cutting down one of them: between the trees the ground is
                  covered with grass, of which there is great abundance, growing in tufts about as
                  big as can well be grasped in the hand, which stand very close to each other. We
                  saw many houses of the inhabitants, and places where they had slept upon the grass
                  without any shelter; but we saw only one of the people, who the moment he
                  discovered us ran away. At all these places we left presents, hoping that at
                  length they might produce confidence and good-will. We <pb n="498"/> had a
                  transient and imperfect view of a quadruped about as big as a rabbit:* Mr. Banks's
                  greyhound, which was with us, got sight of it, and would probably have caught it,
                  but the moment he set off he lamed himself, against a stump which lay concealed in
                  the long grass. We afterwards saw the dung of an animal which fed upon grass, and
                  which we judged could not be less than a deer; and the footsteps of another, which
                  was clawed like a dog, and seemed to be about as big as a wolf: we also tracked a
                  small animal, whose foot resembled that of a polcat or weasel. The trees over our
                  head abounded with birds of various kinds, among which were many of exquisite
                  beauty, particularly loriquets and cockatoos, which flew in flocks of several
                  scores together. We found some wood which had been felled by the natives with a
                  blunt instrument, and some that had been barked. The trees were not of many
                  species; among others there was a large one which yielded a gum not unlike the
                  Sanguis draconis; and in some of them steps had been cut at about three feet
                  distance from each other, for the convenience of climbing them. </p><p n="900">From this excursion we returned between three and four o'clock, and having
                  dined on board, we went ashore again at the waterring-place, where a party of men
                  were filling casks. Mr. Gore, the Second Lieutenant, had been sent out in the
                  morning with a boat to dredge for oysters at the head of the bay; when he had
                  performed this service, he went ashore, and having taken a midshipman with him,
                  and sent the boat away, set out to join the waterers by land. In his way he fell
                  in with a body of two and twenty Indians, who followed him, and were often not
                  more than twenty yards distant; when Mr. Gore perceived them so near, he stopped,
                  and faced about, upon which they stopped also; and when he went <pb n="499"/> on
                  again, continued their pursuit:* they did not however attack him, though they were
                  all armed with lances, and he and the midshipman got in safety to the
                  watering-place. The Indians, who had slackened their pursuit when they came in
                  sight of the main body of our people, halted at about the distance of a quarter of
                  a mile, where they stood still. Mr. Monkhouse and two or three of the waterers
                  took it in their head to march up to them; but seeing the Indians keep their
                  ground till they came pretty near them, they were seized with a sudden fear very
                  common to the rash and fool-hardy, and made a hasty retreat: this step, which
                  insured the danger that it was taken to avoid, encouraged the Indians, and four of
                  them running forward discharged their lances at the fugitives, with such force
                  that, flying no less than forty yards, they went beyond them. As the Indians did
                  not pursue, our people, recovering their spirits, stopped to collect the lances
                  when they came up to the place where they lay; upon which the Indians, in their
                  turn, began to retire. Just at this time I came up, with Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander,
                  and Tupia; and being desirous to convince the Indians that we were neither afraid
                  of them, nor intended them any mischief, we advanced towards them, making signs of
                  expostulation and entreaty, but they could not be persuaded to wait till we could
                  come up. Mr. Gore told us, that he had seen some of them up the bay, who had
                  invited him by signs to come on shore, which he, certainly with great prudence,
                  declined. </p><p n="901">The morning of the next day was so rainy,* that we were all glad to stay
                  on board. In the afternoon, however, it cleared up, and we made another excursion
                  along the sea-coast to the southward: we went ashore, and Mr. Banks and Dr.
                  Solander gathered many plants; but besides these we saw nothing worthy of notice.
                  At our first entering the <pb n="500"/> woods,* we met with three of the natives,
                  who instantly ran away: more of them were seen by some of the people, but they all
                  disappeared, with great precipitation, as soon as they found that they were
                  discovered. By the boldness of these people at our first landing, and the terror
                  that seized them at the sight of us afterwards, it appears that they were
                  sufficiently intimidated by our fire-arms: not that we had any reason to think the
                  people much hurt by the small-shot which we were obliged to fire at them, when
                  they attacked us at our coming out of the boat; but they had probably seen the
                  effects of them, from their lurking places, upon the birds that we had shot.
                  Tupia, who was now become a good marksman, frequently strayed from us to shoot
                  parrots; and he had told us, that while he was thus employed, he had once met with
                  nine Indians, who, as soon as they perceived he saw them, ran from him, in great
                  confusion and terror. </p><p n="902">*The next day, twelve canoes, in each of which was a single Indian, came
                  towards the watering-place, and were within half a mile of it a considerable time:
                  they were employed in striking fish, upon which, like others that we had seen
                  before, they were so intent that they seemed to regard nothing else. It happened,
                  however, that a party of our people were out a shooting near the place, and one of
                  the men, whose curiosity might at length perhaps be roused by the report of the
                  fowling-pieces, was observed by Mr. Banks to haul up his canoe upon the beach, and
                  go towards the shooting party: in something more than a quarter of an hour he
                  returned, launched his canoe, and went off in her to his companions. This incident
                  makes it probable that the natives acquired a knowlege of the destructive power of
                  our firearms, when we knew nothing of the matter; for this man <pb n="501"/> was
                  not seen by any of the party whose operations he had reconnoitred.* </p><p n="903">While Mr. Banks was gathering plants near the watering-place, I went with
                  Dr. Solander and Mr. Monkhouse to the head of the bay, that I might examine that
                  part of the country, and make farther attempts to form some connection with the
                  natives. In our way we met with eleven or twelve small canoes, with each a man in
                  it, probably the same that were afterwards abreast of the shore, who all made into
                  shoal water upon our approach. We met other Indians on shore the first time we
                  landed, who instantly took to their canoes, and paddled away. We went up the
                  country to some distance, and found the face of it nearly the same with that which
                  has been described already, but the soil was much richer; for instead of sand, I
                  found a deep black mould, which I thought very fit for the production of grain of
                  any kind. In the woods we found a tree which bore fruit that in colour and shape
                  resembled a cherry; the juice had an agreeable tartness, though but little
                  flavour. We found also interspersed some of the finest meadows in the world: some
                  places however were rocky, but these were comparatively few: the stone is sandy,
                  and might be used with advantage for building. When we returned to the boat, we
                  saw some smoke upon another part of the coast, and went thither in hopes of
                  meeting with the people, but at our approach, these also ran away. We found six
                  small canoes, and six fires very near the beach, with some muscles roasting upon
                  them, and a few oysters lying near: by this we judged that there had been one man
                  in each canoe, who having picked up some shell-fish were come ashore to eat it,
                  and that each had made his separate fire for that purpose; we tasted of their
                  cheer, and left them in return some strings of beads, and other things <pb n="502"/> which we thought would please them.* At the foot of a tree in this place we
                  found a small well of fresh water, supplied by a spring; and the day being now far
                  spent, we returned to the ship. In the evening, Mr. Banks made a little excursion
                  with his gun, and found such a number of quails, resembling those in England, that
                  he might have shot as many as he pleased; but his object was variety, and not
                  number. </p><p n="904">*The next morning, as the wind would not permit me to sail, I sent out
                  several parties into the country to try again whether some intercourse could not
                  be established with the natives. A midshipman who belonged to one of these
                  parties, having straggled a long way from his companions, met with a very old man
                  and woman, and some little children; they were sitting under a tree by the water
                  side, and neither party saw the other till they were close together: the Indians
                  showed signs of fear, but did not attempt to run away. The man happened to have
                  nothing to give them but a parrot that he had shot; this he offered, but they
                  refused to accept it, withdrawing themselves from his hand either through fear or
                  aversion. His stay with them was but short, for he saw several canoes near the
                  beach fishing, and being alone, he feared they might come ashore and attack him:
                  he said, that these people were very dark coloured, but not black; that the man
                  and woman appeared to be very old, being both grey-headed; that the hair of the
                  man's head was bushy, and his beard long and rough; that the woman's hair was
                  cropped short, and both of them were stark naked. Mr. Monkhouse the Surgeon, and
                  one of the men, who were with another party near the watering-place, also stayed
                  from their companions, and as they were coming out of a thicket observed six
                  Indians standing together, at the distance of about fifty yards. One of them
                  pronounced a word very <pb n="503"/> loud, which was supposed to be a signal,* for
                  a lance was immediately thrown at him out of the wood, which very narrowly missed
                  him. When the Indians saw that the weapon had not taken effect, they ran away with
                  the greatest precipitation; but on turning about towards the place whence the
                  lance had been thrown, he saw a young Indian, whom he judged to be about nineteen
                  or twenty years old, come down from a tree, and he also ran away with such speed
                  as made it hopeless to follow him. Mr. Monkhouse was of opinion that he had been
                  watched by these Indians in his passage through the thicket, and that the youth
                  had been stationed in the tree, to discharge the lance at him, upon a signal as he
                  should come by; but however this be, there could be no doubt but that he was the
                  person who threw the lance. </p><p n="905">In the afternoon, I went myself with a party over to the north shore, and
                  while some of our people were hauling the seine, we made an excursion a few miles
                  into the country, proceeding afterwards in the direction of the coast. We found
                  this place without wood, and somewhat resembling our moors in England; the surface
                  of the ground, however, was covered with a thin brush of plants, about as high as
                  the knees: the hills near the coast are low, but others rise behind them,
                  increasing by a gradual ascent to a considerable distance, with marshes and
                  morasses between. When we returned to the boat, we found that our people had
                  caught with the seine a great number of small fish, which are well known in the
                  West Indies, and which our sailors call Leather jackets, because their skin is
                  remarkably thick. I had sent the Second Lieutenant out in the yawl a striking, and
                  when we got back to the ship, we found that he also had been very successful. He
                  had observed that the large sting-rays, of <pb n="504"/> which there is great
                  plenty in the bay,* followed the flowing tide into very shallow water; he
                  therefore took the opportunity of flood, and struck several in not more than two
                  or three feet water: one of them weighed no less than two hundred and forty pounds
                  after his entrails were taken out. </p><p n="906">*The next morning, as the wind still continued northerly I sent out the
                  yawl again, and the people struck one still larger, for when his entrails were
                  taken out he weighed three hundred and thirty-six pounds. </p><p n="907">The great quantity of plants which Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander collected in
                  this place induced me to give it the name of BOTANY BAY. It is situated in the
                  latitude of <geo select="lat" n="102">34° S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="102">208° 37′ W</geo>. It is capacious,
                  safe, and convenient, and may be known by the land on the sea-coast, which is
                  nearly level, and of a moderate height; in general higher than it is farther
                  inland, with steep rocky cliffs next the sea, which have the appearance of a long
                  island lying close under the shore. The harbour lies about the middle of this
                  land, and in approaching it from the southward, is discovered before the ship
                  comes abreast of it; but from the northward it is not discovered so soon: the
                  entrance is a little more than a quarter of a mile broad, and lies in W.N.W. To
                  sail into it the southern shore should be kept on board, till the ship is within a
                  small bare island, which lies close under the north shore; within this island the
                  deepest water on that side is seven fathom, shallowing to five a good way up. At a
                  considerable distance from the south shore there is a shoal, reaching from the
                  inner south point quite to the head of the harbour; but over towards the north and
                  north west shore there is a channel of twelve or fourteen feet at low water, for
                  three or four leagues, up to a place where there is three or four fathom, but here
                  I found very little fresh water. We <pb n="505"/> anchored near the south shore,*
                  about a mile within the entrance, for the convenience of sailing with a southerly
                  wind, and because I thought it the best situation for watering; but I afterwards
                  found a very fine stream on the north shore, in the first sandy cove within the
                  island, before which a ship might lie almost land-locked, and procure wood as well
                  as water in great abundance. Wood indeed is every where plenty, but I saw only two
                  kinds which may be considered as timber. These trees are as large, or larger than
                  the English oak, and one of them has not a very different appearance: this is the
                  same that yields the reddish gum like sanguis draconis, and the wood is heavy,
                  hard, and dark-coloured, like lignum vitae: the other grows tall and strait,
                  something like the pine; and the wood of this, which has some resemblance to the
                  live oak of America, is also hard and heavy. There are a few shrubs, and several
                  kinds of the palm; mangroves also grow in great plenty near the head of the bay.
                  The country in general is level, low, and woody, as far as we could see. The
                  woods, as I have before observed, abound with birds of exquisite beauty,
                  particularly of the parrot kind; we found also crows here, exactly the same with
                  those in England. About the head of the harbour, where there are large flats of
                  sand and mud, there is great plenty of water-fowl, most of which were altogether
                  unknown to us: one of the most remarkable was black and white, much larger than a
                  swan, and in shape somewhat resembling a pelican. On these banks of sand and mud
                  there are great quantities of oysters, muscles, cockles, and other shell-fish,
                  which seem to be the principal subsistence of the inhabitants, who go into shoal
                  water with their little canoes, and pick them out with their hands. We did not
                  observe that they eat any of them raw, nor do they always go on shore to dress
                  them, for they have frequently fires in their canoes for that purpose. <pb n="506"/> They do not however subsist wholly upon this food,* for they catch a variety of
                  other fish, some of which they strike with gigs, and some they take with hook and
                  line. All the inhabitants that we saw were stark naked: they did not appear to be
                  numerous, nor to live in societies, but like other animals were scattered about
                  along the coast, and in the woods. Of their manner of life, however, we could know
                  but little, as we were never able to form the least connection with them: after
                  the first contest at our landing, they would never come near enough to parley; nor
                  did they touch a single article of all that we had left at their huts, and the
                  places they frequented, on purpose for them to take away. </p><p n="908">During my stay in this harbour, I caused the English colours to be
                  displayed on shore every day, and the ship's name, and the date of the year, to be
                  inscribed upon one of the trees near the watering-place. </p><p n="909">It is high-water here at the full and change of the moon about eight
                  o'clock, and the tide rises and falls perpendicularly between four and five feet. </p></div><pb n="507"/><div type="chapter" n="32"><head><l>CHAP.IV.</l><l><emph rend="italic"> The Range from Botany Bay to Trinity Bay; with a farther

                  with a light breeze at N. W. which soon after coming to the southward, we steered
                  along the shore N. N. E.; and at noon, our latitude, by observation, was <geo select="lat">33°
                     50′ S</geo>. At this time we were between two and three miles distant from the
                  land, and a-breast of a bay, or harbour, in which there appeared to be good
                  anchorage, and which I called PORT JACKSON. This harbour lies three leagues to the
                  northward of Botany Bay: the variation, by several azimuths, appeared to be
                     <geo select="lon">8° E</geo>. At sun-set, the northermost land in sight bore N. 26 E. and
                  some broken land, that seemed to form a bay, bore N. 40 W. distant four leagues.
                  This bay, which lies in latitude <geo select="lat">33° 42′</geo>, I called BROKEN BAY. We
                  steered along the shore N. N. E. all night, at the distance of about three leagues
                  from the land, having from thirty-two to thirty-six fathom water, with a hard

                     22′ S</geo>.: we were about three leagues from the shore; the northermost land
                  in sight bore N. 19 E. and some lands which projected in three bluff points, and
                  which, for that reason, I called CAPE THREE <pb n="508"/> POINTS,* bore S. W.
                  distant five leagues. Our longitude from Botany Bay was 19′ E. In the afternoon,
                  we saw smoke in several places upon the shore, and in the evening, found the
                  variation to be <geo select="lon">8° 25′ E</geo>. At this time we were between two and three
                  miles from the shore, in twenty-eight fathom; and at noon the next day,* we had
                  not advanced one step to the northward. We stood off shore, with the winds
                  northerly, till twelve at night, and at the distance of about five leagues, had
                  seventy fathom; at the distance of six leagues we had eighty fathom, which is the
                  extent of the soundings; for at the distance of ten leagues, we had no ground with
                  150 fathom. </p><p n="912">*The wind continuing northerly, till the morning of the <date>10th</date>, we continued
                  to stand in and off the shore, with very little change of situation in other
                  respects; but a gale then springing up at S. W. we made the best of our way along
                  the shore to the northward. At sun-rise, our latitude was <geo select="lat" n="103">33° 2′ S</geo>. and
                  the variation <geo select="lon" n="103">8° E</geo>. At nine in the forenoon, we passed a remarkable
                  hill, which stood a little way inland, and somewhat resembled the crown of a hat:
                  and at noon, our latitude, by observation, was <geo select="lat" n="104">32° 53′ S</geo>. and our
                  longitude <geo select="lon" n="104">208° W</geo>. We were about two leagues distant from the land,
                  which extended from N. 41 E. to S. 41 W., and a small round rock, or island, which
                  lay close under the land, bore S. 82 W. distant between three and four leagues. At
                  four in the afternoon, we passed, at the distance of about a mile, a low rocky
                  point, which I called POINT STEPHENS, on the north side of which is an inlet,
                  which I called PORT STEPHENS: this inlet appeared to me, from the mast head, to be
                  sheltered from all winds. It lies in latitude <geo select="lat" n="105">32° 40′</geo>, longitude
                  <geo select="lon" n="105">207° 51′</geo>, and at the entrance are three small islands, two of which
                  are high; and on the main near the shore are some high round hills, which at a
                  distance appear like islands. In <pb n="509"/> passing this bay,* at the distance
                  of two or three miles from the shore, our soundings were from thirty-three to
                  twenty-seven fathom, from which I conjectured that there must be a sufficient
                  depth of water within it. At a little distance within land, we saw smoke in
                  several places; and at half an hour past five, the northermost land in sight bore
                  N. 36 E. and Point Stephens S. W. distant four leagues. Our soundings in the
                  night, were from forty-eight to sixty-two fathom, at the distance of between three
                  and four leagues from the shore, which made in two hillocks. This Point I called
                  CAPE HAWKE: it lies in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="106">32° 14′ S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="106">207°
                     30′ W</geo>.;* and at four o'clock in the morning bore W. distant about eight
                  miles; at the same time the northermost land in sight bore N. 6 E. and appeared
                  like an island. At noon, this land bore N. 8 E. the northermost land in sight N.
                  13 E. and Cape Hawke S. 37 W. Our latitude, by observation, was <geo select="lat">32° 2′
                     S</geo>. which was twelve miles to the southward of that given by the log; so
                  that probably we had a current setting that way: by the morning amplitude and
                  azimuth, the variation was <geo select="lon">9° 10′ E</geo>. During our run along the shore, in
                  the afternoon, we saw smoke in several places, at a little distance from the
                  beach, and one upon the top of a hill, which was the first we had seen upon
                  elevated ground since our arrival upon the coast. At sun-set, we had twenty-three
                  fathom, at the distance of a league and an half from the shore: the northermost
                  land then bore N. 13 E. and three hills, remarkably large and high, lying
                  contiguous to each other, and not far from the beach, N. N. W. As these hills bore
                  some resemblance to each other, we called them the THREE BROTHERS. They lie in
                  latitude <geo select="lat">31° 40′</geo>, and may be seen fourteen or sixteen leagues. We
                  steered N. E. by N. all night, having from twenty-seven to sixty-seven fathom, at
                  the distance of between two and six leagues from the shore. </p><p n="913"><pb n="510"/>*At day-break, we steered north, for the northermost land in sight.
                  At noon, we were four leagues from the shore, and by observation, in latitude
                  <geo select="lat" n="107">31° 18′ S</geo>., which was fifteen miles to the southward of that given
                  by the log; our longitude <geo select="lon" n="107">206° 58′ W</geo>. In the afternoon, we stood in for
                  the land, where we saw smoke in several places, till six in the evening, when,
                  being within three or four miles of it, and in twenty-four fathom of water, we
                  stood off with a fresh breeze at N. and N. N. W. till midnight, when we had 118
                  fathom, at the distance of eight leagues from the land, and then tacked.* At three
                  in the morning, the wind veered to the westward, when we tacked and stood to the
                  northward. At noon, our latitude, by observation, was <geo select="lat" n="108">30° 43′ S</geo>., and
                  our longitude <geo select="lon" n="108">206° 45′ W</geo>. At this time we were between three and four
                  leagues from the shore, the northermost part of which bore from us N. 13 W. and a
                  point, or head land, on which we saw fires that produced a great quantity of
                  smoke, bore W. distant four leagues. To this Point I gave the name of SMOKEY CAPE:
                  it is of a condsierable height, and over the pitch of the Point is a round
                  hillock; within it are two others, much higher and larger, and within them the
                  land is very low. Our latitude was <geo select="lat" n="109">30° 31′ S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="109">206° 54′
                     W</geo>.: this day the observed latitude was only five miles south of the log.
                  We saw smoke in several parts along the coast, besides that seen upon Smokey Cape. </p><p n="914">In the afternoon, the wind being at N. E. we stood off and on, and at
                  three or four miles distance from the shore had thirty fathom water: the wind
                  afterwards coming cross off land, we stood to the northward, having from thirty to
                  twenty-one fathom, at the distance of four or five miles from the shore. </p><p n="915">*At five in the morning, the wind veered to the north, and blew fresh,
                  attended with squalls: at eight, it began to thunder <pb n="511"/> and rain, and
                  in about an hour it fell calm,* which gave us an opportunity to sound, and we had
                  eighty-six fathom at between four and five leagues from the shore: soon after this
                  we had a gale from the southward, with which we steered N. by W. for the
                  northermost land in sight. At noon, we were about four leagues from the shore, and
                  by observation, in latitude <geo select="lat" n="110">30° 22′</geo>, which was nine miles to the
                  southward of our reckoning, longitude <geo select="lon" n="110">206° 39′ W</geo>. Some lands near the
                  shore, of a considerable height, bore W. </p><p n="916">As we advanced to the northward, from Botany Bay, the land gradually
                  increased in height, so that in this latitude it may be called a hilly country.
                  Between this latitude and the Bay, it exhibits a pleasing variety of ridges,
                  hills, vallies, and plains, all clothed with wood, of the same appearance with
                  that which has been particularly described: the land near the shore is in general
                  low and sandy, except the points, which are rocky, and over many of them are high
                  hills, which, at their first rising out of the water, have the appearance of
                  islands. In the afternoon, we had some small rocky islands between us and the
                  land, the southermost of which lies in latitude <geo select="lat">30° 10′</geo>, and the
                  northermost in <geo select="lat">29° 58′</geo>, and somewhat more than two leagues from the
                  land: about two miles without the northermost island we had thirty-three fathom
                  water, Having the advantage of a moon, we steered along the shore all night, in
                  the direction of N. and N. by E. keeping at the distance of about three leagues
                  from the land, and having from twenty to twenty-five fathom water. As soon as it
                  was light, having a fresh gale, we made all the fail we could, and at nine o'clock
                  in the morning,* being about a league from the shore, we discovered smoke in many
                  places, and having recourse to our glasses, we saw about twenty of the natives,
                  who had each a large bundle <pb n="512"/> upon his back,* which we conjectured to
                  be palm leaves for covering their houses: we continued to observe them above an
                  hour, during which they walked upon the beach, and up a path that led over a hill
                  of a gentle ascent, behind which we lost sight of them: not one of them was
                  observed to stop and look towards us, but they trudged along, to all appearance,
                  without the least emotion either of curiosity or surprize, though it is impossible
                  they should not have seen the ship by a casual glance as they walked along the
                  shore; and though she must, with respect to every other object they had yet seen,
                  have been little less stupendous and unaccountable than a floating mountain with
                  all its woods would have been to us. At noon, our latitude, by observation, was
                  <geo select="lat" n="111">28° 39′ S</geo>., and longitude <geo select="lon" n="111">206° 27′W</geo>. A high point of
                  land, which I named CAPE BYRON, bore N. W. by W. at the distance of three miles.
                  It lies in latitude <geo select="lat" n="112">28° 37′ 30″ S.</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon" n="112">206° 30′ W</geo>.
                  and may be known by a remarkable sharp peaked mountain, which lies inland, and
                  bears from it N. W. by W. From this point, the land trends N. 13 W.: inland it is
                  high and hilly, but low near the shore; to the southward of the point it is also
                  low and level. We continued to steer along the shore with a fresh gale, till
                  sun-set, when we suddenly discovered breakers a-head, directly in the ship's
                  course, and also on our larboard bow. At this time we were about five miles from
                  the land, and had twenty fathom water: we hauled up east till eight, when we had
                  run eight miles, and increased our depth of water to forty-four fathom: we then
                  brought to, with the ship's head to the eastward, and lay upon this tack till ten,
                  when, having increased our sounding to seventy-eight fathom, we wore, and lay with
                  the ship's head to the land till five in the morning,* when we made sail, and at
                  daylight, were greatly surprized to find ourselves farther to the southward, than
                  we had been the evening before, <pb n="513"/> though the wind had been southerly,*
                  and blown fresh all night: we now saw the breakers again within us, and passed
                  them at the distance of one league. They lie in latitude <geo select="lat">28° 8′ S</geo>.
                  stretching off east two leagues from a point of land, under which is a small
                  island. Their situation may always be known by the peaked mountain which has been
                  just mentioned, and which bears from them S. W. by W. for this reason I have named
                  it MOUNT WARNING. It lies seven or eight leagues inland, in latitude <geo select="lat">28° 22′
                     S</geo>. The land about it is high and hilly, but it is of itself sufficiently
                  conspicuous to be at once distinguished from every other object. The Point off
                  which these shoals lie, I have named POINT DANGER. To the northward of this Point
                  the land is low, and trends N. W. by N.; but it soon turns again more to the
                  northward. </p><p n="917">At noon, we were about two leagues from the land, and by observation, in
                  latitude <geo select="lat" n="113">27° 46′ S</geo>. which was seventeen miles to the southward of the
                  log; our longitude was <geo select="lon" n="113">206° 20′ W</geo>. Mount Warning bore S. 26 W. distant
                  fourteen leagues, and the northermost land in sight bore N. We pursued our course
                  along the shore, at the distance of about two leagues, in the direction of N. ¾ E.
                  till between four and five in the afternoon, when we discovered breakers on our
                  larboard bow. Our depth of water was thirty-seven fathom, and at sun-set, the
                  northermost land bore N. by W. the breakers N. W. by W. distant four miles, and
                  the northermost land set at noon, which formed a point, and to which I gave the
                  name of POINT LOOK-OUT, W. distant five or six miles, in the latitude of <geo select="lat">27°
                     6′</geo>. On the north side of this Point, the shore forms a wide open bay,
                  which I called MORETON's BAY, in the bottom of which the land is so low that I
                  could but just see it from the top-mast head. The breakers lie between three and
                  four miles from Point Look-out; and at this <pb n="514"/> time we had a great sea
                  from the southward,* which broke upon them very high. We stood on N. N. E. till
                  eight o'clock, when having passed the breakers, and deepened our water to
                  fifty-two fathom, we brought to till midnight, when made sail again to the N. N.
                  E.* At four in the morning, we had 135 fathom, and when the day broke, I perceived
                  that during the night I had got much farther northward, and from the shore, than I
                  expected from the course we steered, for we were distant at least seven leagues; I
                  therefore hauled in N. W. by W. with a fresh gale at S. S. W. The land that was
                  farthest to the north the night before, now bore S. S. W. distant six leagues, and
                  I gave it the name of CAPE MORETON, it being the north point of Moreton's Bay: its
                  latitude is <geo select="lat" n="114">26° 56′</geo>, and its longitude is <geo select="lon" n="114">206° 28′</geo>. From
                  Cape Moreton the land trends away west, farther than can be seen, for there is a
                  small space, where at this time no land is visible, and some on board having also
                  observed that the sea looked paler than usual, were of opinion that the bottom of
                  Moreton's Bay opened into a river: we had here thirty-four fathom water, and a
                  fine sandy bottom: this alone would have produced the change that had been
                  observed in the colour of the water; and it was by no means necessary to suppose a
                  river to account for the land at the bottom of the Bay not being visible, for
                  supposing the land there to be as low as we knew it to be in a hundred other parts
                  of the coast, it would have been impossible to see it from the station of the
                  ship; however, if any future navigator should be disposed to determine the
                  question, whether there is or is not a river in this place, which the wind would
                  not permit us to do, the situation may always be found by three hills which lie to
                  the northward of it, in the latitude of <geo select="lat">26° 53′</geo>. These hills lie but a
                  little way inland, and not far from each other: they are remarkable for the
                  singular form of their elevation, <pb n="515"/> which very much resembles a
                  glass-house,* and for which reason I called them the GLASS HOUSES: the northermost
                  of the three is the highest and largest: there are also several other peaked hills
                  inland to the northward of these, but they are not nearly so remarkable. At noon,
                  our latitude was, by observation, <geo select="lat" n="115">26° 28′ S</geo>. which was ten miles to the
                  northward of the log, a circumstance which had never before happened upon this
                  coast; our longitude was <geo select="lon" n="115">206° 46′</geo>. At this time we were between two and
                  three leagues from the land, and had twenty-four fathom water. A low bluff point,
                  which was the south head of a sandy bay, bore N. 62 W. distant three leagues, and
                  the northermost point of land in sight bore N. ¼ E. This day we saw smoke in
                  several places, and some at a considerable distance inland. </p><p n="918">In steering along the shore at the distance of two leagues, our soundings
                  were from twenty-four to thirty-two fathom, with a sandy bottom. At six in the
                  evening, the northermost point of land bore N. ¼ W. distant four leagues; at ten
                  it bore N. W. by W. ½ W. and as we had seen no land to the northward of it, we
                  brought to, not well knowing which way to steer. </p><p n="919">At two in the morning, however,* we made sail with the wind at S. W. and
                  at daylight, we saw the land extending as far as N. ¼ E. the point we had set the
                  night before bore S. W. by W. distant between three and four leagues. It lies in
                  latitude <geo select="lat" n="116">25° 58′</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon" n="116">206° 48′ W</geo>.: the land within it
                  is of a moderate and equal height, but the point itself is so unequal, that it
                  looks like two small islands lying under the land, for which reason I gave it the
                  name of DOUBLE ISLAND POINT; it may also be known by the white cliffs on the north
                  side of it. Here the land trends to the N. W. and forms a large open bay, the
                  bottom of which is so low a flat that <pb n="516"/> from the deck it could
                  scarcely be seen.* In crossing this bay, our depth of water was from thirty to
                  twenty-two fathom, with a white sandy bottom. At noon, we were about three leagues
                  from the shore, in latitude <geo select="lat" n="117">25° 34′ S</geo>. longitude <geo select="lon" n="117">206° 45′
                  W</geo>.: Double Island Point bore S. ¾ W. and the northermost land in sight N. ¾
                  E. This part of the coast, which is of a moderate height, is more barren than any
                  we had seen, and the soil more sandy. With our glasses we could discover that the
                  sands, which lay in great patches of many acres, were moveable, and that some of
                  them had not been long in the place they possessed; for we saw in several parts,
                  trees half buried, the tops of which were still green; and in others, the naked
                  trunks of such as the sand had surrounded long enough to destroy. In other places
                  the woods appeared to be low and shrubby, and we saw no signs of inhabitants. Two
                  water snakes swam by the ship: they were beautifully spotted, and in every respect
                  like land snakes, except that their tails were broad and flat, probably to serve
                  them instead of fins in swimming. In the morning of this day, the variation was
                     <geo select="lon">8° 20′ E</geo>. and in the evening, <geo select="lon">8° 36′</geo>. During the night,
                  we continued our course to the northward, with a light breeze from the land, being
                  distant from it between two and three leagues, and having from twenty-three to
                  twenty-seven fathom with a fine sandy bottom. </p><p n="920">*At noon on the <date>19th</date>, we were about four miles from the land, with only
                  thirteen fathom. Our latitude was <geo select="lat">25° 4′</geo>, and the northermost land in
                  sight bore N. 21 W. distant eight miles. At one o'clock, being still four miles
                  distant from the shore, but having seventeen fathom water, we passed a black bluff
                  head, or point of land, upon which a great number of the natives were assembled,
                  and which therefore I called INDIAN HEAD: it lies in latitude <geo select="lat">25° 3′</geo>.
                  About four miles N. by W. of this Head, is another very like it from <pb n="517"/>
                  whence the land trends away somewhat more to the westward: next to the sea it is
                  low and sandy,* and behind it nothing was to be seen, even from the mast-head.
                  Near Indian Head we saw more of the natives, and upon the neighbouring shore fires
                  by night, and smoke by day. We kept to the northward all night, at the distance of
                  from four miles to four leagues from the shore, and with a depth of water from
                  seventeen to thirty-four fathom. At day-break,* the northermost land bore from us
                  W. S. W. and seemed to end in a point, from which we discovered a reef running out
                  to the northward as far as we could see. We had hauled our wind to the westward
                  before it was light, and continued the course till we saw the breakers upon our
                  see bow. We now edged away N. W. and N. N. W. along the east side of the shoal,
                  from two to one mile distant, having regular soundings from thirteen to seven
                  fathom, with a fine sandy bottom. At noon, our latitude, by observation, was
                  <geo select="lat">20° 26′</geo>, which was thirteen miles to the northward of the log: we
                  judged the extream point of the shoal to bear from us about N. W. and the point
                  from which it seemed to run out, bore S. ¾ W. distant twenty miles. This point I
                  named SANDY CAPE, from two very large patches of white sand which lay upon it. It
                  is sufficiently high to be seen at the distance of twelve leagues, in clear
                  weather, and lies in latitude <geo select="lat" n="118">24° 45′</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon" n="118">206° 51′</geo>:
                  the land trends from it S. W. as far as can be seen. We kept along the east side
                  of the shoal till two in the afternoon, when, judging that there was a sufficient
                  depth of water upon it to allow passage for the ship, I sent the boat a-head to
                  sound, and upon her making the signal for more than five fathom, we hauled our
                  wind, and stood over the tail of it in six fathom. At this time we were in
                  latitude <geo select="lat">24° 22′</geo>, and Sandy Cape bore S. ½ E. distant eight leagues;
                  but the direction of the shoal is nearest N. N. W. <pb n="518"/> and S. S. E.* It
                  is remarkable that when on board the ship we had six fathom, the boat, which was
                  scarcely a quarter of a mile to the southward, had little more than five, and that
                  immediately after six fathom we had thirteen, and then twenty, as fast as the man
                  could cast the lead: from these circumstances, I conjectured that the west side of
                  the shoal was steep. This shoal I called the BREAK SEA SPIT, because we had now
                  smooth water, and to the southward of it we had always a high sea from the S. E.
                  At six in the evening, the land of Sandy Cape extended from S. 17 E. to S. 27 E.
                  at the distance of eight leagues; our depth of water was twenty-three fathom: with
                  the same soundings we stood to the westward all night.* At seven in the morning,
                  we saw, from the mast-head, the land of Sandy Cape bearing S. E. ½ E. distant
                  about thirteen leagues: at nine, we discovered land to the westward, and soon
                  after saw smoke in several places. Our depth of water was now decreased to
                  seventeen fathom, and by noon we had no more than thirteen, though we were seven
                  leagues from the land, which extended from S. by W. to W. N. W. Our latitude at
                  this time was <geo select="lat">24° 28′S</geo>. For a few days past we had seen several of the
                  sea birds called boobies, not having met with any of them before; last night a
                  small flock of them passed the ship, and went away to the N. W. and in the
                  morning, from about half an hour before sun-rise, to half an hour after, flights
                  of them were continually coming from the N. N. W. and flying to the S. S. E. nor
                  was one of them seen to fly in any other direction; we therefore conjectured that
                  there was a lagoon, river, or inlet of shallow water, in the bottom of the deep
                  bay, to the southward of us, whither these birds resorted to feed in the day, and
                  that not far to the northward there were some islands to which they repaired in
                  the night. To this bay I gave the name of HERVEY's BAY, in honour of Captain
                  Hervey. <pb n="519"/> In the afternoon, we stood in for the land,* steering S. W.
                  with a gentle breeze at S. E. till four o'clock, when, being in latitude <geo select="lat">24°
                     36′</geo>, about two leagues from the shore, and having nine fathom water, we
                  bore away along the coast N. W. by W. and at the same time could see land
                  extending to the S. S. E. about eight leagues. Near the sea the land is very low,
                  but within there are some lofty hills, all thickly clothed with wood. While we
                  were running along the shore, we shallowed our water from nine to seven fathom,
                  and at one time we had but six, which determined us to anchor for the night. </p><p n="921">At six in the morning we weighed,* with a gentle breeze from the
                  southward, and steered N. W. ¼ W. edging in for the land till we got within two
                  miles of it, with water from seven to eleven fathom: we then steered N. N. W. as
                  the land lay, and at noon, our latitude was <geo select="lat">24° 19′</geo>. We continued in
                  the same course, at the same distance, with from twelve fathom to seven, till five
                  in the evening, when we were abreast of the south point of a large open bay, in
                  which I intended to anchor. During this course, we discovered with our glasses
                  that the land was covered with palm-nut-trees, which we had not seen from the time
                  of our leaving the islands within the Tropick: we also saw two men walking along
                  the shore, who did not condescend to take the least notice of us. In the evening,
                  having hauled close upon a wind, and made two or three trips, we anchored about
                  eight o'clock in five fathom, with a fine sandy bottom. The south point of the bay
                  bore E. ¾ S. distant two miles, the north point N. W. ¼ N. and about the same
                  distance from the shore. </p><p n="922">Early the next morning I went ashore,* with a party of men, in order to
                  examine the country, accompanied by Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, the other gentlemen,
                  and Tupia: the <pb n="520"/> wind blew fresh,* and we found it so cold, that being
                  at some distance from the shore, we took our cloaks as a necessary equipment for
                  the voyage. We landed a little within the south point of the bay, where we found a
                  channel leading into a large lagoon: this channel I proceeded to examine, and
                  found three fathom water till I got about a mile up it, where I met with a shoal,
                  upon which there was little more than one fathom, but having passed over it, I had
                  three fathom again. The entrance of this channel lies close to the south point of
                  the bay, being formed by the shore on the east, and on the west by a large spit of
                  sand: it is about a quarter of a mile broad, and lies in S. by W. In this place
                  there is room for a few ships to lie in great security, and a small stream of
                  fresh water; I would have rowed into the lagoon, but was prevented by shallows. We
                  found several bogs, and swamps of salt water, upon which, and by the sides of the
                  lagoon, grows the true mangrove, such as is found in the West Indies, and the
                  first of the kind that we had met with. In the branches of these mangroves there
                  were many nests of a remarkable kind of ant, that was as green as grass: when the
                  branches were disturbed they came out in great numbers, and punished the offender
                  by a much sharper bite than ever we had felt from the same kind of animal before.
                  Upon these mangroves also we saw small green caterpillars in great numbers: their
                  bodies were thick set with hairs, and they were ranged upon the leaves side by
                  side like a file of soldiers, to the number of twenty or thirty together: when we
                  touched them, we found that the hair on their bodies had the quality of a nettle,
                  and gave us a much more acute, though less durable pain. The country here is
                  manifestly worse than about Botany Bay: the soil is dry and sandy, but the sides
                  of the hills are covered with trees, which grow separately, without underwood. We
                     <pb n="521"/> found here the tree that yields a gum like the Sanguis draconis;*
                  but it is somewhat different from the trees of the same kind which we had seen
                  before, for the leaves are longer, and hang down like those of the weeping willow.
                  We found also much less gum upon them, which is contrary to the established
                  opinion, that the hotter the climate, the more gums exude. Upon a plant also,
                  which yielded a yellow gum, there was less than upon the same kind of plant in
                  Botany Bay. Among the shoals and sand-banks we saw many large birds, some in
                  particular of the same kind that we had seen in Botany Bay, much bigger than
                  swans, which we judged to be pelicans; but they were so shy that we could not get
                  within gun-shot of them. Upon the shore we saw a species of the bustard, one of
                  which we shot, it was as large as a turkey, and weighed seventeen pounds and an
                  half. We all agreed that this was the best bird we had eaten since we left
                  England; and in honour of it we called this inlet BUSTARD BAY. It lies in latitude
                  <geo select="lat" n="119">24° 4′</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon" n="119">208° 18′</geo>. The sea seemed to abound with
                  fish; but, unhappily, we tore our seine all to pieces at the first haul: upon the
                  mud-banks, under the mangroves, we found innumerable oysters of various kinds;
                  among others the hammer-oyster, and a large proportion of small pearl-oysters: if
                  in deeper water there is equal plenty of such oysters at their full growth, a
                  pearl fishery might certainly be established here to very great advantage. </p><p n="923">The people who were left on board the ship said, that while we were in the
                  woods about twenty of the natives came down to the beach, abreast of her, and
                  having looked at her sometime, went away; but we that were ashore, though we saw
                  smoke in many places, saw no people: the smoke was at places too distant for us to
                  get to them by land, except one, <pb n="522"/> to which we repaired:* we found ten
                  small fires still burning within a few paces of each other; but the people were
                  gone: we saw near them several vessels of bark, which we supposed to have
                  contained water, and some shells and fish-bones, the remains of a recent meal. We
                  saw also, lying upon the ground, several pieces of soft bark, about the length and
                  breadth of a man, which we imagined might be their beds; and, on the windward side
                  of the fires, a small shade, about a foot and a half high, of the same substance.
                  The whole was in a thicket of close trees, which afforded good shelter from the
                  wind. The place seemed to be much trodden, and as we saw no house, nor any remains
                  of a house, we were inclined to believe that as these people had no clothes, they
                  had no dwelling; but spent their nights, among the other commoners of Nature, in
                  the open air: and Tupia himself, with an air of superiority and compassion, shook
                  his head, and said that they were Taata Enos, 'poor wretches.' I measured the
                  perpendicular height of the last tide, and found it to be eight feet above
                  low-water mark, and from the time of low-water this day, I found that it must be
                  high-water at the full and change of the moon at eight o'clock. </p><p n="924">*At four o'clock in the morning we weighed, and with a gentle breeze at
                  south made sail out of the bay. In standing out our soundings were from five to
                  fifteen fathom; and at day-light, when we were in the greatest depth, and abreast
                  of the north head of the bay, we discovered breakers stretching out from it N.N.E.
                  between two and three miles, with a rock at the outermost point of them, just
                  above water. While we were passing these rocks, at the distance of about half a
                  mile, we had from fifteen to twenty fathom, and as soon as we had passed them, we
                  hauled along shore W.N.W. for the farthest land we had in sight. At noon, our
                  latitude by <pb n="523"/> observation was <geo select="lat" n="120">23° 52′ S</geo>.;* the north part
                  of Bustard Bay bore S. 62 E. distant ten miles; and the northermost land in sight
                  N. 60 W.; the longitude was <geo select="lon" n="120">208° 37′</geo>, and our distance from the nearest
                  shore six miles, with fourteen fathom water. </p><p n="925">Till five in the afternoon it was calm, but afterwards we steered before
                  the wind N. W. as the land lay till ten at night, and then brought to, having had
                  all along fourteen and fifteen fathom. At five in the morning we made sail;* and
                  at day-light the northermost point of the main bore N. 70 W. Soon after we saw
                  more land, making like islands, and bearing N. W. by N. At nine, we were abreast
                  of the point, at the distance of one mile, with fourteen fathom water. This point
                  I found to lie directly under the Tropic of Capricorn; and for that reason I
                  called it CAPE CAPRICORN: its longitude is <geo select="lon">208° 58′ W</geo>.: it is of a
                  considerable height, looks white and barren, and may be known by some islands
                  which lie to the N. W. of it, and some small rocks at the distance of about a
                  league S. E. On the west side of the Cape there appeared to be a lagoon, and on
                  the two spits which formed the entrance we saw an incredible number of the large
                  birds that resemble a pelican. The northermost land now in sight bore from Cape
                  Capricorn N. 24 W. and appeared to be an island; but the main land trended W. by
                  N. ½ N. which course we steered, having from fifteen to six fathom, and from six
                  to nine, with a hard sandy bottom. At noon, our latitude by observation was
                  <geo select="lat">23° 24′ S</geo>.; Cape Capricorn bore S. 60 E. distant two leagues; and a
                  small island N. by E. two miles: in this situation we had nine fathom, being about
                  four miles from the main, which, next the sea, is low and sandy, except the points
                  which are high and rocky. The country inland is hilly, but by no means of a
                  pleasing aspect. We continued to stand to the N. W. till four o'clock in the
                  afternoon, when it fell <pb n="524"/> calm;* and we soon after anchored in twelve
                  fathom, having the main land and islands in a manner all round us, and Cape
                  Capricorn bearing S. 54 E. distant four leagues. In the night, we found the tide
                  rise and fall near seven feet; and the flood to set to the westward, and the ebb
                  to the eastward, which is just contrary to what we found when we were at anchor to
                  the eastward of Bustard Bay. </p><p n="926">*At six in the morning we weighed, with a gentle breeze at South, and
                  stood away to the N. W. between the outermost range of islands and the main,
                  leaving several small islands between the main and the ship, which we passed at a
                  very little distance: our soundings being irregular, from twelve to four fathom, I
                  sent a boat ahead to sound. At noon we were about three miles from the main, and
                  about the same distance from the islands without us: our latitude by observation
                  was <geo select="lat">23° 7′ S</geo>.: the main land here is high and mountainous; the islands
                  which lie off it are also most of them high, and of a small circuit, having an
                  appearance rather of barrenness than fertility. At this time we saw smoke in many
                  places at a considerable distance inland, and therefore conjectured that there
                  might be a lagoon, river, or inlet running up the country, the rather as we had
                  passed two places which had the appearance of being such; but our depth of water
                  was too little to encourage me to venture where I should probably have less. We
                  had not stood to the northward above an hour, before we suddenly fell into three
                  fathom; upon which I anchored, and sent away the Master to found the channel which
                  lay to leeward of us, between the northermost island and the main: it appeared to
                  be pretty broad, but I suspected that it was shallow, and so indeed it was found;
                  for the master reported at his return that in many places he had only two fathom
                  and an <pb n="525"/> half, and where we lay at anchor we had only sixteen feet,*
                  which was not two feet more than the ship drew. While the master was sounding the
                  channel, Mr. Banks tried to fish from the cabbin windows with hook and line: the
                  water was too shallow for fish; but the ground was almost covered with crabs,
                  which readily took the bait, and sometimes held it so fast in their claws, that
                  they did not quit their hold till they were considerably above water. These crabs
                  were of two sorts, and both of them such as we had not seen before: one of them
                  was adorned with the finest blue that can be imagined, in every respect equal to
                  the ultramarine, with which all his claws, and every joint was deeply tinged: the
                  under part of him was white, and so exquisitely polished that in colour and
                  brightness it exactly resembled the white of old china: the other was also marked
                  with the ultramarine upon his joints, and his toes, but somewhat more sparingly;
                  and his back was marked with three brown spots which had a singular appearance.
                  The people who had been out with the boat to sound, reported, that upon an island
                  where we had observed two fires, they had seen several of the inhabitants, who
                  called to them, and seemed very desirous that they should land. In the evening,
                  the wind veered to E. N. E. which gave us an opportunity to stretch three or four
                  miles back by the way we came; after which, the wind shifted to the South, and
                  obliged us again to anchor in six fathom. </p><p n="927">At five in the morning,* I sent away the Master to search for a passage
                  between the islands, while we got the ship under sail; and as soon as it was light
                  we followed the boat, which made a signal that a passage had been found. As soon
                  as we got again into deep water, we made sail to the northward, as the land lay,
                  with soundings from nine fathom to fifteen, and some small islands still without
                  us. At noon we were <pb n="526"/> about two leagues distant from the main;* and by
                  observation in latitude <geo select="lat">22° 53′ S</geo>. The northermost point of land in
                  sight now bore N. N. W. distant ten miles. To this point I gave the name of CAPE
                  MANIFOLD, from the number of high hills which appeared over it: it lies in
                  latitude <geo select="lat">22° 43′ S</geo>. and distant about seventeen leagues from Cape
                  Capricorn, in the direction of N. 26 W. Between these Capes the shore forms a
                  large bay, which I called KEPPEL BAY; and I also distinguished the islands by the
                  name of KEPPEL's ISLANDS. In this bay there is good anchorage; but what
                  refreshments it may afford, I know not: we caught no fish, though we were at
                  anchor; but probably there is fresh water in several places, as both the islands
                  and the main are inhabited. We saw smoke and fires upon the main; and upon the
                  islands we saw people. At three in the afternoon, we passed Cape Manifold, from
                  which the lands trends N. N. W. The land of the Cape is high, rising in hills
                  directly from the sea; and may be known by three islands which lie off it, one of
                  them near the shore, and the other two eight miles out at sea. One of these
                  islands is low and flat, and the other high and round. At six o'clock in the
                  evening we brought to, when the northermost part of the main in sight bore N. W.
                  and some islands which lie off it N. 31 W. Our soundings after twelve o'clock were
                  from twenty to twenty-five fathom, and in the night from thirty to thirty-four. </p><p n="928">*At day-break we made sail, Cape Manifold bearing S. by E. distant eight
                  leagues, and the islands which I had set the night before were distant four miles
                  in the same direction. The farthest visible point of the main bore N. 67 W. at the
                  distance of twenty-two miles; but we could see several islands to the northward of
                  this direction. At nine o'clock in the forenoon, we were abreast of the point
                  which I called <pb n="527"/> CAPE TOWNSHEND. It lies in latitude <geo select="lat" n="121">22°
                     15′</geo>;* longitude <geo select="lon" n="121">209° 43′</geo>: the land is high and level, and
                  rather naked than woody. Several islands lie to the northward of it, at the
                  distance of four or five miles out at sea; three or four leagues to the S. E. the
                  shore forms a bay, in the bottom of which there appeared to be an inlet or
                  harbour. To the westward of the Cape the land trends S. W. ½ S. and there forms a
                  very large bay which turns to the eastward, and probably communicates with the
                  inlet, and makes the land of the Cape an island. As soon as we got round this
                  Cape, we hauled our wind to the westward, in order to get within the islands,
                  which lie scattered in the bay in great numbers, and extend out to sea as far as
                  the eye could reach even from the mast-head: these islands vary both in height and
                  circuit from each other; so that, although they are very numerous, no two of them
                  are alike. We had not stood long upon a wind before we came into shoal water, and
                  were obliged to tack at once to avoid it. Having sent a boat ahead, I bore away W.
                  by N. many small islands, rocks, and shoals, lying between us and the main, and
                  many of a larger extent without us: our soundings till near noon were from
                  fourteen to seventeen fathom, when the boat made the signal for meeting with shoal
                  water: upon this we hauled close upon a wind to the eastward, but suddenly fell
                  into three fathom and a quarter; we immediately dropped an anchor, which brought
                  the ship up with all her sails standing. When the ship was brought up we had four
                  fathom, with a coarse sandy bottom, and found a strong tide setting to the N. W.
                  by W. ½ W. at the rate of near three miles an hour, by which we were so suddenly
                  carried upon the shoal. Our latitude by observation was <geo select="lat">22° 8′ S</geo>.; Cape
                  Townshend bore E. 16 S. distant thirteen miles; and the westermost part of <pb n="528"/> the main in sight W. ¾ N.* At this time a great number of islands lay
                  all round us. </p><p n="929">In the afternoon, having sounded round the ship, and found that there was
                  water sufficient to carry her over the shoal, we weighed, and about three o'clock
                  made sail and stood to the westward, as the land lay, having sent a boat ahead to
                  sound. At six in the evening, we anchored in ten fathom, with a sandy bottom, at
                  about two miles distance from the main; the westermost part of which bore W. N. W.
                  and a great number of islands, lying a long way without us, were still in sight. </p><p n="930">*At five o'clock the next morning, I sent away the Master with two boats
                  to sound the entrance of an inlet which bore from us west, at about the distance
                  of a league, into which I intended to go with the ship, that I might wait a few
                  days till the moon should encrease, and in the mean time examine the country. As
                  soon as the ship could be got under sail, the boats made the signal for anchorage;
                  upon which we stood in, and anchored in five fathom water, about a league within
                  the entrance of the inlet; which, as I observed a tide to flow and ebb
                  considerably, I judged to be a river that ran up the country to a considerable
                  distance. In this place I had thoughts of laying the ship ashore, and cleaning her
                  bottom; I therefore landed with the Master in search of a convenient place for
                  that purpose, and was accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander. We found walking
                  here exceedingly troublesome, for the ground was covered with a kind of grass, the
                  seeds of which were very sharp and bearded backwards; so that whenever they stuck
                  into our clothes, which indeed was at every step, they worked forwards by means of
                  the beard, till they got at the flesh; and at the same time we were surrounded by
                  a cloud of musquitos, which incessantly tormented <pb n="529"/> us with their
                  stings.* We soon met with several places where the ship might conveniently be laid
                  ashore; but to our great disappointment we could find no fresh water. We proceeded
                  however up the country, where we found gum trees like those that we had seen
                  before, and observed that here also the gum was in very small quantities. Upon the
                  branches of these trees, and some others, we found ants nests, made of clay, as
                  big as a bushel, something like those described in Sir Hans Sloan's Natural
                  History of Jamaica, vol. ii. p. 221, tab. 258, but not so smooth: the ants which
                  inhabited these nests were small, and their bodies white. But upon another species
                  of the tree we found a small black ant, which perforated all the twigs, and having
                  worked out the pith, occupied the pipe which had contained it; yet the parts in
                  which these insects had thus formed a lodgment, and in which they swarmed in
                  amazing numbers, bore leaves and flowers, and appeared to be in as flourishing a
                  state as those that were sound. We found also an incredible number of butterflies,
                  so that for the space of three or four acres the air was so crowded with them that
                  millions were to be seen in every direction, at the same time that every branch
                  and twig was covered with others that were not upon the wing. We found here also a
                  small fish of a singular kind; it was about the size of a minnow, and had two very
                  strong breast fins: we found it in places that were quite dry, where we supposed
                  it might have been left by the tide; but it did not seem to have become languid by
                  the want of water; for upon our approach it leaped away, by the help of the breast
                  fins, as nimbly as a frog: neither indeed did it seem to prefer water to land; for
                  when we found it in the water, it frequently leaped out, and pursued its way upon
                  dry ground: we also observed that when it was in places where small stones were
                  standing above the surface <pb n="530"/> of the water at a little distance from
                  each other,* it chose rather to leap from stone to stone, than to pass through the
                  water; and we saw several of them pass entirely over puddles in this manner, till
                  they came to dry ground, and then leap away. </p><p n="931">In the afternoon we renewed our search after fresh water, but without
                  success; and therefore I determined to make my stay here but short: however,
                  having observed from an eminence that the inlet penetrated a considerable way into
                  the country, I determined to trace it in the morning. </p><p n="932">*At sun-rise I went ashore, and climbing a considerable hill, I took a
                  view of the coast and the islands that lie off it, with their bearings, having an
                  azimuth compass with me for that purpose; but I observed that the needle differed
                  very considerably in its position, even to thirty degrees, in some places more, in
                  others less; and once I found it differ from itself no less than two points in the
                  distance of fourteen feet. I took up some of the loose stones that lay upon the
                  ground, and applied them to the needle, but they produced no effect; and I
                  therefore concluded that there was iron ore in the hills, of which I had remarked
                  other indications both here, and in the neighbouring parts. After I had made my
                  observations upon the hill, I proceeded with Dr. Solander up the inlet; I set out
                  with the first of the flood, and long before high-water I had advanced above eight
                  leagues. Its breadth thus far was from two to five miles, upon a S. W. by S.
                  direction; but here it opened every way, and formed a large lake, which to the N.
                  W. communicated with the sea; and I not only saw the sea in this direction, but
                  found the tide of flood coming strongly in from that point: I also observed an arm
                  of this lake extending to the eastward, and it is not improbable that it may
                  communicate with the sea in the bottom <pb n="531"/> of the bay,* which lies to
                  the westward of Cape Townshend. On the south side of the lake is a ridge of high
                  hills which I was very desirous to climb; but it being high-water, and the day far
                  spent, I was afraid of being bewildered among the shoals in the night, especially
                  as the weather was dark and rainy; and therefore I made the best of my way to the
                  ship. In this excursion I saw only two people, and they were at a distance; they
                  followed the boat along the shore a good way, but the tide running strongly in my
                  favour I could not prudently wait for them: I saw however several fires in one
                  direction, and smoke in another, but they also were at a distance. While I was
                  tracing the inlet with Dr. Solander, Mr. Banks was endeavouring to penetrate into
                  the country, where several of the people who had leave to go ashore were also
                  rambling about. Mr. Banks and his party found their course obstructed by a swamp,
                  covered with mangroves, which however they resolved to pass; the mud was almost
                  knee deep, yet they resolutely went on; but before they got half way, they
                  repented of their undertaking: the bottom was covered with branches of trees
                  interwoven with each other, sometimes they kept their footing upon them, sometimes
                  their feet slipt through, and sometimes they were so entangled among them, that
                  they were forced to free themselves by groping in the mud and slime with their
                  hands. In about an hour however they crossed it, and judged it might be about a
                  quarter of a mile over. After a short walk they came up to a place where there had
                  been four small sires, and near them some shells and bones of fish, that had been
                  roasted: they found also heaps of grass laid together, where four or five people
                  appeared to have slept. The Second Lieutenant, Mr. Gore, who was at another place,
                  saw a little water lying in the bottom of a gully, and near it the track of a
                  large animal: some bustards were also seen, but none <pb n="532"/> of them shot,*
                  nor any other bird except a few of the beautiful loriquets which we had seen in
                  Botany Bay. Mr. Gore, and one of the midshipmen, who were in different places,
                  said that they had heard the voices of Indians near them, but had seen none: the
                  country in general appeared sandy and barren, and being destitute of fresh water,
                  it cannot be supposed to have any settled inhabitants. The deep gullies, which
                  were worn by torrents from the hills, prove, that at certains seasons the rains
                  here are very copious and heavy. </p><p n="933">The inlet in which the ship lay I called THIRSTY SOUND, because it
                  afforded us no fresh water. It lies in latitude <geo select="lat" n="122">22° 10′ S</geo>. and
                  longitude <geo select="lon" n="122">210° 18′ W</geo>.; and may be known by a group of small islands
                  lying under the shore, from two to five leagues distant, in the direction of N. W.
                  and by another group of islands that lie right before it, between three and four
                  leagues out at sea. Over each of the points that form the entrance is a high round
                  hill, which on the N. W. is a peninsula that at high-water is surrounded by the
                  sea: they are bold to both the shores, and the distance between them is about two
                  miles. In this inlet is good anchorage in seven, six, five, and four fathom; and
                  places very convenient for laying a ship down, where, at spring-tides, the water
                  does not rise less than sixteen or eighteen feet. The tide flows at the full and
                  change of the moon about eleven o'clock. I have already observed that here is no
                  fresh water, nor could we procure refreshment of any other kind: we saw two
                  turtles, but we were not able to take either of them: neither did we catch either
                  fish or wild-fowl, except a few small land-birds: we saw indeed the same sorts of
                  water-fowl as in Botany Bay, but they were so shy that we could not get a shot at
                  them. </p><p n="934">As I had not therefore a single inducement to stay longer in this place,*
                  I weighed anchor at six o'clock in the morning <pb n="533"/> of Thursday the <date>31st</date>
                  of May, and put to sea.* We stood to the N. W. with a fresh breeze at S. S. E. and
                  kept without the group of islands that lie in shore, and to the N. W. of Thirsty
                  Sound, as there appeared to be no safe passage between them and the main: at the
                  same time we had a number of islands without us, extending as far as we could see:
                  during our run in this direction our depth of water was ten, eight, and nine
                  fathom. At noon, the west point of Thirsty Sound, which I have called PIER HEAD,
                  bore S. 36 E. distant five leagues; the east point of the other inlet, which
                  communicates with the Sound, bore S. by W. distant two leagues; the group of
                  islands just mentioned lay between us and the point, and the farthest part of the
                  main in sight, on the other side of the inlet, bore N. W. Our latitude by
                  observation was <geo select="lat">21° 53′</geo>. At half an hour after twelve, the boat, which
                  was sounding ahead, made the signal for shoal water, and we immediately hauled our
                  wind to the N. E. At this time we had seven fathom, at the next cast five, and at
                  the next three, upon which we instantly dropped an anchor, that brought the ship
                  up. Pier Head, the north west point of Thirsty-sound, bore S. E. distant six
                  leagues, being half-way between the islands which lie off the east point of the
                  western inlet, and three small islands which lie directly without them. It was now
                  the first of the flood, which we found to set N. W. by W. ½ W.; and having sounded
                  about the shoal, upon which we had three fathom, and found deep water all round
                  it, we got under sail, and having hauled round the three islands that have been
                  just mentioned, came to an anchor under the Ice of them, in fifteen fathom water;
                  and the weather being dark, hazy, and rainy, we remained there till seven o'clock
                  in the morning.* At this time we got again under fail, and stood to the N. W. with
                  a fresh breeze at S. S. E.; having the main land in sight, and a number of <pb n="534"/> islands all round us,* some of which lay out at sea as far as the eye
                  could reach. The western inlet, which in the chart is distinguished by the name of
                  Broad Sound, we had now all open; at the entrance, it is at least nine or ten
                  leagues wide: in it, and before it, lie several islands, and probably shoals also;
                  for our soundings were very irregular, varying suddenly from ten to four fathom.
                  At noon, our latitude by observation was <geo select="lat">21° 29′ S</geo>.; a point of land
                  which forms the north west entrance into Broad Sound, and which I have named CAPE
                  PALMERSTON, lying in latitude <geo select="lat" n="123">21° 30′</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon" n="123">210° 54′ W</geo>.
                  bore W. by N. distant three leagues. Our latitude was 21′ 27′, our longitude
                     <geo select="lon">210° 57′</geo>. Between this Cape and Cape Townshend lies the bay which I
                  have called the BAY OF INLETS. We continued to stand to the N. W. and N. W. by N.
                  as the land lay, under an easy sail, having a boat ahead to sound: at first the
                  soundings were very irregular, from nine to four fathom; but afterwards they were
                  regular, from nine to eleven. At eight in the evening, being about two leagues
                  from the main land, we anchored in eleven fathom, with a sandy bottom; and soon
                  after we found the tide setting with a slow motion to the westward. At one o'clock
                  it was slack, or low-water; and at half an hour after two the ship tended to the
                  eastward, and rode so till six in the morning,* when the tide had risen eleven
                  feet. We now got under sail, and stood away in the direction of the coast, N. N.
                  W. From what we had observed of the tide during the night, it is plain, that the
                  flood came from the N. W.; whereas the preceding day, and several days before, it
                  came from the S. E.; nor was this the first, or even second time that we had
                  remarked the same thing. At sun-rise this morning, we found the variation to be
                     <geo select="lon">6° 45′ E</geo>.; and in steering along the shore, between the island and
                  the main, at the distance of about two leagues from the main, and three or <pb n="535"/> four from the island,* our soundings were regular from twelve to nine
                  fathom; but about eleven o'clock in the forenoon we were again embarrassed with
                  shoal water, having at one time not more than three fathom; yet we got clear,
                  without casting anchor. At noon we were about two leagues from the main, and four
                  from the islands without us. Our latitude by observation was <geo select="lat">20° 56′</geo>,
                  and a high promontory, which I named CAPE HILLSBOROUGH, bore W. ½ N. distant seven
                  miles. The land here is diversified by mountains, hills, plains, and valleys, and
                  seems to be well clothed with herbage and wood: the islands which lie parallel to
                  the coast, and from five to eight or nine miles distant, are of various height and
                  extent; scarcely any of them are more than five leagues in circumference, and many
                  are not four miles: besides this chain of islands, which lies at a distance from
                  the coast, there are others much less, which lie under the land, from which we saw
                  smoke rising in different places. We continued to steer along the shore at the
                  distance of about two leagues, with regular soundings from nine to ten fathom. At
                  sun-set, the farthest point of the main bore N. 48 W. and to the northward of this
                  lay some high land, which I took to be an island, and of which the north west
                  point bore 41 W.; but not being sure of a passage, I came to an anchor about eight
                  o'clock in the evening, in ten fathom water, with a muddy bottom. About ten we had
                  a tide setting to the northward, and at two it had fallen nine feet; after this it
                  began to rise, and the flood came from the northward, in the direction of the
                  islands which lay out to sea; a plain indication that there was no passage to the
                  N. W. This however had not appeared at day-break,* when we got under sail and
                  stood to the N. W. At eight o'clock in the morning, we discovered low land quite
                  across what we took for an opening, which proved to be a bay, about five or six
                     <pb n="536"/> leagues deep;* upon this we hauled our wind to the eastward round
                  the north point of the bay, which at this time bore from us N. E. by N. distant
                  four leagues: from this point we found the land trend way N. by W. ½ W. and a
                  streight or passage between it and a large island, or islands, lying parallel to
                  it. Having the tide of ebb in our favour, we stood for this passage; and at noon
                  were just within the entrance: our latitude by observation was <geo select="lat">20° 26′
                     S</geo>.; Cape Hillsborough bore S. by E. distant ten leagues; and the north
                  point of the bay S. 19 W. distant four miles. This point, which I named CAPE
                  CONWAY, lies in latitude <geo select="lat" n="124">26° 36′ S</geo>. longitude <geo select="lon" n="124">211° 28′ W</geo>.;
                  and the bay which lies between this Cape and Cape Hillsborough I called REPULSE
                  BAY. The greatest depth of water which we found in it was thirteen fathom, and the
                  least eight. In all parts there was safe anchorage, and I believe that, upon
                  proper examination, some good harbours would be found in it; especially at the
                  north side within Cape Conway; for just within that Cape there lie two or three
                  small islands, which alone would shelter that side of the bay from the southerly
                  and south easterly winds, that seem to prevail here as a Trade. Among the many
                  islands that lie upon this coast, there is one more remarkable than the rest; it
                  is of a small circuit, very high and peaked, and lies E. by S. ten miles from Cape
                  Conway, at the south end of the passage. In the afternoon, we steered through this
                  passage, which we found to be from three to seven miles broad, and eight or nine
                  leagues in length, N. by W. ½ W., S. by E. ½ E. It is formed by the main on the
                  west, and by the islands on the east, one of which is at least five leagues in
                  length: our depth of water in running through was from twenty to five and twenty
                  fathom, with good anchorage every where, and the whole passage may be considered
                  as one safe harbour, exclusive of the small bays and coves which abound on each
                     <pb n="537"/> side, where ships might lie as in a bason.* The land both upon
                  the main and islands is high, and diversified by hill and valley, wood and lawn,
                  with a green and pleasant appearance. On one of the islands we discovered with our
                  glasses two men and a woman, and a canoe with an outrigger, which appeared to be
                  larger, and of a construction very different from those of bark tied together at
                  the ends, which we had seen upon other parts of the coast; we hoped therefore that
                  the people here had made some farther advances beyond mere animal life than those
                  that we had seen before. At six o'clock in the evening, we were nearly the length
                  of the north end of the passage; the north westermost point of the main in sight
                  bore N. 54 W. and the north end of the island N. N. E. with an open sea between
                  the two points. As this passage was discovered on Whitsunday, I called it
                  WHITSUNDAY's PASSAGE, and I called the islands that form it CUMBERLAND ISLANDS, in
                  honour of his Royal Highness the Duke. We kept under an easy sail, with the lead
                  going all night, being at the distance of about three leagues from the shore, and
                  having from twenty-one to twenty-three fathom water. Ar day-break,* we were
                  abreast of the point which had been the farthest in sight to the north west the
                  evening before, which I named CAPE GLOUCESTER. It is a lofty promontory, in
                  latitude <geo select="lat" n="125">19° 59′ S</geo>. longitude <geo select="lon" n="125">211° 49′ W</geo>. and may be known
                  by an island which lies out at sea N. by W. ½ W. at the distance of five or six
                  leagues from it, and which I called HOLBORNE ISLE; there are also islands lying
                  under the land between Holborne Isle, and Whitsunday's Passage. On the west side
                  of Cape Gloucester the land trends away S. W. and S. S. W. and forms a deep bay,
                  the bottom of which I could but just see from the mast-head: it is very low, and a
                  continuation of the low land which we had seen at the bottom of Repulse Bay. This
                  bay I called EDGCUMBE BAY, <pb n="538"/> but without staying to look into it,* we
                  continued our course to the westward, for the farthest land we could see in that
                  direction, which bore W. by N. ½ N. and appeared very high. At noon, we were about
                  three leagues from the shore, by observation in latitude <geo select="lat">19° 47′ S</geo>. and
                  Cape Gloucester bore S. 63 E. distant seven leagues and an half. At six in the
                  evening, we were abreast of the westermost point just mentioned, at about three
                  miles distance, and because it rises abruptly from the low lands which surround
                  it, I called it CAPE UPSTART. It lies in latitude <geo select="lat" n="126">19° 39′ S</geo>. longitude
                  <geo select="lon" n="126">212° 32′ W</geo>. fourteen leagues W. N. W. from Cape Gloucester, and is
                  of a height sufficient to be seen at the distance of twelve leagues: inland there
                  are some high hills or mountains, which, like the Cape, afford but a barren
                  prospect. Having passed this Cape, we continued standing to the W. N. W. as the
                  land lay, under an easy sail, having from sixteen to ten fathom,* till two o'clock
                  in the morning, when we fell into seven fathom; upon which we hauled our wind to
                  the northward, judging ourselves to be very near land: at day-break, we found our
                  conjecture to be true, being within little more than two leagues of it. In this
                  part of the coast the land, being very low, is nearer than it appears to be,
                  though it is diversified with here and there a hill. At noon, we were about four
                  leagues from the land, in fifteen fathom water, and our latitude, by observation,
                  was <geo select="lat" n="127">19° 12′ S</geo>. Cape Upstart bearing S. <geo select="lon" n="127">32° 30′ E</geo>. distant
                  twelve leagues. About this time some very large columns of smoke were seen rising
                  from the low lands. At sun-set, the preceding night, when we were close under Cape
                  Upstart, the variation was nearly <geo select="lon">9° E</geo>. and at sun-rise this day, it
                  was no more than <geo select="lon">5° 35′</geo>; I judged therefore that it had been influenced
                  by iron ore, or other magnetical matter, contained under the surface of the earth. </p><p n="935"><pb n="539"/>We continued to steer W. N. W. as the land lay,* with twelve or
                  fourteen fathom water, till noon on the <date>6th</date>, when our latitude, by observation,
                  was if <geo select="lat">19° 1′ S</geo>. and we had the mouth of a bay all open, extending from
                  S. ½ E. to S. W. ½ S. distant two leagues. This bay, which I named CLEAVELAND BAY,
                  appeared to be about five or six miles in extent every way: the east point I named
                  CAPE CLEAVELAND, and the west, which had the appearance of an island, MAGNETICAL
                  ISLE, as we perceived that the compass did not traverse well when we were near it:
                  they are both high, and so is the main land within them, the whole forming a
                  surface the most rugged, rocky, and barren of any we had seen upon the coast; it
                  was not however without inhabitants, for we saw smoke in several parts of the
                  bottom of the bay. The northermost land that was in fight at this time, bore N. W.
                  and it had the appearance of an island, for we could not trace the main land
                  farther than W. by N. We steered W. N. W. keeping the main land on board, the
                  outermost part of which, at sun-set, bore W. by N. but without it lay high land,
                  which we judged not to be part of it.* At daybreak, we were abreast of the eastern
                  part of this land, which we found to be a group of islands, lying about five
                  leagues from the main: at this time, being between the two shores, we advanced
                  slowly to the N. W. till noon, when our latitude, by observation, was <geo select="lat">18° 49′
                     S</geo>. and our distance from the main about five leagues: the north west part
                  of it bore from us N. by W. ½ W. the islands extending from N. to E. and the
                  nearest being distant about two miles: Cape Cleaveland bore S. 50 E. distant
                  eighteen leagues. Our soundings, in the course that we had sailed between this
                  time and the preceding noon, were from fourteen to eleven fathom. </p><p n="936">In the afternoon, we saw several large columns of smoke upon the main; we
                  saw also some people and canoes, and <pb n="540"/> upon one of the islands what
                  had the appearance of cocoa nut-trees:* as a few of these nuts would now have been
                  very acceptable, I sent Lieutenant Hicks ashore, and with him went Mr. Banks and
                  Dr. Solander, to see what refreshment could be procured, while I kept standing in
                  for the island with the ship. About seven o'clock in the evening they returned,
                  with an account that what we had taken for cocoa nut-trees, were a small kind of
                  cabbage palm, and that, except about fourteen or fifteen plants, they had met with
                  nothing worth bringing away. While they were ashore, they saw none of the people,
                  but just as they had put off, one of them came very near the beach, and shouted
                  with a loud voice; it was so dark that they could not see him, however they turned
                  towards the shore, but when he heard the boat putting back, he ran away or hid
                  himself, for they could not get a glimpse of him, and though they shouted he made
                  no reply. After the return of the boats, we stood away N. by W. for the
                  northermost land in fight, of which we were abreast at three o'clock in the
                  morning,* having passed all the islands three or four hours before. This land, on
                  account of its figure, I named POINT HILLOCK: it is of a considerable height, and
                  may be known by a round hillock, or rock, which joins to the Point, but appears to
                  be detached from it. Between this Cape and Magnetical Isle the shore forms a large
                  bay, which I called HALIFAX BAY: before it lay the group of islands which has been
                  just mentioned, and some others, at a less distance from the shore. By these
                  islands the Bay is sheltered from all winds, and it affords good anchorage. The
                  land near the beach, in the bottom of the Bay, is low and woody, but farther back
                  it is one continued ridge of high land, which appeared to be barren and rocky.
                  Having passed Point Hillock, we continued standing to the N. N. W. as the land
                  trended, having the advantage of a light <pb n="541"/> moon. At six,* we were
                  abreast of a point of land which lies N. by W. ½ W. distant eleven miles from
                  Point Hillock, which I named CAPE SANDWICH. Between these two points the land is
                  very high, and the surface is craggy and barren. Cape Sandwich may be known not
                  only by the high craggy land over it, but by a small island which lies east of it,
                  at the distance of a mile, and some others that lie about two leagues to the
                  northward. From Cape Sandwich the land trends W. and afterwards N. forming a fine
                  large bay, which I called ROCKINGHAM BAY, where there appears to be good shelter,
                  and good anchorage, but I did not stay to examine it: I kept ranging along the
                  shore to the northward, for a cluster of small islands, which lie off the northern
                  point of the Bay. Between the three outermost of these islands, and those near the
                  shore, I found a channel of about a mile broad, through which I passed, and upon
                  one of the nearest islands we saw with our glasses about thirty of the natives,
                  men, women, and children, all standing together, and looking with great attention
                  at the ship; the first instance of curiosity that we had seen among them: they
                  were all stark naked, with short hair, and of the same complexion with those that
                  we had seen before. At noon, our latitude, by observation, was <geo select="lat">17° 59′</geo>,
                  and we were abreast of the north point of Rockingham Bay, which bore from us W. at
                  the distance of about two miles. This boundary of the Bay is formed by an island
                  of considerable height, which in the chart is distinguished by the name of DUNK
                  ISLE, and which lies so near the shore as not to be easily distinguished from it.
                  Our longitude was <geo select="lon">213° 57′ W</geo>. Cape Sandwich bore S. by E. ½ E. distant
                  nineteen miles, and the northermost land in sight N. ½ W.: our depth of water for
                  the last ten hours had not been more than sixteen, nor less than seven fathom. At
                  sunset, the northern extremity of the land bore N. 25 W. and we <pb n="542"/> kept
                  our course N. by W. along the coast,* at the distance of between three and four
                  leagues, with an easy sail all night, having from twelve to fifteen fathom water. </p><p n="937">*At six o'clock in the morning, we were abreast of some small islands,
                  which we called FRANKLAND's ISLES, and which lie about two leagues distant from
                  the main land. The most distant point in sight to the northward bore N. by W. ½ W.
                  and we thought it was part of the main, but afterwards found it to be an island of
                  considerable height, and about four miles in circuit. Between this island and a
                  point on the main, from which it is distant about two miles, I passed with the
                  ship. At noon, we were in the middle of the channel, and by observation in the
                  latitude of <geo select="lat">16° 57′ S</geo>. with twenty fathom water. The point on the main,
                  of which we were now abreast, I called CAPE GRAFTON: its latitude is <geo select="lat" n="128">16° 57′
                     S</geo>. and longitude <geo select="lon" n="128">214° 6′ W</geo>. and the land here, as well as the
                  whole coast for about twenty leagues to the southward, is high, has a rocky
                  surface, and is thinly covered with wood: during the night we had seen several
                  sires, and about noon some people. Having hauled round Cape Grafton, we found the
                  land trend away N. W. by W. and three miles to the westward of the Cape we found a
                  bay, in which we anchored about two miles from the shore, in four fathom water
                  with an ouzey bottom. The east point of the bay bore S. 74 E. the west point S. 83
                  W. and a low, green, woody island, which lies in the offing, N. 35 E. This island,
                  which lies N. by E. ½ E. distant three or four leagues from Cape Grafton, is
                  called in the chart GREEN ISLAND. </p><p n="938">As soon as the ship was brought to an anchor, I went ashore, accompanied
                  by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander. As my principal view was to procure some fresh
                  water, and as the bottom of the bay was low land covered with mangroves, <pb n="543"/> where it was not probable fresh water was to be found,* I went out
                  towards the Cape, and found two small streams, which however were rendered very
                  difficult of access by the surf and rocks upon the shore: I saw also, as I came
                  round the Cape, a small stream of water run over the beach, in a sandy cove, but I
                  did not go in with the boat, because I saw that it would not be easy to land. When
                  we got ashore, we found the country every where rising into steep rocky hills, and
                  as no fresh water could conveniently be procured, I was unwilling to lose time by
                  going in search of lower land elsewhere: we therefore made the best of our way
                  back to the ship, and about midnight we weighed and stood to the N. W. having but
                  little wind, with some showers of rain.* At four in the morning, the breeze
                  freshened at S. by E. and the weather became fair: we continued steering N. N. W.
                  ½ W. as the land lay, at about three leagues distance, with ten, twelve, and
                  fourteen fathom water. At ten, we hauled off north, in order to get without a
                  small low island, which lay at about two leagues distance from the main, and great
                  part of which at this time, it being high water, was overflowed: about three
                  leagues to the north west of this island, close under the main land, is another
                  island, the land of which rises to a greater height, and which at noon bore from
                  us N. 55 W. distant seven or eight miles. At this time, our latitude was <geo select="lat">16°
                     20′ S</geo>. Cape Grafton bore S. 29 E. distant forty miles, and the
                  northermost point of land in sight N. 20 W.; our depth of water was fifteen
                  fathom. Between this point and Cape Grafton, the shore forms a large, but not a
                  very deep bay, which being discovered on Trinity Sunday, I called TRINITY BAY. </p></div><pb n="544"/><div type="chapter" n="33"><head><l>CHAP.V.</l><l><emph rend="italic"> Dangerous Situation of the Ship in her Course from Trinity

                  all parts conceals shoals that suddenly project from the shore, and rocks that
                  rise abruptly like a pyramid from the bottom, for an extent of two and twenty
                  degrees of latitude, more than one thousand three hundred miles; and therefore
                  hitherto none of the names which distinguish the several parts of the country that
                  we saw, are memorials of distress; but here we became acquainted with misfortune,
                  and we therefore called the point which we had just seen farthest to the
                  northward, CAPE TRIBULATION. </p><p n="940">This Cape lies in latitude <geo select="lat" n="129">16° 6′ S</geo>. and longitude <geo select="lon" n="129">214°
                     39′ W</geo>. We steered along the shore N. by W. at the distance of between
                  three and four leagues, having from fourteen to twelve, and ten fathom water: in
                  the offing we saw two islands, which lie in latitude <geo select="lat">16° S</geo>. and about
                  six or seven leagues from the main. At six in the evening, the northermost land in
                  sight bore N. by W. ½ W. and two low woody islands, which some of us took to be
                  rocks above water, bore N. ½ W. At this time we shortened sail, and hauled off
                  shore E. N. E. and N. E. by E. close upon a wind, for it was my design to stretch
                  off all night, as well to avoid the danger we saw ahead, as to see whether any
                  islands lay in the offing, especially <pb n="545"/> as we were now near the
                  latitude assigned to the islands which were discovered by Quiros,* and which some
                  geographers, for what reason I know not, have thought fit to join to this land. We
                  had the advantage of a fine breeze, and a clear moonlight night, and in standing
                  off from six till near nine o'clock, we deepened our water from fourteen to
                  twenty-one fathom, but while we were at supper it suddenly shoaled, and we fell
                  into twelve, ten, and eight fathom, within the space of a few minutes; I
                  immediately ordered every body to their station, and all was ready to put about
                  and come to an anchor, but meeting at the next cast of the lead with deep water
                  again, we concluded that we had gone over the tail of the shoals which we had seen
                  at sun-set, and that all danger was past: before ten, we had twenty and one and
                  twenty fathom, and this depth continuing, the gentlemen left the deck in great
                  tranquility, and went to bed; but a few minutes before eleven, the water shallowed
                  at once from twenty to seventeen fathom, and before the lead could be cast again,
                  the ship struck, and remained immoveable, except by the heaving of the surge, that
                  beat her against the craggs of the rock upon which she lay. In a few moments every
                  body was upon the deck, with countenances which sufficiently expressed the horrors
                  of our situation. We had stood off the shore three hours and a half, with a
                  pleasant breeze, and therefore knew that we could not be very near it, and we had
                  too much reason to conclude that we were upon a rock of coral, which is more fatal
                  than any other, because the points of it are sharp, and every part of the surface
                  so rough as to grind away whatever is rubbed against it, even with the gentlest
                  motion. In this situation all the sails were immediately taken in, and the boats
                  hoisted out to examine the depth of water round the ship: we soon discovered that
                  our fears had not aggravated our misfortune, <pb n="546"/> and that the vessel had
                  been lifted over a ledge of the rock,* and lay in a hollow within it: in some
                  places there was from three to four fathom, and in others not so many feet. The
                  ship lay with her head to the N. E.; and at the distance of about thirty yards on
                  the starboard side, the water deepened to eight, ten, and twelve fathom. As soon
                  as the long-boat was out, we struck our yards and top-masts, and carried out the
                  stream anchor on the starboard bow, got the coasting anchor and cable into the
                  boat, and were going to carry it out the same way; but upon sounding a second time
                  round the ship, the water was found to be deepest astern: the anchor therefore was
                  carried out from the starboard quarter instead of the starboard bow, that is, from
                  the stern instead of the head, and having taken ground, our utmost force was
                  applied to the capstern, hoping that if the anchor did not come home, the ship
                  would be got off, but to our great misfortune and disappointment we could not move
                  her: during all this time she continued to beat with great violence against the
                  rock, so that it was with the utmost difficulty that we kept upon our legs; and to
                  complete the scene of distress, we saw by the light of the moon the sheathing
                  boards from the bottom of the vessel floating away all round her, and at last her
                  false keel, so that every moment was making way for the sea to rush in which was
                  to swallow us up. We had now no chance but to lighten her, and we had lost the
                  opportunity of doing that to the greatest advantage, for unhappily we went on
                  shore just at high water, and by this time it had considerably fallen, so that
                  after she should be lightened so as to draw as much less water as the water had
                  sunk, we should be but in the same situation as at first; and the only alleviation
                  of this circumstance was, that as the tide ebbed the ship settled to the rocks,
                  and was not beaten against them with so much violence. We had indeed some hope
                  from the <pb n="547"/> next tide,* but it was doubtful whether she would hold
                  together so long, especially as the rock kept grating her bottom under the
                  starboard bow with such force as to be heard in the fore store-room. This however
                  was no time to indulge conjecture, nor was any effort remitted in despair of
                  success: that no time might be lost, the water was immediately started in the
                  hold, and pumped up; six of our guns, being all we had upon the deck, our iron and
                  stone ballast, casks, hoop staves, oil jars, decayed stores, and many other things
                  that lay in the way of heavier materials, were thrown overboard with the utmost
                  expedition, every one exerting himself with an alacrity almost approaching to
                  cheerfulness, without the least repining or discontent; yet the men were so far
                  imprest with a sense of their situation, that not an oath was heard among them,
                  the habit of profaneness, however strong, being instantly subdued, by the dread of
                  incurring guilt when death seemed to be so near. </p><p n="941">While we were thus employed, day broke upon us,* and we saw the land at
                  about eight leagues distance, without any island in the intermediate space, upon
                  which, if the ship should have gone to pieces, we might have been set ashore by
                  the boats, and from which they might have taken us by different turns to the main:
                  the wind however gradually died away, and early in the forenoon it was a dead
                  calm; if it had blown hard, the ship must inevitably have been destroyed. At
                  eleven in the forenoon we expected high water, and anchors were got out, and every
                  thing made ready for another effort to heave her off if she should float, but to
                  our inexpressible surprize and concern she did not float by a foot and a half,
                  though we had lightened her near fifty ton, so much did the day-tide fall short of
                  that in the night. We now proceeded to lighten her still more, and threw overboard
                  every thing that it was possible for us to <pb n="548"/> spare:* hitherto she had
                  not admitted much water, but as the tide fell, it rushed in so fast, that two
                  pumps, incessantly worked, could scarcely keep her free. At two o'clock, she lay
                  heeling two or three streaks to starboard, and the pinnace, which lay under her
                  bows, touched the ground: we had now no hope but from the tide at midnight, and to
                  prepare for it we carried out our two bower anchors, one on the starboard quarter,
                  and the other right a-stern, got the blocks and tackle which were to give us a
                  purchase upon the cables in order, and brought the falls, or ends of them, in
                  abaft, straining them tight, that the next effort might operate upon the ship, and
                  by shortening the length of the cable between that and the anchors, draw her off
                  the ledge upon which she rested, towards the deep water. About five o'clock in the
                  afternoon, we observed the tide begin to rise, but we observed at the same time
                  that the leak increased to a most alarming degree, so that two more pumps were
                  manned, but unhappily only one of them would work: three of the pumps however were
                  kept going, and at nine o'clock the ship righted, but the leak had gained upon us
                  so considerably, that it was imagined she must go to the bottom as soon as she
                  ceased to be supported by the rock: this was a dreadful circumstance, so that we
                  anticipated the floating of the ship not as an earnest of deliverance, but as an
                  event that would probably precipitate our destruction. We well knew that our boats
                  were not capable of carrying us all on shore, and that when the dreadful crisis
                  should arrive, as all command and subordination would be at an end, a contest for
                  preference would probably ensue, that would increase the horrors even of
                  shipwreck, and terminate in the destruction of us all by the hands of each other;
                  yet we knew that if any should be left on board to perish in the waves, they would
                  probably suffer less upon the whole than those who <pb n="549"/> should get on
                  shore,* without any lasting or effectual defence against the natives, in a
                  country, where even nets and firearms would scarcely furnish them with food; and
                  where, if they should find the means of subsistence, they must be condemned to
                  languish out the remainder of life in a desolate wilderness, without the
                  possession, or even hope, of any domestic comfort, and cut off from all commerce
                  with mankind, except the naked savages who prowled the desert, and who perhaps
                  were some of the most rude and uncivilized upon the earth. </p><p n="942">To those only who have waited in a state of such suspense, death has
                  approached in all his terrors; and as the dreadful moment that was to determine
                  our fate came on, every one saw his own sensations pictured in the countenances of
                  his companions: however, the capstan and windlace were manned with as many hands
                  as could be spared from the pumps, and the ship floating about twenty minutes
                  after ten o'clock, the effort was made, and she was heaved into deep water. It was
                  some comfort to find that she did not now admit more water than she had done upon
                  the rock; and though, by the gaining of the leak upon the pumps, there was no less
                  than three feet nine inches water in the hold, yet the men did not relinquish
                  their labour, and we held the water as it were at bay; but having now endured
                  excessive fatigue of body and agitation of mind for more than four and twenty
                  hours, and having but little hope of succeeding at last, they began to flag: none
                  of them could work at the pump more than five or six minutes together, and then,
                  being totally exhausted, they threw themselves down upon the deck, though a stream
                  of water was running over it from the pumps between three and four inches deep;
                  when those who succeeded them had worked their spell, and were exhausted in their
                  turn, they threw themselves down in the same manner, and the others <pb n="550"/>
                  started up again,* and renewed their labour; thus relieving each other till an
                  accident was very near putting an end to their efforts at once. The planking which
                  lines the inside of the ship's bottom is called the cieling, and between this, and
                  the outside planking, there is a space of about eighteen inches: the man who till
                  this time had attended the well to take the depth of water, had taken it only to
                  the cieling, and gave the measure accordingly; but he being now relieved, the
                  person who came in his stead, reckoned the depth to the outside planking, by which
                  it appeared in a few minutes to have gained upon the pumps eighteen inches, the
                  difference between the planking without and within. Upon this, even the bravest
                  was upon the point of giving up his labour with his hope, and in a few minutes
                  every thing would have been involved in all the confusion of despair. But this
                  accident, however dreadful in its first consequences, was eventually the cause of
                  our preservation: the mistake was soon detected, and the sudden joy which every
                  man felt upon finding his situation better than his fears had suggested, operated
                  like a charm, and seemed to possess him with a strong belief that scarcely any
                  real danger remained. New confidence and new hope, however founded, inspired new
                  vigour; and though our state was the same as when the men first began to slacken
                  in their labour, through weariness and despondency, they now renewed their efforts
                  with such alacrity and spirit, that before eight o'clock in the morning the leak
                  was so far from having gained upon the pumps, that the pumps had gained
                  considerably upon the leak. Every body now talked of getting the ship into some
                  harbour, as a thing not to be doubted, and as hands could be spared from the
                  pumps, they were employed in getting up the anchors: the stream anchor and best
                  bower we had taken on board; but it was found impossible to save the little bower,
                  and therefore it <pb n="551"/> was cut away at a whole cable:* we lost also the
                  cable of the stream anchor among the rocks; but in our situation these were
                  trifles which scarcely attracted our notice. Our next business was to get up the
                  fore-topmast and fore-yard, and warp the ship to the southeast, and at eleven,
                  having now a breeze from the sea, we once more got under sail and stood for the
                  land. </p><p n="943">It was however impossible long to continue the labour by which the pumps
                  had been made to gain upon the leak, and as the exact situation of it could not be
                  discovered, we had no hope of stopping it within. In this situation, Mr.
                  Monkhouse,* one of my midshipmen, came to me and proposed an expedient that he had
                  once seen used on board a merchant ship, which sprung a leak that admitted above
                  four feet water an hour, and which by this expedient was brought safely from
                  Virginia to London; the master having such confidence in it, that he took her out
                  of harbour, knowing her condition, and did not think it worth while to wait till
                  the leak could be otherwise stopped. To this man, therefore, the care of the
                  expedient, which is called fothering the ship, was immediately committed, four or
                  five of the people being appointed to assist him, and he performed it in this
                  manner: He took a lower studding sail, and having mixed together a large quantity
                  of oakham and wool, chopped pretty small, he stitched it down in handfuls upon the
                  sail, as lightly as possible, and over this he spread the dung of our sheep and
                  other filth; but horse dung, if we had had it, would have been better. When the
                  sail was thus prepared, it was hauled under the ship's bottom by ropes, which kept
                  it extended, and when it came under the leak, the suction which carried in the
                  water, carried in with it the oakham and wool from the surface of the sail, which
                  in other parts the water was <pb n="552"/> not sufficiently agitated to wash off.*
                  By the success of this expedient our leak was so far reduced, that instead of
                  gaining upon three pumps, it was easily kept under with one. This was a new source
                  of confidence and comfort; the people could scarcely have expressed more joy if
                  they had been already in port; and their views were so far from being limited to
                  running the ship ashore in some harbour, either of an island or the main, and
                  building a vessel out of her materials, to carry us to the East Indies, which had
                  so lately been the utmost object of our hope, that nothing was now thought of but
                  ranging along the shore in search of a convenient place to repair the damage she
                  had sustained, and then prosecuting the voyage upon the same plan as if nothing
                  had happened. Upon this occasion I must observe, both in justice and gratitude to
                  the ship's company, and the Gentlemen on board, that although in the midst of our
                  distress every one seemed to have a just sense of his danger, yet no passionate
                  exclamations, or frantic gestures, were to be heard or seen; every one appeared to
                  have the perfect possession of his mind, and every one exerted himself to the
                  uttermost, with a quiet and patient perseverance, equally distant from the
                  tumultuous violence of terror, and the gloomy inactivity of despair. </p><p n="944">In the mean time, having light airs at E.S.E. we got up the main-topmast,
                  and main-yard, and kept edging in for the land, till about six o'clock in the
                  evening, when we came to an anchor in seventeen fathom water, at the distance of
                  seven leagues from the shore, and one from the ledge of rocks upon which we had
                  struck. </p><p n="945">This ledge or shoal lies in latitude <geo select="lat">15° 45′ S</geo>. and between six
                  and seven leagues from the main. It is not however the only shoal on this part of
                  the coast, especially to the northward; <pb n="553"/> and at this time we saw one
                  to the southward,* the tail of which we passed over, when we had uneven soundings
                  about two hours before we struck. A part of this shoal is always above water, and
                  has the appearance of white sand: a part also of that upon which we had lain is
                  dry at low water, and in that place consists of sand stones; but all the rest of
                  it is a coral rock. </p><p n="946">While we lay at anchor for the night, we found that the ship made about
                  fifteen inches water an hour, from which no immediate danger was to be
                  apprehended; and at six o'clock in the morning,* we weighed and stood to the N. W.
                  still edging in for the land with a gentle breeze at S. S. E. At nine we passed
                  close without two small islands that lie in latitude <geo select="lat">15° 41′ S</geo>. and
                  about four leagues from the main: to reach these islands had, in the height of our
                  distress, been the object of our hope, or perhaps rather of our wishes, and
                  therefore I called them HOPE ISLANDS. At noon we were about three leagues from the
                  land, and in latitude <geo select="lat">15° 37′ S</geo>.; the northermost part of the main in
                  sight bore N. 30 W.; and Hope Islands extended from S. 30 E. to S. 40 E. In this
                  situation we had twelve fathom water, and several sand-banks without us. At this
                  time the leak had not increased; but that we might be prepared for all events, we
                  got the sail ready for another fothering. In the afternoon, having a gentle breeze
                  at S. E. by E. I sent out the Master with two boats, as well to sound ahead of the
                  ship, as to look out for a harbour where we might repair our defects, and put the
                  ship in a proper trim. At three o'clock, we saw an opening that had the appearance
                  of an harbour, and stood off and on while the boats examined it; but they soon
                  found that there was not depth of water in it sufficient for the ship. When it was
                  near sunset, there being many shoals about us, we <pb n="554"/> anchored in four
                  fathom,* at the distance of about two miles from the shore, the land extending
                  from N. ½ E. to S. by E. ½ E. The pinnace was still out with one of the mates; but
                  at nine o'clock she returned, and reported, that about two leagues to leeward she
                  had discovered just such a harbour as we wanted, in which there was a sufficient
                  rise of water, and every other convenience that could be desired, either for
                  laying the ship ashore, or heaving her down. </p><p n="947">In consequence of this information, I weighed at six o'clock in the
                  morning,* and having sent two boats ahead, to lie upon the shoals that we saw in
                  our way, we ran down to the place; but notwithstanding our precaution, we were
                  once in three fathom water. As soon as these shoals were passed, I sent the boats
                  to lie in the channel that led to the harbour, and by this time it began to blow.
                  It was happy far us that a place of refuge was at hand; for we soon found that the
                  ship would not work, having twice missed stays: our situation, however, though it
                  might have been much worse, was not without danger; we were entangled among
                  shoals, and I had great reason to fear being driven to leeward, before the boats
                  could place themselves so as to prescribe our course. I therefore anchored in four
                  fathom, about a mile from the shore, and then made the signal for the boats to
                  come on board. When this was done I went myself and buoyed the channel, which I
                  found very narrow; the harbour also I found smaller than I expected, but most
                  excellently adapted to our purpose; and it is remarkable, that in the whole course
                  of our voyage we had seen no place which, in our present circumstances, could have
                  afforded us the same relief. At noon, our latitude was <geo select="lat">15° 26′ S</geo>.
                  During all the rest of this day, and the whole night, it blew too fresh for us to
                  venture from our anchor and run into the harbour; and for <pb n="555"/> our
                  farther security, we got down the top-gallant yards,* unbent the mainsail and some
                  of the small sails; got down the fore-top-gallant mast, and the gibb boom, and
                  sprit-sail, with a view to lighten the ship forwards as much as possible, in order
                  to come at her leak, which we supposed to be somewhere in that part; for in all
                  the joy of our unexpected deliverance, we had not forgot that at this time there
                  was nothing but a lock of wool between us and destruction. The gale continuing, we
                  kept our station all the <date>15th</date>.* On the <date>16th</date>, it was somewhat more moderate;* and
                  about six o'clock in the morning, we hove the cable short, with a design to get
                  under sail, but were obliged to desist, and veer it out again. It is remarkable
                  that the sea breeze, which blew fresh when we anchored, continued to do so almost
                  every day while we stayed here; it was calm only while we were upon the rock,
                  except once; and even the gale that afterwards wafted us to the shore, would then
                  certainly have beaten us to pieces. In the evening of the preceding day, we had
                  observed a fire near the beach over against us; and as it would be necessary for
                  us to stay sometime in this place, we were not without hope of making an
                  acquaintance with the people. We saw more fires upon the hills to-day, and with
                  our glasses discovered four Indians going along the shore, who stopped, and made
                  two fires; but for what purpose it was impossible we should guess. </p><p n="948">The scurvy now began to make its appearance among us, with many formidable
                  symptoms. Our poor Indian, Tupia, who had some time before complained that his
                  gums were sore and swelled, and who had taken plentifully of our lemon juice by
                  the Surgeon's direction, had now livid spots upon his legs, and other indubitable
                  testimonies that the disease had made a rapid progress, notwithstanding all our
                  remedies, among which the bark had been liberally administered. <pb n="556"/> Mr.
                  Green,* our astronomer, was also declining; and these, among other circumstances,
                  imbittered the delay which prevented our going ashore. </p><p n="949">*In the morning of the <date>17th</date>, though the wind was still fresh, we ventured
                  to weigh, and push in for the harbour; but in doing this we twice run the ship
                  aground: the first time she went off without any trouble, but the second time she
                  stuck fast. We now got down the fore yard, fore topmasts, and booms, and taking
                  them overboard, made a raft of them alongside of the ship. The tide was happily
                  rising, and about one o'clock in the afternoon, she floated. We soon warped her
                  into the harbour, and having moored her alongside of a steep beach to the south,
                  we got the anchors, cables, and all the hawsers on shore before night. </p><p n="950"><!--Page  [unnumbered]--></p><p n="951">[illustration]</p></div><pb n="557"/><div type="chapter" n="34"><head><l>CHAP.VI.</l><l><emph rend="italic"> Transactions while the Ship was refitting in Endeavour

                        Productions.</emph></l></head><p n="952">IN the morning of Monday the <date>18th</date>,* a stage was made from the ship to the
                  shore, which was so bold that she floated at twenty feet distance: two tents were
                  also set up, one for the sick, and the other for stores and provisions, which were
                  landed in the course of the day. We also landed all the empty water casks, and
                  part of the stores. As soon as the tent for the sick was got ready for their
                  reception, they were sent ashore to the number of eight or nine, and the boat was
                  dispatch•d to haul the seine, in hopes of procuring some fish for the••
                  refreshment; but she returned without success. In the mean time, I climbed one of
                  the highest hills among those that overlooked the harbour, which afforded by no
                  means a comfortable prospect: the low land near the river is wholly over-run with
                  mangroves, among which the salt-water slows every tide; and the high land appeared
                  to be every where stoney and barren. In the mean time Mr. Banks had also taken a
                  walk up the country, and met with the frames of several old Indian houses, and
                  places where they had dressed shell-fish; but they seemed not to have been
                  frequented for some months. Tupia, who had employed himself in angling, and lived
                  intirely upon what he caught, recovered in a surprising degree; but Mr. Green
                  still continued to be extremely ill. </p><p n="953"><pb n="558"/>*The next morning I got the four remaining guns out of the hold, and
                  mounted them upon the quarter-deck; I also got a spare anchor, and anchor-stock
                  ashore, and the remaining part of the stores and ballast that were in the hold:
                  set up the smith's forge, and employed the armourer and his mate to make nails and
                  other necessaries for the repair of the ship. In the afternoon, all the officers'
                  stores and the ground tier of water were got out; so that nothing remained in the
                  fore and main hold, but the coals, and a small quantity of stone ballast. This day
                  Mr. Banks crossed the river to take a view of the country on the other side: he
                  found it consist principally of sand-hills, where he saw some Indian houses, which
                  appeared to have been very lately inhabited. In his walk, he met with vast flocks
                  of pigeons and crows: of the pigeons, which were exceedingly beautiful, he shot
                  several; but the crows, which were exactly like those in England, were so shy that
                  he could not get within reach of them. </p><p n="954">*On the <date>20th</date>, we landed the powder, and got out the stone ballast and
                  wood, which brought the ship's draught of water to eight feet ten inches forward,
                  and thirteen feet abaft; and this I thought, with the difference that would be
                  made by trimming the coals aft, would be sufficient; for I found that the water
                  rose and fell perpendicularly eight feet at the spring-tides: but as soon as the
                  coals were trimmed from over the leak, we could hear the water rush in a little
                  abaft the foremast, about three feet from the keel: this determined me to clear
                  the hold intirely. This evening, Mr. Banks observed that in many parts of the
                  inlet there were large quantities of pumice stones, which lay at a considerable
                  distance above high-water mark; whither they might have been carried either by the
                  freshes or extraordinary high tides, for there could be no doubt but that they
                  came from the sea. </p><p n="955"><pb n="559"/>The next morning we went early to work,* and by four o'clock in the
                  afternoon had got out all the coals, cast the moorings loose, and warped the ship
                  a little higher up the harbour to a place which I thought most convenient for
                  laying her ashore in order to stop the leak. Her draught of water forward was now
                  seven feet nine inches, and abaft thirteen feet six inches. At eight o'clock, it
                  being high-water, I hauled her bow close ashore; but kept her stern afloat,
                  because I was afraid of neiping her; it was however necessary to lay the whole of
                  her as near the ground as possible. </p><p n="956">At two o'clock in the morning of the <date>22d</date>, the tide left her,* and gave us
                  an opportunity to examine the leak, which we found to be at her floor heads, a
                  little before the starboard fore-chains. In this place the rocks had made their
                  way through four planks, and even into the timbers; three more planks were much
                  damaged, and the appearance of these breaches was very extraordinary: there was
                  not a splinter to be seen, but all was as smooth, as if the whole had been cut
                  away by an instrument: the timbers in this place were happily very close, and if
                  they had not, it would have been absolutely impossible to have saved the ship. But
                  after all, her preservation depended upon a circumstance still more remarkable: in
                  one of the holes, which was big enough to have sunk us, if we had had eight pumps
                  instead of four, and been able to keep them incessantly going, was in great
                  measure plugged up by a fragment of the rock, which, after having made the wound,
                  was left sticking in it; so that the water which at first bad gained upon our
                  pumps, was what came in at the interstices, between the stone and the edges of the
                  hole that received it. We found also several pieces of the fothering, which had
                  made their way between the <pb n="560"/> timbers,* and in a great measure stopped
                  those parts of the leak which the stone had left open. Upon further examination,
                  we found that, besides the leak, considerable damage had been done to the bottom;
                  great part of the sheathing was gone from under the larboard bow; a considerable
                  part of the false keel was also wanting, and these indeed we had seen swim away in
                  fragments from the vessel, while she lay beating against the rock: the remainder
                  of it was in so shattered a condition that it had better have been gone, and the
                  fore foot and main keel were also damaged, but not so as to produce any immediate
                  danger: what damage she might have received abaft could not yet be exactly known,
                  but we had reason to think it was not much, as but little water made its way into
                  her bottom, while the tide kept below the leak which has already been described.
                  By nine o'clock in the morning the carpenters got to work upon her, while the
                  smiths were busy in making bolts and nails. In the mean time, some of the people
                  were sent on the other side of the water to shoot pigeons for the sick, who at
                  their return reported that they had seen an animal as large as a greyhound, of a
                  slender make, a mouse colour, and extremely swift; they discovered also many
                  Indian houses, and a fine stream of fresh water. </p><p n="957">*The next morning, I sent a boat to haul the seine; but at noon it
                  returned with only three fish, and yet we saw them in plenty leaping about the
                  harbour. This day the carpenter finished the repairs that were necessary on the
                  starboard side; and at nine o'clock in the evening, we heeled the ship the other
                  way, and hauled her off about two feet for fear of neiping. This day almost every
                  body had seen the animal which the pigeon-shooters had brought an account of the
                  day before; and one of the seamen, who had been rambling in the woods, told us at
                  his return, that he verily believed <!--Page  [unnumbered]--></p><p n="958">[illustration] <pb n="561"/> he had seen the devil:* we naturally enquired
                  in what form he had appeared, and his answer was in so singular a stile that I
                  shall set down his own words; He was, says John, as large as a one gallon keg, and
                  very like it; he had horns and wings, yet he crept so slowly through the grass,
                  that if I had not been afeard I might have touched him. This formidable apparition
                  we afterwards discovered to have been a batt; and the batts here must be
                  acknowledged to have a frightful appearance, for they are nearly black, and full
                  as large as a partridge; they have indeed no horns, but the fancy of a man who
                  thought he saw the devil might easily supply that defect. Early on the <date>24th</date>,* the
                  carpenters began to repair the sheathing under the larboard bow, where we found
                  two planks cut about half through; and in the mean time I sent a party of men,
                  under the direction of Mr. Gore, in search of refreshments for the sick: this
                  party returned about noon with a few palm cabbages, and a bunch or two of wild
                  plantains; the plantains were the smallest I had ever seen, and the pulp, though
                  it was well tasted, was full of small stones. As I was walking this morning at a
                  little distance from the ship, I saw myself one of the animals which had been so
                  often described▪ it was of a light mouse colour, and in size and shape very much
                  resembling a greyhound; it had a long tail also, which it carried like a
                  greyhound; and I should have taken it for a wild dog, if instead of running, it
                  had not leapt like a hare or deer: its legs were said to be very slender, and the
                  print of its foot to be like that of a goat; but where I saw it the grass was so
                  high that the legs were concealed, and the ground was too hard to receive the
                  track. Mr. Banks also had an imperfect view of this animal, and was of opinion
                  that its species was hitherto unknown. </p><p n="959"><pb n="562"/>*After the ship was hauled ashore, all the water that came into her
                  of course went backwards; so that although she was dry forward, she had nine feet
                  water abaft: as in this part therefore her bottom could not be examined on the
                  inside, I took the advantage of the tide being out this evening to get the master
                  and two of the men to go under her, and examine her whole larboard side without.
                  They found the sheathing gone about the floor heads abreast of the mainmast, and
                  part of a plank a little damaged; but all agreed that she had received no other
                  material injury. The loss of her sheathing alone was a great misfortune, as the
                  worm would now be let into her bottom, which might expose us to great
                  inconvenience and danger; but as I knew no remedy for the mischief but heaving her
                  down, which would be a work of immense labour and long time, if practicable at ail
                  in our present situation, I was obliged to be content. The carpenters however
                  continued to work under her bottom in the evening till they were prevented by the
                  tide; the morning tide did not ebb out far enough to permit them to work at all,
                  for we had only one tolerable high and low tide in four and twenty hours, as
                  indeed we had experienced when we lay upon the rock. The position of the ship,
                  which threw the water in her abaft, was very near depriving the world of all the
                  knowlege which Mr. Banks had endured so much labour, and so many risks, to
                  procure; for he had removed the curious collection of plants which he made during
                  the whole voyage, into the bread room, which lies in the after part of the ship,
                  as a place of the greatest security; and nobody having thought of the danger to
                  which laying her head so much higher than the stern would expose them, they were
                  this day found under water. Most of them however were, by indefatigable care and
                  attention, <pb n="563"/> restored to a state of preservation,* but some were
                  entirely spoilt and destroyed. </p><p n="960">The <date>25th</date> was employed in filling water and over-hauling the rigging,* and
                  at low water the carpenters finished the repairs under the larboard bow, and every
                  other place which the tide would permit them to come at; some casks were then
                  lashed under her bows to facilitate her floating, and at night, when it was high
                  water, we endeavoured to heave her off, but without success, for some of the casks
                  that were lashed to her gave way. </p><p n="961">The morning of the <date>26th</date> was employed in getting more casks ready for the
                  same purpose,* and in the afternoon we lashed no less than eight and thirty under
                  the ship's bottom, but to our great mortification these also proved ineffectual,
                  and we found ourselves reduced to the necessity of waiting till the next
                  spring-tide. </p><p n="962">This day, some of our gentlemen who had made an excursion into the woods,
                  brought home the leaves of a plant, which was thought to be the same that in the
                  West Indies is called coccos, but upon trial, the roots proved too acrid to be
                  eaten; the leaves however were little inferior to spinnage. In the place where
                  these plants were gathered, grew plenty of the cabbage traces which have
                  occasionally been mentioned before, a kind of wild plantain, the fruit of which
                  was so full of stones as scarcely to be eatable; another fruit was also found
                  about the size of a small golden pippin, but flatter, and of a deep purple colour:
                  when first gathered from the tree it was very hard and disagreeable, but after
                  being kept a few days became soft, and tasted very much like an indifferent
                  damascene. </p><p n="963">The next morning we began to move some of the weight from the after-part
                  of the ship forward, to ease her;* in the mean time the armourer continued to work
                  at the forge, the <pb n="564"/> carpenter was busy in caulking the ship,* and the
                  men employed in filling water and over-hauling the rigging: in the forenoon, I
                  went myself in the pinnace up the harbour, and made several hauls with the seine,
                  but caught only between twenty and thirty fish, which were given to the sick and
                  convalescent. </p><p n="964">*On the <date>28th</date>, Mr. Banks went with some of the seamen up the country, to
                  shew them the plant which in the West Indies is called Indian kalc, and which
                  served us for greens. Tupia had much meliorated the root of the coccos, by giving
                  them a long dressing in his country oven, but they were so small that we did not
                  think them an object for the ship. In their walk they found one tree which had
                  been notched for the convenience of climbing it, in the same manner with those we
                  had seen in Botany Bay: they saw also many nests of white ants, which resemble
                  those of the East Indies, the most pernicious insects in the world. The nests were
                  of a pyramidical figure, from a few inches to six feet high, and very much
                  resembled the stones in England, which are said to be monuments of the Druids. Mr.
                  Gore, who was also this day four or five miles up the country, reported that he
                  had seen the footsteps of men, and tracked animals of three or four different
                  sorts, but had not been fortunate enough to see either man or beast. </p><p n="965">*At two o'clock in the morning of the <date>29th</date>, I observed, in conjunction
                  with Mr. Green, an emersion of Jupiter's first satellite; the time here was 2• 18′
                  53″, which gave the longitude of this place <geo select="lon">214° 42′ 30″ W.</geo>: its
                  latitude is <geo select="lat">15° 26′ S</geo>. At break of day, I sent the boat out again with
                  the seine, and in the afternoon, it returned with as much fish as enabled me to
                  give every man a pound and an half. One of my midshipmen, an American, who was
                  this day abroad with his gun, reported that he had seen a wolf, exactly like those
                     <pb n="565"/> which he had been used to see in his own country,* and that he
                  had shot at it, but did not kill it. </p><p n="966">The next morning,* encouraged by the success of the day before, I sent the
                  boat again to haul the seine, and another party to gather greens: I sent also some
                  of the young gentlemen to take a plan of the harbour, and went myself upon a hill,
                  which lies over the south point, to take a view of the sea. At this time it was
                  low water, and I saw, with great concern, innumerable sand banks and shoals lying
                  all along the coast in every direction. The innermost lay about three or four
                  miles from the shore, the outermost extended as far as I could see with my glass,
                  and many of them did but just rise above water. There was some appearance of a
                  passage to the northward, and I had no hope of getting clear but in that
                  direction, for as the wind blows constantly from the S.E. it would have been
                  difficult, if not impossible, to return back to the southward. </p><p n="967">Mr. Gore reported, that he had this day seen two animals like dogs, of a
                  straw colour, that they ran like a hare, and were about the same size. In the
                  afternoon, the people returned from hauling the seine, with still better success
                  than before, for I was now able to distribute two pounds and an half to each man:
                  the greens that had been gathered I ordered to be boiled among the peas, and they
                  made an excellent mess, which, with two copious supplies of fish, afforded us
                  unspeakable refreshment. </p><p n="968">The next day, July the <date>1st</date>, being Sunday,* every body had liberty to go
                  ashore, except one from each mess, who were again sent out with the seine. The
                  seine was again equally successful, and the people who went up the country gave an
                  account of having seen several animals, though none of them were to be caught.
                  They saw a fire also about a mile <pb n="566"/> up the river,* and Mr. Gore, the
                  Second Lieutenant, picked up the husk of a cocoa nut, which had been cast upon the
                  beach, and was full of barnacles: this probably might come from some island to
                  windward, perhaps from the Terra del Espirito Santo of Quiros, as we were now in
                  the latitude where it is said to lie. This day the thermometer in the shade rose
                  to 87, which was higher than it had been on any day since we came upon this coast. </p><p n="969">*Early the next morning, I sent the Master in the pinnace, out of the
                  harbour, to sound about the shoals in the offing, and look for a channel to the
                  northward: at this time we had a breeze from the land, which continued till about
                  nine o'clock, and was the first we had had since our coming into the river. At low
                  water we lashed some empty casks under the ship's bows, having some hope that as
                  the tides were rising she would float the next high water. We still continued to
                  fish with great success, and at high water we again attempted to heave the ship
                  off, but our utmost efforts were still ineffectual. </p><p n="970">*The next day at noon, the Master returned, and reported, that he had
                  found a passage out to sea between the shoals, and described its situation. The
                  shoals, he said, consisted of coral rocks, many of which were dry at low water,
                  and upon one of which he had been ashore. He found here some cockles of so
                  enormous a size that one of them was more than two men could eat, and a great
                  variety of other shell-fish, of which he brought us a plentiful supply: in the
                  evening, he had also landed in a bay about three leagues to the northward of our
                  station, where he disturbed some of the natives who were at supper: they all fled
                  with the greatest precipitation at his approach, leaving some fresh sea eggs, and
                  a fire ready kindled behind them, but there was neither <pb n="567"/> house nor
                  hovel near the place. We observed,* that although the shoals that lie just within
                  sight of the coast, abound with shell-fish, which may be easily caught at low
                  water; yet we saw no such shells about the fire places on shore. This day an
                  allegator was seen to swim about the ship for some time, and at high water we made
                  another effort to float her, which happily succeeded: we found however that by
                  lying so long with her head a-ground, and her stern a-float, she had sprung a
                  plank between decks, a-breast of the main chains, so that it was become necessary
                  to lay her ashore again. </p><p n="971">The next morning was employed in trimming her upon an even keel, and in
                  the afternoon, having warped her over,* and waited for high water, we laid her
                  ashore on the sand bank on the south side of the river, for the damage she had
                  received already from the great descent of the ground, made me afraid to lay her
                  broad-side to the shore in the same place from which we had just floated her. I
                  was now very desirous to make another trial to come at her bottom, where the
                  sheathing had been rubbed off, but though she had scarcely four feet water under
                  her, when the tide was out, yet that part was not dry. </p><p n="972">On the <date>5th</date>, I got one of the carpenter's crew,* a man in whom I could
                  confide, to go down again to the ship's bottom, and examine the place. He
                  reported, that three streaks of the sheathing, about eight feet long, were
                  wanting, and that the main plank had been a little rubbed; this account perfectly
                  agreed with the report of the Master, and others, who had been under her bottom
                  before: I had the comfort however to find the carpenter of opinion that this would
                  be of little consequence, and therefore the other damage being repaired, she was
                  again floated at high water, and moored along-side the beach, where the stores had
                  been <pb n="568"/> deposited;* we then went to work to take the stores on board,
                  and put her in a condition for the sea. This day, Mr. Banks crossed to the other
                  side of the harbour, where, as he walked along a sandy beach, he found innumerable
                  fruits, and many of them such as no plants which he had discovered in this country
                  produced: among others were some cocoa nuts, which Tupia said had been opened by a
                  kind of crab, which from his description we judged to be the same that the Dutch
                  call Beurs Krabbe, and which we had not seen in these seas. All the vegetable
                  substances which he found in this place, were encrusted with marine productions,
                  and covered with barnacles; a sure sign that they must have come far by sea, and,
                  as the trade-wind blows right upon the shore, probably from Terra del Espirito
                  Santo, which has been mentioned already. </p><p n="973">*The next morning, Mr. Banks, with Lieutenant Gore, and three men, set out
                  in a small boat up the river, with a view to spend two or three days in an
                  excursion, to examine the country, and kill some of the animals which had been so
                  often seen at a distance. </p><p n="974">*On the <date>7th</date>, I sent the Master again out to sound about the shoals, the
                  account which he had brought me of a channel being by no means satisfactory; and
                  we spent the remainder of this day, and the morning of the next, in fishing, and
                  other necessary occupations. </p><p n="975">*About four o'clock in the afternoon, Mr. Banks and his party returned,
                  and gave us an account of their expedition. Having proceeded about three leagues
                  among swamps and mangroves, they went up into the country, which they found to
                  differ but little from what they had seen before: they pursued their course
                  therefore up the river, which at length was contracted into a narrow channel, and
                  was bounded, not by swamps and mangroves, but by steep <pb n="569"/> banks,* that
                  were covered with trees of a most beautiful verdure, among which was that which in
                  the West Indies is called Mohoe, or the bark tree, the hibiscus tiliaceus; the
                  land within was in general low, and had a thick covering of long grass: the soil
                  seemed to be such as promised great fertility, to any who should plant and improve
                  it. In the course of the day, Tupia saw an animal, which, by his description, Mr.
                  Banks judged to be a wolf: they also saw three other animals, but could neither
                  catch nor kill one of them, and a kind of bat, as large as a partridge, but this
                  also eluded all their diligence and skill. At night, they took up their lodging
                  close to the banks of the river, and made a fire, but the musquitos swarmed about
                  them in such numbers, that their quarters were almost untenable; they followed
                  them into the smoke, and almost into the fire, which, hot as the climate was, they
                  could better endure than the stings of these insects, which were an intolerable
                  torment. The fire, the flies, and the want of a better bed than the ground,
                  rendered the night extremely uncomfortable, so that they passed it not in sleep,
                  but in restless wishes for the return of day. With the first dawn they set out in
                  search of game, and in a walk of many miles, they saw four animals of the same
                  kind, two of which Mr. Banks's greyhound fairly chaced, but they threw him out at
                  a great distance, by leaping over the long thick grass, which prevented his
                  running: this animal was observed not to run upon four legs, but to bound or hop
                  forward upon two, like the Jerbua, or Mus Jaculus. About noon, they returned to
                  the boat, and again proceeded up the river, which was soon contracted into a fresh
                  water brook, where, however, the tide rose to a considerable height: as evening
                  approached, it became low water, and it was then so shallow that they were obliged
                  to get out of the boat and drag her along, till they could find a place in <pb n="570"/> which they might,* with some hope of rest, pass the night. Such a
                  place at length offered, and while they were getting the things out of the boat,
                  they observed a smoke at the distance of about a furlong: as they did not doubt
                  but that some of the natives, with whom they had so long and earnestly desired to
                  become personally acquainted, were about the fire, three of the party went
                  immediately towards it, hoping that so small a number would not put them to
                  flight: when they came up to the place, however, they found it deserted, and
                  therefore they conjectured that before they had discovered the Indians, the
                  Indians had discovered them. They found the fire still burning, in the hollow of
                  an old tree that was become touch-wood, and several branches of trees newly broken
                  down, with which children appeared to have been playing: they observed also many
                  foot-steps upon the sand, below high water mark, which were certain indications
                  that the Indians had been recently upon the spot. Several houses were found at a
                  little distance, and some ovens dug in the ground, in the same manner as those of
                  Otaheite, in which victuals appeared to have been dressed since the morning, and,
                  scattered about them, lay some shells of a kind of clamm, and some fragments of
                  roots, the refuse of the meal. After regretting their disappointment, they
                  repaired to their quarters, which was a broad sand bank, under the shelter of a
                  bush. Their beds were plantain leaves, which they spread upon the sand, and which
                  were as soft as a mattress; their cloaks served them for bed-clothes, and some
                  bunches of grass for pillows: with these accommodations they hoped to pass a
                  better night than the last, especially as, to their great comfort, not a musquito
                  was to be seen. Here then they lay down, and, such is the force of habit, they
                  resigned themselves to sleep, without once reflecting upon the probability and
                  danger of being found by the Indians in <pb n="571"/> that situation. If this
                  appears strange,* let us for a moment reflect, that every danger, and every
                  calamity, after a time becomes familiar, and loses its effect upon the mind. If it
                  were possible that a man should first be made acquainted with his mortality, or
                  even with the inevitable debility and infirmities of old age, when his
                  understanding had arrived at its full strength, and life was endeared by the
                  enjoyments of youth, and vigour, and health, with what an agony of terror and
                  distress would the intelligence be received! yet, being gradually acquainted with
                  these mournful truths, by insensible degrees, we scarce know when, they lose all
                  their force, and we think no more of the approach of old age and death, than these
                  wanderers of an unknown desart did of a less obvious and certain evil, the
                  approach of the native savages, at a time when they must have fallen an easy prey
                  to their malice or their fears. And it is remarkable, that the greater part of
                  those who have been condemned to suffer a violent death, have slept the night
                  immediately preceding their execution, though there is perhaps no instance of a
                  person accused of a capital crime having slept the first night of his confinement.
                  Thus is the evil of life in some degree a remedy for itself, and though every man
                  at twenty deprecates fourscore, almost every man is as tenacious of life at
                  fourscore as at twenty; and if he does not suffer under any painful disorder,
                  loses as little of the comforts that remain by reflecting that he is upon the
                  brink of the grave, where the earth already crumbles under his feet, as he did of
                  the pleasures of his better days, when his dissolution, though certain, was
                  supposed to be at a distance. </p><p n="976">Our travellers having slept, without once awaking, till the morning,
                  examined the river, and finding the tide savoured their return, and the country
                  promised nothing <pb n="572"/> worthy of a farther search,* they reimbarked in
                  their boat, and made the best of their way to the ship. </p><p n="977">Soon after the arrival of this party, the Master also returned, having
                  been seven leagues out to sea, and he was now of opinion, that there was no
                  getting out where before he thought there had been a passage; his expedition
                  however was by no means without its advantage, for having been a second time upon
                  the rock where he had seen the large cockles, he met with a great number of
                  turtle, three of which he caught, that together weighed seven hundred and
                  ninety-one pounds, though he had no better instrument than a boat hook. </p><p n="978">*The next morning therefore, I sent him out again, with proper instruments
                  for taking them, and Mr. Banks went with him, but the success did not at all
                  answer our expectations, for, by the unaccountable conduct of the officer, not a
                  single turtle was taken, nor could he be persuaded to return: Mr. Banks, however,
                  went ashore upon the reef, where he saw several of the large cockles, and having
                  collected many shells, and marine productions, he returned at eleven o'clock at
                  night, in his own small boat, the Master still continuing with the large one upon
                  the rock. In the afternoon, seven or eight of the natives had appeared on the
                  south side of the river, and two of them came down to the sandy point, opposite to
                  the ship; but upon seeing me put off in a boat to speak with them, they all ran
                  away with the greatest precipitation. </p><p n="979">As the Master continued absent with the boat all night, I was forced to
                  send the Second Lieutenant for him, early the next morning in the yawl;* and soon
                  after four of the natives appeared upon the sandy point, on the north side of the
                  river, having with them a small wooden canoe, with outriggers: <pb n="573"/> they
                  seemed for some time to be busily employed in striking fish:* some of our people
                  were for going over to them in a boat, but this I would by no means permit,
                  repeated experience having convinced me that it was more likely to prevent, than
                  procure an interview. I was determined to try what could be done by a contrary
                  method, and accordingly let them alone, without appearing to take the least notice
                  of them: this succeeded so well, that at length two of them came in the canoe
                  within a musket shot of the ship, and there talked a great deal in a very loud
                  tone: we understood nothing that they said, and therefore could answer their
                  harangue only by shouting, and making all the signs of invitation and kindness
                  that we could devise. During this conference, they came, insensibly, nearer and
                  nearer, holding up their lances, not in a threatening manner, but as if to
                  intimate that if we offered them any injury, they had weapons to revenge it. When
                  they were almost along-side of us, we threw them some cloth, nails, beads, paper,
                  and other trifles, which they received without the least appearance of
                  satisfaction: at last, one of the people happened to throw them a small fish; at
                  this they expressed the greatest joy imaginable, and intimating, by signs, that
                  they would fetch their companions, immediately paddled away towards the shore. In
                  the mean time some of our people, and among them Tupia, landed on the opposite
                  side of the river: the canoe, with all the four Indians, very soon returned to the
                  ship, and came quite along-side, without expressing any fear or distrust. We
                  distributed some more presents among them, and soon after they left us, and landed
                  on the same side of the river where our people had gone ashore: every man carried
                  in his hand two lances, and a stick, which is used in throwing them, and advanced
                  to <pb n="574"/> the place where Tupia and the rest of our people were sitting;*
                  Tupia soon prevailed upon them to lay down their arms, and come forward without
                  them: he then made signs that they should sit down by him, with which they
                  complied, and seemed to be under no apprehension or constraint: several more of us
                  then going ashore, they expressed some jealousy lest we should get between them
                  and their arms; we took care however to shew them that we had no such intention,
                  and having joined them, we made them some more presents, as a farther testimony of
                  our good-will, and our desire to obtain theirs. We continued together, with the
                  utmost cordiality, till dinner time, and then giving them to understand that we
                  were going to eat, we invited them, by signs, to go with us: this however they
                  declined, and as soon as we left them, they went away in their canoe. One of these
                  men was somewhat above the middle age, the other three were young; they were in
                  general of the common stature, but their limbs were remarkably small; their skin
                  was of the colour of wood soot, or what would be called a dark chocolate colour;
                  their hair was black, but not woolly; it was short cropped, in some lank, and in
                  others curled. Dampier says, that the people whom he saw on the western coast of
                  this country, wanted two of their fore-teeth, but these had no such defect: some
                  part of their bodies had been painted red, and the upper lip and breast of one of
                  them was painted with streaks of white, which he called Carbanda; their features
                  were far from disagreeable, their eyes were lively, and their teeth even and
                  white, their voices were soft and tuneable, and they repeated many words after us
                  with great facility. In the night, Mr. Gore and the Master returned with the
                  long-boat, and brought one turtle and a few shell-fish. The yawl had been left
                  upon the shoal with six men, to make a farther trial for turtle. </p><p n="980"><pb n="575"/>The next morning,* we had another visit from four of the natives;
                  three of them had been with us before, but the fourth was a stranger, whose name,
                  as we learnt from his companions who introduced him, was YAPARICO. This gentleman
                  was distinguished by an ornament of a very striking appearance: it was the bone of
                  a bird, nearly as thick as a man's finger, and five or six inches long, which he
                  had thrust into a hole, made in the gristle that divides the nostrils; of this we
                  had seen one instance, and only one, in New Zealand; but upon examination, we
                  found that among all these people this part of the nose was perforated, to receive
                  an ornament of the same kind: they had also holes in their ears, though nothing
                  was then hanging to them, and had bracelets upon the upper part of their arms,
                  made of plaited hair, so that, like the inhabitants of Terra del Fuego, they seem
                  to be fond of ornament, though they are absolutely without apparel; and one of
                  them, to whom I had given part of an old shirt, instead of throwing it over any
                  part of his body, tied it as a fillet round his head. They brought with them a
                  fish, which they gave us, as we supposed, in return for the fish that we had given
                  them the day before. They seemed to be much pleased, and in no haste to leave us,
                  but seeing some of our gentlemen examine their canoe with great curiosity and
                  attention, they were alarmed, and jumping immediately into it, paddled away
                  without speaking a word. </p><p n="981">About two the next morning, the yawl,* which had been left upon the shoal,
                  returned, with three turtles and a large skeat. As it seemed now probable that
                  this fishery might be prosecuted with advantage, I sent her out again, after
                  breakfast, for a further supply. Soon after, three Indians ventured down to
                  Tupia's tent, and were so well pleased with their reception, that one of them went
                  with the canoe to <pb n="576"/> fetch two others whom we had never seen:* when he
                  returned, he introduced the strangers by name, a ceremony which, upon such
                  occasions, was never omitted. As they had received the fish that was thrown into
                  their canoe, when they first approached the ship, with so much pleasure, some fish
                  was offered to them now, and we were greatly surprized to see that it was received
                  with the greatest indifference: they made signs, however, to some of the people,
                  that they should dress it for them, which was immediately done, but after eating a
                  little of it, they threw the rest to Mr. Banks's dog. They staid with us all the
                  forenoon, but would never venture above twenty yards from their canoe. We now
                  perceived that the colour of their skin was not so dark as it appeared, what we
                  had taken for their complexion, being the effects of dirt and smoke, in which, we
                  imagined, they contrived to sleep, notwithstanding the heat of the climate, as the
                  only means in their power to keep off the musquitos. Among other things that we
                  had given them when we first saw them, were some medals, which we had hung round
                  their necks by a riband; and these ribands were so changed by smoke, that we could
                  not easily distinguish of what colour they had been: this incident led us more
                  narrowly to examine the colour of their skin. While these people were with us, we
                  saw two others on the point of land that lay on the opposite side of the river, at
                  the distance of about two hundred yards, and by our glasses discovered them to be
                  a woman and a boy; the woman, like the rest, being stark naked. We observed, that
                  all of them were remarkably clean-limbed, and exceedingly active and nimble. One
                  of these strangers had a necklace of shells, very prettily made, and a bracelet
                  upon his arm, formed of several strings, so as to resemble what in England is
                  called gymp: both of them had a piece of bark tied over the forehead, and were
                  disfigured <pb n="577"/> by the bone in the nose.* We thought their language more
                  harsh than that of the Islanders in the South Sea, and they were continually
                  repeating the word chercau, which we imagined to be a term expressing admiration,
                  by the manner in which it was uttered: they also cried out, when they saw any
                  thing new, cher, tut, tut, tut, tut! which probably had a similar signification.
                  Their canoe was not above ten feet long, and very narrow, but it was fitted with
                  an outrigger, much like those of the islands, though in every respect very much
                  inferior: when it was in shallow water, they set it on with poles, and when in
                  deep, they worked it with paddles about four feet long: it contained just four
                  people, so that the people who visited us to-day went away at two turns. Their
                  lances were like those that we had seen in Botany Bay, except that they had but a
                  single point, which in some of them was the sting of the ray, and barbed with two
                  or three sharp bones of the same fish: it was indeed a most terrible weapon, and
                  the instrument which they used in throwing it, seemed to be formed with more art
                  than any we had seen before. About twelve o'clock next day,* the yawl returned,
                  with another turtle, and a large sting-ray, and in the evening, was sent out
                  again. </p><p n="982">The next morning, two of the Indians came on board,* but after a short
                  stay, went along the shore, and applied themselves with great diligence to the
                  striking of fish. Mr. Gore, who went out this day with his gun, had the good
                  fortune to kill one of the animals which had been so much the subject of our
                  speculation: an idea of it will best be conceived by the cut, plate XX, without
                  which, the most accurate verbal description would answer very little purpose, as
                  it has not similitude enough to any animal already known, to admit of illustration
                  by reference. In form, it is most <pb n="578"/> like the gerbua,* which it also
                  resembles in its motion, as has been observed already, but it greatly differs in
                  size, the gerbua not being larger than a common rat, and this animal, when full
                  grown, being as big as a sheep: this individual was a young one, much under its
                  full growth, weighing only thirty-eight pounds. The head, neck, and shoulders, are
                  very small in proportion to the other parts of the body; the tail is nearly as
                  long as the body, thick near the rump, and tapering towards the end: the fore-legs
                  of this individual were only eight inches long, and the hind-legs two and twenty:
                  its progress is by successive leaps or hops, of a great length, in an erect
                  posture; the fore-legs are kept bent close to the breast, and seemed to be of use
                  only for digging: the skin is covered with a short fur, of a dark mouse or grey
                  colour, excepting the head and ears, which bear a slight resemblance to those of a
                  hare. This animal is called by the natives Kanguroo. </p><p n="983">*The next day, our Kanguroo was dressed for dinner, and proved most
                  excellent meat; we might now indeed be said to fare sumptuously every day, for we
                  had turtle in great plenty, and we all agreed that they were much better than any
                  we had tasted in England, which we imputed to their being eaten fresh from the
                  sea, before their natural fat had been wasted, or their juices changed by a diet
                  and situation so different from what the sea affords them, as garbage and a tub.
                  Most of those that we caught here, were of the kind called green turtle, and
                  weighed from two to three hundred weight, and when these were killed, they were
                  always found to be full of turtle grass, which our naturalists took to be a kind
                  of conserva: two of them were loggerheads, the flesh of which was much less
                  delicious, and in their stomachs nothing was to be found but shells. </p><p n="984"><pb n="579"/>In the morning of the <date>16th</date>,* while the people were employed as usual
                  in getting the ship ready for the sea, I climbed one of the hills on the north
                  side of the river, from which I had an extensive view of the inland country, and
                  found it agreeably diversified by hills, vallies, and large plains, which in many
                  places were richly covered with wood. This evening, we observed an emersion of
                  Jupiter's first satellite, which gave <geo select="lon">214° 53′ 45″</geo> of longitude. The
                  observation which was made on the <date>29th of June</date> gave <geo select="lon">214° 42′ 30″</geo>; the
                  mean is <geo select="lon">214° 48′ 7½″</geo>, the longitude of this place west of Greenwich. </p><p n="985">On the <date>17th</date>,* I sent the Master and one of the Mates in the pinnace to
                  look for a channel to the northward; and I went myself with Mr. Banks and Dr.
                  Solander into the woods on the other side of the water. Tupia, who had been
                  thither by himself, reported, that he had seen three Indians who had given him
                  some roots about as thick as a man's finger, in shape not much unlike a rhadish,
                  and of a very agreeable taste. This induced us to go over, hoping that we should
                  be able to improve our acquaintance with the natives: in a very little time we
                  discovered four of them in a canoe, who as soon as they saw us came ashore, and,
                  though they were all strangers, walked up to us, without any signs of suspicion or
                  fear. Two of these had necklaces of shells, which we could not persuade them to
                  part with for any thing we could give them: we presented them however with some
                  beads, and after a short stay they departed. We attempted to follow them, hoping
                  that they would conduct us to some place where we should find more of them, and
                  have an opportunity of seeing their women; but they made us understand, by signs,
                  that they did not desire our company. </p><p n="986"><pb n="580"/>*At eight o'clock the next morning, we were visited by several of the
                  natives, who were now become quite familiar. One of them, at our desire, threw his
                  lance, which was about eight feet long: it flew with a swiftness and steadiness
                  that surprised us, and though it was never more than four feet from the ground, it
                  entered deeply into a tree at fifty paces distance. After this they ventured on
                  board, where I left them, to all appearance much entertained, and went again with
                  Mr. Banks to take a view of the country; but chiefly to indulge an anxious
                  curiosity, by looking round us upon the sea, of which our wishes almost persuaded
                  us we had formed an idea more disadvantageous than the truth. After having walked
                  about seven or eight miles along the shore to the northward, we ascended a very
                  high hill, and were soon convinced that the danger of our situation was at least
                  equal to our apprehensions; for in whatever direction we turned our eyes, we saw
                  rocks and shoals without number, and no passage out to sea, but through the
                  winding channels between them, which could not be navigated without the last
                  degree of difficulty and danger. We returned therefore to the ship, not in better
                  spirits than when we left it; we found several natives still on board, and we were
                  told that the turtles, of which we had then no less than twelve upon the deck, had
                  fixed their attention more than any thing else in the ship. </p><p n="987">*On the <date>19th</date> in the morning, we were visited by ten of the natives, the
                  greater part from the other side of the river, where we saw six or seven more,
                  most of them women, and like all the rest of the people we had seen in this
                  country, they were stark naked. Our guests brought with them a greater number of
                  lances than they had ever done before, and having laid them up in a tree, they set
                  a man and a boy to <pb n="581"/> watch them: the rest then came on board,* and we
                  soon perceived that they had determined to get one of our turtle, which was
                  probably as great a dainty to them as to us. They first asked us, by signs, to
                  give them one; and being refused, they expressed, both by looks and gestures,
                  great disappointment and anger. At this time we happened to have no victuals
                  dressed, but I offered one of them some biscuit, which he snatched and threw
                  overboard with great disdain. One of them renewed his request to Mr. Banks, and
                  upon a refusal stamped with his foot, and pushed him from him in a transport of
                  resentment and indignation: having applied by turns to almost every person who
                  appeared to have any command in the ship, without success, they suddenly seized
                  two of the turtles, and dragged them towards the side of the ship where their
                  canoe lay: our people soon forced them out of their hands, and replaced them with
                  the rest. They would not however relinquish their enterprise, but made several
                  other attempts of the same kind, in all which being equally disappointed, they
                  suddenly leaped into their canoe in a rage, and began to paddle towards the shore.
                  At the same time, I went into the boat with Mr. Banks, and five or six of the
                  ship's crew, and we got ashore before them, where many more of our people were
                  already engaged in various employments; as soon as they landed, they seized their
                  arms, and, before we were aware of their design, they snatched a brand from under
                  a pitch kettle which was boiling, and making a circuit to the windward of the few
                  things we had on shore, they set fire to the grass in their way, with surprising
                  quickness and dexterity: the grass, which was five or six feet high, and as dry as
                  stubble, burnt with amazing fury; and the fire made a rapid progress towards a
                  tent of Mr. Banks's, which had been set up for Tupia when he was sick, taking in
                  its course a sow and pigs, <pb n="582"/> one of which it scorched to death.* Mr.
                  Banks leaped into a boat, and fetched some people from on board, just time enough
                  to save his tent, by hauling it down upon the beach; but the smith's forge, at
                  least such part of it as would burn, was consumed. While this was doing, the
                  Indians went to a place at some distance, where several of our people were
                  washing, and where our nets, among which was the seine, and a great quantity of
                  linen, were laid out to dry; here they again set fire to the grass, entirely
                  disregarding both threats and entreaties. We were therefore obliged to discharge a
                  musquet, loaded with small shot, at one of them, which drew blood at the distance
                  of about forty yards, and this putting them to flight, we extinguished the fire at
                  this place before it had made much progress; but where the grass had been first
                  kindled, it spread into the woods to a great distance. As the Indians were still
                  in sight, I fired a musquet, charged with ball, abreast of them among the
                  mangroves, to convince them that they were not yet out of our reach: upon hearing
                  the ball they quickened their pace, and we soon lost sight of them. We thought
                  they would now give us no more trouble; but soon after we heard their voices in
                  the woods, and perceived that they came nearer and nearer. I set out, therefore,
                  with Mr. Banks and three or four more, to meet them: when our parties came in
                  sight of each other, they halted; except one old man, who came forward to meet us:
                  at length he stopped, and having uttered some words, which we were very sorry we
                  could not understand, he went back to his companions, and the whole body slowly
                  retreated. We found means however to seize some of their darts, and continued to
                  follow them about a mile: we then sat down upon some rocks, from which we could
                  observe their motions, and they also sat down at about an hundred yards distance.
                  After a short time, the old <pb n="583"/> man again advanced towards us,* carrying
                  in his hand a lance without a point: he stopped several times, at different
                  distances, and spoke; we answered by beckoning and making such signs of amity as
                  we could devise; upon which the messenger of peace, as we supposed him to be,
                  turned and spoke aloud to his companions, who then set up their lances against a
                  tree, and advanced towards us in a friendly manner: when they came up, we returned
                  the darts or lances that we had taken from them, and we perceived with great
                  satisfaction that this rendered the reconciliation complete. We found in this
                  party four persons whom we had never seen before, who as usual were introduced to
                  us by name; but the man who had been wounded in the attempt to burn our nets and
                  linen, was not among them; we knew however that he could not be dangerously hurt,
                  by the distance at which the shot reached him. We made all of them presents of
                  such trinkets as we had about us, and they walked back with us towards the ship:
                  as we went along, they told us, by signs, that they would not set fire to the
                  grass any more; and we distributed among them some musquet balls, and endeavoured
                  to make them understand their use and effect. When they came abreast of the ship,
                  they sat down, but could not be prevailed upon to come on board; we therefore left
                  them, and in about two hours they went away, soon after which we perceived the
                  woods on fire at about two miles distance. If this accident had happened a very
                  little while sooner, the consequence might have been dreadful; for our powder had
                  been aboard but a few days, and the store tent, with many valuable things which it
                  contained, had not been removed many hours. We had no idea of the fury with which
                  grass would burn in this hot climate, nor consequently of the difficulty of
                  extinguishing it; but we determined, that if it should ever again be necessary for
                     <pb n="584"/> us to pitch our tents in such a situation,* our first measure
                  should be to clear the ground round us. </p><p n="988">In the afternoon we got every thing on board the ship, new birthed her,
                  and let her swing with the tide; and at night the Master returned, with the
                  discouraging account that there was no passage for the ship to the northward. </p><p n="989">*The next morning, at low water, I went and sounded and buoyed the bar,
                  the ship being now ready for the sea. We saw no Indians this day, but all the
                  hills round us for many miles were on fire, which at night made a most striking
                  and beautiful appearance. </p><p n="990">*The <date>21st</date> passed without our getting sight of any of the inhabitants, and
                  indeed without a single incident worth notice.* On the <date>22d</date>, we killed a turtle for
                  the day's provision, upon opening which we found a wooden harpoon or turtle-peg,
                  about as thick as a man's finger, near fifteen inches long, and bearded at the
                  end, such as we had seen among the natives, sticking through both shoulders: it
                  appeared to have been struck a considerable time, for the wound had perfectly
                  healed up over the weapon. </p><p n="991">*Early in the morning of the <date>23d</date>, I sent some people into the country to
                  gather a supply of the greens which have been before mentioned by the name of
                  Indian Kale; and one of them having straggled from the rest, suddenly fell in with
                  four Indians, three men and a boy, whom he did not see till, by turning short in
                  the wood, he found himself among them. They had kindled a fire, and were broiling
                  a bird of some kind, and part of a Kanguroo, the remainder of which, and a
                  cockatoo, hung at a little distance upon a tree: the man, being unarmed, was at
                  first greatly terrified; but he had the presence of mind not to run away, judging
                  very <pb n="585"/> rightly,* that he was most likely to incur danger by appearing
                  to apprehend it; on the contrary, he went and sat down by them, and, with an air
                  of chearfulness and good humour, offered them his knife, the only thing he had
                  about him which he thought would be acceptable to them; they received it, and
                  having handed it from one to the other, they gave it him again: he then made an
                  offer to leave them; but this they seemed not disposed to permit: still however he
                  dissembled his fears, and sat down again; they considered him with great attention
                  and curiosity, particularly his clothes, and then felt his hands and face, and
                  satisfied themselves that his body was of the same texture with their own. They
                  treated him with the greatest civility, and having kept him about half an hour,
                  they made signs that he might depart: he did not wait for a second dismission, but
                  when he left them, not taking the direct way to the ship, they came from their
                  fire and directed him; so that they well knew whence he came. </p><p n="992">In the mean time, Mr. Banks, having made an excursion on the other side of
                  the river to gather plants, found the greatest part of the cloth that had been
                  given to the Indians lying in a heap together, probably as useless lumber, not
                  worth carrying away; and perhaps, if he had sought further, he might have found
                  the other trinkets; for they seemed to set very little value upon any thing we
                  had, except our turtle, which was a commodity that we were least able to spare. </p><p n="993">The blowing weather, which prevented our attempt to get out to sea, still
                  continuing,* Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander went again out on the <date>24th</date> to see whether
                  any new plant could be picked up: they traversed the woods all day without
                  success; but as they were returning through a deep valley, <pb n="586"/> the sides
                  of which,* though almost as perpendicular as a wall, were covered with trees and
                  bushes; they found lying upon the ground several marking nuts, the Anacardium
                  orientale; these put them upon a new scent, and they made a most diligent search
                  after the tree that bore them, which perhaps no European botanist ever saw; but to
                  their great mortification they could not find it: so that, after spending much
                  time, and cutting down four or five trees, they returned quite exhausted with
                  fatigue to the ship. </p><p n="994">*On the <date>25th</date>, having made an excursion up the river, I found a canoe
                  belonging to our friends the Indians, whom we had not seen since the affair of the
                  turtle; they had left it tied to some mangroves, about a mile distant from the
                  ship, and I could see by their fires that they were retired at least six miles
                  directly inland. </p><p n="995">*As Mr. Banks was again gleaning the country for his Natural History on
                  the <date>26th</date>, he had the good fortune to take an animal of the Opossum tribe: it was a
                  female, and with it he took two young ones: it was found much to resemble the
                  remarkable animal of the kind, which Mons. de Busson has described in his Natural
                  History by the name of Phalanger, but it was not the same. Mons. Busson supposes
                  this tribe to be peculiar to America, but in this he is certainly mistaken; and
                  probably, as Pallas has observed in his Zoology, the Phalanger itself is a native
                  of the East Indies, as the animal which was caught by Mr. Banks resembled it in
                  the extraordinary conformation of the feet, in which it differs from animals of
                  every other tribe. </p><p n="996">*On the <date>27th</date>, Mr. Gore shot a Kanguroo, which, with the skin, entrails,
                  and head, weighed eighty-four pounds. Upon examination, however, we found that
                  this animal was not at its full growth, the innermost grinders not being yet
                  formed. <pb n="587"/> We dressed it for dinner the next day;* but to our great
                  disappointment, we found it had a much worse flavour than that we had eaten
                  before. </p><p n="997">The wind continued in the same quarter, and with the same violence, till
                  five o'clock in the morning of the <date>29th</date>,* when it fell calm; soon after a light
                  breeze sprung up from the land, and it being about two hours ebb, I sent a boat to
                  see what water was upon the bar; in the mean time we got the anchor up, and made
                  all ready to put to sea. But when the boat came back, the officer reported that
                  there was only thirteen feet water upon the bar, which was six inches less than
                  the ship drew. We were therefore obliged to come to, and the sea breeze setting in
                  again about eight o'clock, we gave up all hope of sailing that day. </p><p n="998">We had fresh gales at S.E. with hazy weather and rain,* till two in the
                  morning of the <date>31st</date>, when the weather being something more moderate, I had
                  thoughts of trying to warp the ship out of the harbour; but upon going out myself
                  first in the boat, I found it still blow too fresh for the attempt. During all
                  this time the pinnace and yawl continued to ply the net and hook with tolerable
                  success; sometimes taking a turtle, and frequently bringing in from two to three
                  hundred weight of fish. </p><p n="999">On the <date>1st of August</date>, the carpenter examined the pumps,* and, to our great
                  mortification, found them all in a state of decay, owing, as he said, to the sap's
                  having been left in the wood; one of them was so rotten as, when hoisted up, to
                  drop to pieces, and the rest were little better; so that our chief trust was now
                  in the soundness of our vessel, which happily did not admit more than one inch of
                  water in an hour. </p><p n="1000"><pb n="588"/>*At six o'clock in the morning of Friday the <date>3d</date>, we made another
                  unsuccessful attempt to warp the ship out of the harbour; but at five o'clock in
                  the morning of the <date>4th</date>, our efforts had a better effect, and about seven, we got
                  once more under sail, with a light air from the land, which soon died away, and
                  was followed by the sea-breezes from S. E. by S. with which we stood off to sea,
                  E. by N. having the pinnace ahead, which was ordered to keep sounding continually.
                  The yawl had been sent to the turtle bank, to take up the net which had been left
                  there; but as the wind freshened, we got out before her. A little before noon we
                  anchored in fifteen fathom water, with a sandy bottom; for I did not think it safe
                  to run in among the shoals, till I had well viewed them, at low-water, from the
                  mast-head, which might determine me which way to steer: for as yet I was in doubt
                  whether I should beat back to the southward, round all the shoals, or seek a
                  passage to the eastward or the northward, all which at present appeared to be
                  equally difficult and dangerous. When we were at anchor the harbour from which we
                  sailed bore S. 70 W. distant about five leagues; the northermost point of the main
                  in sight, which I named CAPE BEDFORD, and which lies in latitude <geo select="lat" n="130">15° 16′
                     S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="130">214° 45′ W</geo>. bore N. 20 W. distant three leagues
                  and a half; but to the N. E. of this Cape we could see land which had the
                  appearance of two high islands: the turtle banks bore east, distant one mile: our
                  latitude by observation was <geo select="lat">15° 32′ S</geo>. and our depth of water in
                  standing off from the land was from three and an half to fifteen fathom. </p><p n="1001"><!--Page  [unnumbered]--></p><p n="1002">[illustration] CHART of Part of the COAST OF NEW SOUTH WALES, FROM CAPE

                  three or four leagues inland, and at the head of which there is a small brook of
                  fresh water: there is not depth of water for shipping above a mile within the bar,
                  and at this distance only on the north side, where the bank is so steep for near a
                  quarter of a mile, that a ship may lie afloat at low water, so near the shore as
                  to reach it with a stage, and the situation is extremely convenient for heaving
                  down; but at low water, the depth upon the bar is not more than nine or ten feet,
                  nor more than seventeen or eighteen at the height of the tide; the difference
                  between high and low water, at spring tides, being about nine feet. At the new and
                  full of the moon it is high water between nine and ten o'clock: it must also be
                  remembered, that this part of the coast is so barricaded with shoals, as to make
                  the harbour still more difficult of access; the safest approach is from the
                  southward, keeping the main land close upon the board all the way. Its situation
                  may always be found by the latitude, which has been very accurately <pb n="590"/>
                  laid down.* Over the south point is some high land, but the north point is formed
                  by a low sandy beach, which extends about three miles to the northward, where the
                  land begins again to be high. </p><p n="1005">The chief refreshment that we procured here, was turtle, but as they were
                  not to be had without going five leagues out to sea, and the weather was
                  frequently tempestuous, we did not abound with this dainty: what we caught, as
                  well as the fish, was always equally divided among us all by weight, the meanest
                  person on board having the same share as myself; and I think every commander, in
                  such a voyage as this, will find it his interest to follow the same rule. In
                  several parts of the sandy beaches, and sand hills near the sea, we found
                  purslain, and a kind of bean that grows upon a stalk, which creeps along the
                  ground: the purslain we found very good when it was boiled, and the beans are not
                  to be despised, for we found them of great service to our sick: the best greens,
                  however, that could be procured here, were the tops of the coccos, which have been
                  mentioned already, as known in the West Indies by the name of Indian kale: these
                  were, in our opinion, not much inferior to spinnage, which in taste they somewhat
                  resemble; the roots indeed are not good, but they might probably be meliorated by
                  proper cultivation. They are found here chiefly in boggy ground. The few cabbage
                  palms that we met with, were in general small, and yielded so little cabbage that
                  they were not worth seeking. </p><p n="1006">Besides the kanguroo, and the opossum that have been already mentioned,
                  and a kind of polecat, there are wolves upon this part of the coast, if we were
                  not deceived by the tracks upon the ground, and several species of serpents; some
                  of the serpents are venomous, and some harmiless: <pb n="591"/> there are no tame
                  animals here except dogs,* and of these we saw but two or three, which frequently
                  came about the tents, to pick up the scraps and bones that happened to lie
                  scattered near them. There does not indeed seem to be many of any animal, except
                  the kanguroo; we scarcely saw any other above once, but this we met with almost
                  every time we went into the woods. Of land fowls we saw crows, kites, hawks,
                  cockatoos of two sorts, one white and the other black, a very beautiful kind of
                  loriquets, some parrots, pigeons of two or three sorts, and several small birds
                  not known in Europe. The water fowls are herns, whistling ducks, which perch, and,
                  I believe, roost upon trees, wild geese, curlieus, and a few others, but these do
                  not abound. The face of the country, which has been occasionally mentioned before,
                  is agreeably diversified by hill and valley, lawn and wood. The soil of the hills
                  is hard, dry, and stony, yet it produces coarse grass besides wood: the soil of
                  the plains and vallies is in some places sand, and in some clay; in some also it
                  is rocky and stony, like the hills; in general, however, it is well clothed, and
                  has at least the appearance of fertility. The whole country, both hill and valley,
                  wood and plain, abounds with ant hills, some of which are six or eight feet high,
                  and twice as much in circumference. The trees here are not of many sorts; the gum
                  tree, which we found on the southern part of the coast, is the most common, but
                  here it is not so large: on each side of the river, through its whole course,
                  there are mangroves in great numbers, which in some places extend a mile within
                  the coast. The country is in all parts well watered, there being several fine
                  rivulets at a small distance from each other, but none in the place where we lay,
                  at least not during the time we were there, which was the dry season; we were
                  however well supplied with water by springs, which were not far off. </p><p n="1007"><pb n="592"/>*In the afternoon of the <date>4th</date>, we had a gentle breeze at S.E. and
                  clear weather, but as I did not intend to sail till the morning, I sent all the
                  boats to the reef, to get what turtle and shell fish they could. At low water, I
                  went up to the mast-head, and took a view of the shoals, which made a very
                  threatening appearance: I could see several at a remote distance, and part of many
                  of them was above water. The sea appeared most open to the north east of the
                  turtle reef, and I came to a resolution to stretch out that way close upon a wind,
                  because if we should find no passage, we could always return the way we went. In
                  the evening, the boats brought in a turtle, a sting-ray, and as many large cockles
                  as came to about a pound and a half a man, for in each of them there was not less
                  than two pounds of meat: in the night also we caught several sharks, which, though
                  not a dainty, were an acceptable increase of our fresh provision. </p><p n="1008">*In the morning, I waited till half ebb before I weighed, because at that
                  time the shoals begin to appear, but the wind then blew so hard that I was obliged
                  to remain at anchor: in the afternoon, however, the gale becoming more moderate,
                  we got under sail, and stood out upon a wind N. E. by E. leaving the turtle reef
                  to windward, and having the pinnace sounding ahead: we had not kept this course
                  long, before we discovered shoals before us, and upon both the bows; and at half
                  an hour after four, having run about eight miles, the pinnace made the signal for
                  shoal water, where we little expected it: upon this we tacked, and stood on and
                  off, while the pinnace stretched farther to the eastward, and night approaching, I
                  came to an anchor in twenty fathom water, with a muddy bottom. Endeavour River
                  then bore S. 52 W. Cape Bedford W. by N. ½ N. distant five leagues, the
                  northermost land in sight, which had the appearance of an island, N.; and a shoal,
                  a small sandy part <pb n="593"/> of which appeared above water,* bore N. E.
                  distant between two and three miles: in standing off from turtle reef to this
                  place, we had from fourteen to twenty fathom water, but when the pinnace was about
                  a mile farther to the E. N. E. there was no more than four or five feet water,
                  with rocky ground; and yet this did not appear to us in the ship. In the morning
                  of the <date>6th</date>, we had a strong gale,* so that instead of weighing, we were obliged to
                  veer away more cable, and strike our top-gallant yards. At low water, myself, with
                  several of the officers, kept a look-out at the mast-head, to see if any passage
                  could be discovered between the shoals, but nothing was in view except breakers,
                  extending from the S. round by the E. as far as N. W. and out to sea beyond the
                  reach of our sight; these breakers, however, did not appear to be caused by one
                  continued shoal, but by several, which lay detached from each other: on that which
                  lay farthest to the eastward, the sea broke very high, which made me think it was
                  the outermost, for upon many of these within, the breakers were inconsiderable,
                  and from about half ebb to half flood, they were not to be seen at all, which
                  makes sailing among them still more dangerous, especially as the shoals here
                  consist principally of coral rocks, which are as steep as a wall; upon some of
                  them however, and generally at the north end, there are patches of sand, which are
                  covered only at high water, and which are to be discerned at some distance. Being
                  now convinced that there was no passage to sea, but through the labyrinth formed
                  by these shoals, I was altogether at a loss which way to steer, when the weather
                  should permit us to get under sail. It was the Master's opinion, that we should
                  beat back the way we came, but this would have been an endless labour, as the wind
                  blew strongly from that quarter▪ almost without intermission; on the other hand,
                  if no passage could be found to <pb n="594"/> the northward,* we should be
                  compelled to take that measure at last. These anxious deliberations engaged us
                  till eleven o'clock at night, when the ship drove, and obliged us to veer away to
                  a cable and one third, which brought her up; but in the morning,* the gale
                  increasing, she drove again, and we therefore let go the small bower, and veered
                  away to a whole cable upon it, and two cables on the other anchors, yet she still
                  drove, though not so fast; we then got down top-gallant masts, and struck the
                  yards and top-masts close down, and at last had the satisfaction to find that she
                  rode. Cape Bedford now bore W. S. W. distant three leagues and an half, and in
                  this situation we had shoals to the eastward, extending from the S. E. by S. to
                  the N. N. W. the nearest of which was about two miles distant.* As the gale
                  continued, with little remission, we rode till seven o'clock in the morning of the
                  <date>10th</date>, when, it being more moderate, we weighed, and stood in for the land, having
                  at length determined to seek a passage along the shore to the northward, still
                  keeping the boat ahead: during our run in we had from nineteen to twelve fathom:
                  after standing in about an hour, we edged away for three small islands that lay N.
                  N. E. ½ E. three leagues from Cape Bedford, which the Master had visited while we
                  were in port. At nine o'clock, we were abreast of them, and between them and the
                  main: between us and the main there was another low island, which lies N. N. W.
                  four miles from the three islands; and in this channel we had fourteen fathom
                  water. The northermost point of land in sight now bore N. N. W. ½ W. distant about
                  two leagues. Four or five leagues to the north of this head land, we saw three
                  islands, near which lay some that were still smaller, and we could see the shoals
                  and reefs without us, extending to the northward, as far as these islands: between
                  these reefs and the head land, we directed our course, <pb n="595"/> leaving to
                  the eastward a small island,* which lies N. by E. distant four miles from the
                  three islands. At noon, we were got between the head land and the three islands:
                  from the head land we were distant two leagues, and from the islands four; our
                  latitude, by observation, was <geo select="lat">14° 51′</geo>. We now thought we saw a clear
                  opening before us, and hoped hat we were once more out of danger; in this hope,
                  however, we soon found ourselves disappointed, and for that reason I called the
                  head land CAPE FLATTERY. It lies in latitude <geo select="lat" n="131">14° 56′ S</geo>. longitude
                  <geo select="lon" n="131">214′ 43′ W</geo>. and is a lofty promontory, making next the sea in two
                  hills, which have a third behind them, with low sandy ground on each side: it may
                  however be still better known by the three islands out at sea: the northermost and
                  largest lies about five leagues from the Cape, in the direction of N. N. E. From
                  Cape Flattery the land trends away N. W. and N. W. by W. We steered along the
                  shore N. W. by W. till one o'clock, for what we thought the open channel, when the
                  petty officer at the mast-head cried out that he saw land ahead, extending quite
                  round to the islands that lay without us, and a large reef between us and them:
                  upon this I ran up to the mast-head myself, from whence I very plainly saw the
                  reef, which was now so far to windward, that we could not weather it, but the land
                  ahead, which he had supposed to be the main, appeared to me to be only a cluster
                  of small islands. As soon as I got down from the mast-head, the Master, and some
                  others went up, who all insisted that the land ahead was not islands, but the
                  main, and to make their report still more alarming, they said that they saw
                  breakers all round us. In this dilemma, we hauled upon a wind in for the land, and
                  made the signal for the boat that was sounding ahead to come on board, but as she
                  was far to leeward, we were obliged to edge away to take her up, and soon after we
                  came to an anchor, under a <pb n="596"/> point of the main,* in somewhat less than
                  five fathom, and at about the distance of a mile from the shore. Cape Flattery now
                  bore S. E. distant three leagues and an half. As soon as the ship was at anchor, I
                  went ashore upon the point, which is high, and afforded me a good view of the sea
                  coast, trending away N. W. by W. eight or ten leagues, which, the weather not
                  being very clear, was as far as I could see. Nine or ten small low islands, and
                  some shoals, appeared off the coast; I saw also some large shoals between the main
                  and the three high islands, without which, I was clearly of opinion there were
                  more islands, and not any part of the main. Except the point I was now upon, which
                  I called POINT LOOKOUT, and Cape Flattery, the main land, to the northward of Cape
                  Bedford, is low, and chequered with white sand and green bushes, for ten or twelve
                  miles inland, beyond which it rises to a considerable height. To the northward of
                  Point Look-out, the coast appeared to be shoal and flat, for a considerable
                  distance, which did not encourage the hope that the channel we had hitherto found
                  in with the land would continue. Upon this point, which was narrow, and consisted
                  of the finest white sand we had ever seen, we discovered the footsteps of people,
                  and we saw also smoke and fire at a distance up the country. </p><p n="1009">In the evening, I returned to the ship, and resolved the next morning to
                  visit one of the high islands in the offing, from the top of which, as they lay
                  five leagues out to sea, I hoped to discover more distinctly the situation of the
                  shoals, and the channel between them. </p><p n="1010">*In the morning therefore, of the <date>11th</date>, I set out in the pinnace,
                  accompanied by Mr. Banks, whose fortitude and curiosity made him a party in every
                  expedition, for the northermost and largest of the three islands, and at the same
                  time I <pb n="597"/> sent the Master in the yawl to leeward,* to found between the
                  low islands and the main. In my way, I passed over a reef of coral rock and sand,
                  which lies about two leagues from the island, and I left another to leeward, which
                  lies about three miles from it: on the north part of the reef, to the leeward,
                  there is a low sandy island, with trees upon it; and upon the reef which we passed
                  over, we saw several turtle: we chased one or two, but having little time to
                  spare, and the wind blowing fresh, we did not take any. </p><p n="1011">About one o'clock, we reached the island, and immediately ascended the
                  highest hill, with a mixture of hope and fear, proportioned to the importance of
                  our business, and the uncertainty of the event: when I looked round, I discovered
                  a reef of rocks, lying between two and three leagues without the islands, and
                  extending in a line N. W. and S. E. farther than I could see, upon which the sea
                  broke in a dreadful surf; this however made me think that there were no shoals
                  beyond them, and I conceived hopes of getting without these, as I perceived
                  several breaks or openings in the reef, and deep water between that and the
                  islands. I continued upon this hill till sunset, but the weather was so hazy
                  during the whole time that I came down much disappointed. After reflecting upon
                  what I had seen, and comparing the intelligence I had gained with what I expected,
                  I determined to stay upon the island all night, hoping that the morning might be
                  clearer, and afford me a more distinct and comprehensive view. We therefore took
                  up our lodging under the shelter of a bush which grew upon the beach, and at three
                  in the morning,* having sent the pinnace with one of the Mates whom I had brought
                  out with me, to sound between the island and the reefs, and examine what appeared
                  to be a channel through them, I climbed the hill a second time; but to my great
                  disappointment found the weather much more <pb n="598"/> hazy than it had been the
                  day before.* About noon the pinnace returned, having been as far as the reef, and
                  found between fifteen and twenty-eight fathom of water; but it blew so hard that
                  the Mate did not dare to venture into one of the channels, which he said appeared
                  to him to be very narrow: this however did not discourage me, for I judged from
                  his description of the place he had been at, that he had seen it to disadvantage.
                  While I was busy in my survey, Mr. Banks was attentive to his favourite pursuit,
                  and picked up several plants which he had not before seen. We found the island,
                  which is visible at twelve leagues distance, to be about eight leagues in
                  circumference, and in general very rocky and barren. On the north west side,
                  however, there are some sandy bays, and some low land, which is covered with long
                  thin grass, and trees of the same kind with those upon the main: this part also
                  abounded with lizards of a very large size, some of which we took. We found also
                  fresh water in two places; one was a running stream, but that was a little
                  brackish where I tasted it, which was close to the sea; the other was a standing
                  pool, close behind the sandy beach, and this was perfectly sweet and good.
                  Notwithstanding the distance of this island from the main, we saw, to our great
                  surprize, that it was sometimes visited by the natives; for we found seven or
                  eight frames of their huts, and vast heaps of shells, the fish of which we
                  supposed had been their food. We observed that all these huts were built upon
                  eminences, and entirely exposed to the S. E. contrary to those which we had seen
                  upon the main; for they were all built either upon the side of a hill, or under
                  some bushes which afforded them shelter from the wind. From these huts, and their
                  situation, we concluded that at some seasons of the year the weather here is
                  invariably calm and fine; for the inhabitants have no boat which can navigate the
                  sea to <pb n="599"/> so great a distance,* in such weather as we had from the time
                  of our first coming upon the coast. As we saw no animals upon this place but
                  lizards, I called it LIZARD ISLAND; the other two high islands, which lie at the
                  distance of four or five miles from it, are comparatively small; and near them lie
                  three others smaller still, and low, with several shoals or reefs, especially to
                  the S. E.: there is however a clear passage from Cape Flattery to these islands,
                  and even quite to the outward reefs, leaving Lizard Island to the north west, and
                  the others to the south east. </p><p n="1012">At two in the afternoon, there being no hope of clear weather, we set out
                  from Lizard Island to return to the ship, and in our way landed upon the low sandy
                  island with trees upon it, which we had remarked in our going out. Upon this
                  island we saw an incredible number of birds, chiefly sea-fowl: we found also the
                  nest of an eagle with young ones, which we killed; and the nest of some other
                  bird, we knew not what, of a most enormous size; it was built with sticks upon the
                  ground, and was no less than six and twenty feet in circumference, and two feet
                  eight inches high. We found also that this place had been visited by the Indians,
                  probably to eat turtle, many of which we saw upon the island, and a great number
                  of their shells, piled one upon another in different places. </p><p n="1013">To this spot we gave the name of EAGLE ISLAND, and after leaving it, we
                  steered S. W. directly for the ship, founding all the way, and we had never less
                  than eight fathom, nor more than fourteen; the same depth of water that I had
                  found between this and Lizard Island. </p><p n="1014">When I got on board, the Master informed me that he had been down to the
                  low islands, between which and the main I had directed him to found; that he
                  judged them to lie <pb n="600"/> about three leagues from the main;* that without
                  them he found from ten to fourteen fathom, and between them and the main seven:
                  but that a flat which ran two leagues out from the main, made this channel narrow.
                  Upon one of these low islands he slept, and was ashore upon others; and he
                  reported, that he saw every where piles of turtle-shells, and fins hanging upon
                  the trees in many places, with the flesh upon them, so recent, that the boat's
                  crew eat of them: he saw also two spots, clear of grass, which appeared to have
                  been lately dug up, and from the shape and size of them he conjectured they were
                  graves. </p><p n="1015">After considering what I had seen myself, and the report of the Master, I
                  was of opinion that the passage to leeward would be dangerous, and that, by
                  keeping in with the main, we should run the risk of being locked in by the great
                  reef, and at last be compelled to return back in search of another passage, by
                  which, or any other accident that should cause the same delay, we should
                  infallibly lose our passage to the East Indies, and endanger the ruin of the
                  voyage, as we had now but little more than three months provisions on board at
                  short allowance. </p><p n="1016">Having stated this opinion, and the facts and appearances upon which it
                  was founded, to the officers, it was unanimously agreed, that the best thing we
                  could do would be to quit the coast altogether, till we could approach it with
                  less danger. </p><p n="1017">*In tne morning therefore, at break of day, we got under sail, and stood
                  out N. E. for the north west end of Lizard Island, leaving Eagle Island to
                  windward, and some other islands and shoals to the leeward, and having the pinnace
                  ahead to ascertain the depth of water in every part of our course. In this channel
                  we had from nine to fourteen fathom. <pb n="601"/> At noon,* the north west end of
                  Lizard Island bore E. S. E. distant one mile; our latitude by observation was
                  <geo select="lat">14° 38′</geo>, and our depth of water fourteen fathom. We had a steady
                  gale at S. E. and by two o'clock we just fetched to windward of one of the
                  channels or openings in the outer reef, which I had seen from the island. We now
                  tacked, and made a short trip to the S. W. while the Master in the pinnace
                  examined the channel: he soon made the signal for the ship to follow, and in a
                  short time she got safe out. As soon as we had got without the breakers, we had no
                  ground with one hundred and fifty fathom, and found a large sea rolling in from
                  the S. E. a certain sign that neither land nor shoals were near us in that
                  direction. </p><p n="1018">Our change of situation was now visible in every countenance, for it was
                  most sensibly felt in every breast: we had been little less than three months
                  entangled among shoals and rocks, that every moment threatened us with
                  destruction; frequently passing our nights at anchor within hearing of the surge
                  that broke over them; sometimes driving towards them even while our anchors were
                  out, and knowing that if by any accident, to which an almost continual tempest
                  exposed us, they should not hold, we must in a few minutes inevitably perish. But
                  now, after having sailed no less than three hundred and sixty leagues, without
                  once having a man out of the chains heaving the lead, even for a minute, which
                  perhaps never happened to any other vessel, we found ourselves in an open sea,
                  with deep water; and enjoyed a flow of spirits which was equally owing to our late
                  dangers and our present security: yet the very waves, which by their swell
                  convinced us that we had no rocks or shoals to fear, convinced us also that we
                  could not safely put the same confidence in our vessel as before she had struck;
                  for the blows <pb n="602"/> she received from them so widened her leaks,* that she
                  admitted no less than nine inches water in an hour, which, considering the state
                  of our pumps, and the navigation that was still before us, would have been a
                  subject of more serious consideration, to people whose danger had not so lately
                  been so much more imminent. </p><p n="1019">The passage or channel, through which we passed into the open sea beyond
                  the reef, lies in latitude <geo select="lat">14° 32′ S</geo>. and may always be known by the
                  three high islands within it, which I have called the ISLANDS OF DIRECTION,
                  because by these a stranger may find a safe passage through the reef quite to the
                  main. The channel lies from Lizard Island N. E. ½ N. distant three leagues, and is
                  about one third of a mile broad, and not more in length. Lizard Island which is,
                  as I have before observed, the largest and the northermost of the three, affords
                  safe anchorage under the north west side, fresh water, and wood for fuel. The low
                  islands and shoals also which lie between it and the main abound with turtle and
                  fish, which may probably be caught in all seasons of the year, except when the
                  weather is very tempestuous; so that, all things considered, there is not perhaps
                  a better place for ships to refresh at upon the whole coast than this island. And
                  before I dismiss it, I must observe, that we found upon it, as well as upon the
                  beach in and about Endeavour River, bamboos, cocoa nuts, pumice stone, and the
                  seeds of plants which are not the produce of this country, and which it is
                  reasonable to suppose are brought from the eastward by the trade winds. The
                  islands which were discovered by Quiros, and called Australia del Espiritu Santa,
                  lie in this parallel; but how far to the eastward cannot now be ascertained: in
                  most charts they are placed in the same longitude with this country, which, as
                  appears by the account of his voyage <pb n="603"/> that has been published,* he
                  never saw; for that places his discoveries no less than two and twenty degrees to
                  the eastward of it. </p><p n="1020">As soon as we were without the reef, we brought to, and having hoisted in
                  the boats, we stood off and on upon a wind all night; for I was not willing to run
                  to leeward till I had a whole day before me.* In the morning, at day-break, Lizard
                  Island bore S. 15 E. distant ten leagues; and we then made sail and stood away
                  N.N.W. ½ W. till nine o'clock, when we stood N.W. ½ N. having the advantage of a
                  fresh gale at S.E. At noon, our latitude by observation was <geo select="lat">13° 46′ S</geo>.
                  and at this time we had no land in sight. At six in the evening we shortened sail
                  and brought the ship to, with her head to the N.E.; and at six in the morning made
                  sail and steered west,* in order to get within sight of the land, that I might be
                  sure not to overshoot the passage, if a passage there was, between this land and
                  New Guinea. At noon, our latitude by observation was <geo select="lat" n="132">13° 2′ S</geo>.,
                  longitude <geo select="lon" n="132">216° W</geo>.; which was <geo select="lon">1° 23′ W</geo>. of Lizard Island: at
                  this time we had no land in sight; but a little before one o'clock, we saw high
                  land from the mast-head, bearing W.S.W. At two, we saw more land to the N. W. of
                  that we had seen before: it appeared in hills, like islands; but we judged it to
                  be a continuation of the main land. About three, we discovered breakers between
                  the land and the ship, extending to the southward farther than we could see; but
                  to the north we thought we saw them terminate abreast of us. What we took for the
                  end of them in this direction, however, soon appeared to be only an opening in the
                  reef; for we presently saw them again, extending northward beyond the reach of our
                  sight. Upon this we hauled close upon a wind, which was now at E. S. E. and we had
                  scarcely trimmed our sails before it came to E. by N. which was right upon the
                  reef, and consequently made our clearing <pb n="604"/> it doubtful.* At sunset the
                  northermost part of it that was in sight bore from us N. by E. and was two or
                  three leagues distant; this however being the best tack to clear it, we kept
                  standing to the northward with all the sail we could set till midnight; when,
                  being afraid of standing too far in this direction, we tacked and stood to the
                  southward, our run from sunset to this time being six leagues N. and N. by E. When
                  we had stood about two miles S. S. E. it fell calm; we had sounded several times
                  during the night, but had no bottom with one hundred and forty fathom, neither had
                  we any ground now with the same length of line; yet, about four in the morning,*
                  we plainly heard the roaring of the surf, and at break of day saw it foaming to a
                  vast height, at not more than a mile's distance. Our distress now returned upon us
                  with double force; the waves which rolled in upon the reef, carried us towards it
                  very fast; we could reach no ground with an anchor, and had not a breath of wind
                  for the sail. In this dreadful situation, no resource was left us but the boats;
                  and to aggravate our misfortune the pinnace was under repair: the longboat and
                  yawl however were put into the water, and sent ahead to tow, which, by the help of
                  our sweeps abaft, got the ship's head round to the northward; which, if it could
                  not prevent our destruction, might at least delay it. But it was six o'clock
                  before this was effected, and we were not then a hundred yards from the rock upon
                  which the same billow which washed the side of the ship, broke to a tremendous
                  height the very next time it rose; so that between us and destruction there was
                  only a dreary valley, no wider than the base of one wave, and even now the sea
                  under us was unfathomable, at least no bottom was to be found with a hundred and
                  twenty fathom. During this scene of distress the carpenter had found means to
                  patch up the pinnace; so that she was <pb n="605"/> hoisted out, and sent ahead,
                  in aid of the other boats, to tow;* but all our efforts would have been
                  ineffectual, if, just at this crisis of our fate, a light air of wind had not
                  sprung up, so light, that at any other time we should not have observed it, but
                  which was enough to turn the scale in our favour, and, in conjunction with the
                  assistance which was afforded us by the boats, to give the ship a perceptible
                  motion obliquely from the reef. Our hopes now revived; but in less than ten
                  minutes it was again a dead calm, and the ship was again driven towards the
                  breakers, which were not now two hundred yards distant. The same light breeze
                  however returned before we had lost all the ground it had enabled us to gain, and
                  lasted about ten minutes more. During this time we discovered a small opening in
                  the reef, at about the distance of a quarter of a mile: I immediately sent one of
                  the Mates to examine it, who reported that its breadth was not more than the
                  length of the ship, but that within it there was smooth water: this discovery
                  seemed to render our escape possible, and that was all, by pushing the ship
                  through the opening, which was immediately attempted. It was uncertain indeed
                  whether we could reach it; but if we should succeed thus far, we made no doubt of
                  being able to get through: in this however we were disappointed, for having
                  reached it by the joint assistance of our boats and the breeze, we found that in
                  the mean time it had become high water, and to our great surprize we met the tide
                  of ebb rushing out of it like a mill-stream. We gained however some advantage,
                  though in a manner directly contrary to our expectations; we found it impossible
                  to go through the opening, but the stream that prevented us, carried us out about
                  a quarter of a mile: it was too narrow for us to keep in it longer; yet this tide
                  of ebb so much assisted the boats that by noon we had got an offing of near two
                     <pb n="606"/> miles.* We had, however, reason to despair of deliverance, even
                  if the breeze, which had now died away, should revive, for we were still embayed
                  in the reef; and the tide of ebb being spent, the tide of flood, notwithstanding
                  our utmost efforts, again drove the ship into the bight. About this time, however,
                  we saw another opening, near a mile to the westward, which I immediately sent the
                  First Lieutenant, Mr. Hicks, in the small boat to examine: in the mean time we
                  struggled hard with the flood, sometimes gaining a little, and sometimes losing;
                  but every man still did his duty, with as much calmness and regularity as if no
                  danger had been near. About two o'clock, Mr. Hicks returned with an account that
                  the opening was narrow and dangerous, but that it might be passed: the possibility
                  of passing it was sufficient encouragement to make the attempt, for all danger was
                  less imminent than that of our present situation. A light breeze now sprung up at
                  E. N. E. with which, by the help of our boats, and the very tide of flood that
                  without an opening would have been our destruction, we entered it, and were
                  hurried through with amazing rapidity, by a torrent that kept us from driving
                  against either side of the channel, which was not more than a quarter of a mile in
                  breadth. While we were shooting this gulph, our soundings were from thirty to
                  seven fathom, very irregular, and the ground at bottom very foul. </p><p n="1021">As soon as we had got within the reef we anchored in nineteen fathom,
                  over a bottom of coral and shells. And now, such is the vicissitude of life, we
                  thought ourselves happy in having regained a situation, which but two days before
                  it was the utmost object of our hope to quit. Rocks and shoals are always
                  dangerous to the mariner, even where their situation has been ascertained; they
                  are more dangerous in seas which have never before been navigated, and in <pb n="607"/> this part of the globe they are more dangerous than in any other; for
                  here they are reefs of coral rock,* rising like a wall almost perpendicularly out
                  of the unfathomable deep, always overflowed at high-water, and at low-water dry in
                  many places; and here the enormous waves of the vast Southern Ocean, meeting with
                  so abrupt a resistance, break, with inconceivable violence, in a surf which no
                  rocks or storms in the northern hemisphere can produce. The danger of navigating
                  unknown parts of this ocean was now greatly increased by our having a crazy ship,
                  and being short of provisions and every other necessary; yet the distinction of a
                  first discoverer made us chearfully encounter every danger, and submit to every
                  inconvenience; and we chose rather to incur the censure of imprudence and
                  temerity, which the idle and voluptuous so liberally bestow upon unsuccessful
                  fortitude and perseverance, than leave a country which we had discovered
                  unexplored, and give colour to a charge of timidity and irresolution. </p><p n="1022">Having now congratulated ourselves upon getting within the reef,
                  notwithstanding we had so lately congratulated ourselves upon getting without it,
                  I resolved to keep the main land on board in my future route to the northward,
                  whatever the consequence might be; for if we had now gone without the reef again,
                  it might have carried us so far from the coast, as to prevent my being able to
                  determine, whether this country did, or did not, join to New Guinea; a question
                  which I was determined to resolve from my first coming within sight of land.
                  However, as I had experienced the disadvantage of having a boat under repair, at a
                  time when it was possible I might want to use her, I determined to remain fast at
                  anchor, till the pinnace was perfectly refitted. As I had no employment for the
                  other boats, I sent them out in the morning to the reef,* to see what refreshments
                     <pb n="608"/> could be procured,* and Mr. Banks, in his little boat,
                  accompanied by Dr. Solander, went with them. In this situation I found the
                  variation by amplitude and azimuth to be <geo select="lon">4° 9′ E</geo>.; and at noon, our
                  latitude by observation was <geo select="lat" n="133">12° 38′ S</geo>. and our longitude <geo select="lon" n="133">216° 45′
                     W</geo>. The main land extended from N. 66 W. to S. W. by S. and the nearest
                  part of it was distant about nine leagues. The opening through which we had
                  passed, I called PROVIDENTIAL CHANNEL; and this bore E. N. E. distant ten or
                  twelve miles: on the main land within us was a lofty promontory which I called
                  CAPE WEYMOUTH; on the north side of which is a bay, which I called WEYMOOTH BAY:
                  they lie in latitude <geo select="lat" n="134">12° 42′ S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="134">127° 15′ W</geo>. At
                  four o'clock in the afternoon the boats returned with two hundred and forty pound
                  of the meat of shell-fish, chiefly of cockles, some of which were as much as two
                  men could move, and contained twenty pounds of good meat. Mr. Banks also brought
                  back many curious shells, and Mollusca; besides many species of coral, among which
                  was that called the Tubipora musica. </p><p n="1023">*At six o'clock in the morning, we got under sail and stood away to the
                  N.W. having two boats ahead to direct us; our soundings were very irregular,
                  varying five or six fathom every cast, between ten and twenty-seven. A little
                  before noon, we passed a low sandy island, which we left on our starboard side, at
                  the distance of two miles. At noon, our latitude was <geo select="lat">12° 28′</geo>, and our
                  distance from the main about four leagues: it extended from S. by W. to N. 71 W.
                  and some small islands from N. 40 W. to 54 W. Between us and the main were several
                  shoals, and some without us, besides the main or outermost reef, which we could
                  see from the mast-head, stretching away to the N. E. At two in the afternoon, as
                  we were steering N. W. by N. we saw a large shoal right ahead, extending three or
                  four points upon each <pb n="609"/> bow;* upon this we hauled up N. N. E. and N.
                  E. by N. to get round the north point of it, which we reached by four, and then
                  edged away to the westward, and ran between the north end of this shoal and
                  another, which lies two miles to the northward of it, having a boat all the way
                  ahead sounding; our depth of water was still very irregular, from twenty-two to
                  eight fathom. At half an hour after six, we anchored in thirteen fathom: the
                  northermost of the small islands seen at noon bore W. ½ S. distant three miles:
                  these islands are distinguished in the chart by the name of FORBES's ISLANDS, and
                  lie about five leagues from the main, which here forms a high point that we called
                  BOLT HEAD, from which the land trends more westerly, and is in that direction all
                  low and sandy; to the southward it is high and hilly even near the sea. </p><p n="1024">At six in the morning we got again under sail,* and steered for an island
                  which lay at a small distance from the main, and at this time bore from us N. 40
                  W. distant about five leagues: our course was soon interrupted by shoals; however,
                  by the help of the boats, and a good look-out from the top of the mast, we got
                  into a fair channel that led us down to the island, between a very large shoal on
                  our starboard side and several small ones towards the main: in this channel we had
                  from twenty to thirty fathom water. Between eleven and twelve o'clock we hauled
                  round the north east side of the island, leaving it between us and the main, from
                  which it is distant about seven or eight miles. This island is about a league in
                  circuit, and we saw upon it five of the natives, two of whom had lances in their
                  hands; they came down upon a point, and having looked a little while at the ship,
                  retired. To the N. W. of it are several low islands and quays, which lie not far
                  from the main; and to the northward <pb n="610"/> and eastward are several other
                  islands and shoals;* so that we were now encompassed on every side: but having
                  lately been exposed to much greater danger, and rocks and shoals being grown
                  familiar, we looked at them comparatively with little concern. The main land
                  appeared to be low and barren, interspersed with large patches of the very fine
                  white sand, which we had found upon Lizard Island and different parts of the main.
                  The boats had seen many turtle upon the shoals which they passed, but it blew too
                  hard for them to take any. At noon, our latitude by observation was
                  <geo select="lat" n="135">12°</geo>, and our longitude <geo select="lon" n="135">217° 25′</geo>: our depth of water was
                  fourteen fathom; and our course and distance, reduced to a strait line, was,
                  between this time and the preceding noon N. 29 W. thirty two miles. </p><p n="1025">The main land within the islands that have been just mentioned forms a
                  point, which I called CAPE GRENVILLE: it lies in latitude <geo select="lat" n="136">11° 58′</geo>,
                  longitude <geo select="lon" n="136">217° 38′</geo>; and between it and Bolt Head is a bay, which I
                  called TEMPLE BAY. At the distance of nine leagues from Cape Grenville, in the
                  direction of E. ½ N. lie some high islands, which I called SIR CHARLES HARDY's
                  ISLES; and those which lie off the Cape I called COCKBURN's ISLES. Having lain by
                  for the boats, which had got out of their station, till about one o'clock, we then
                  took the yawl in tow; and the pinnace having got ahead, we filled, and stood N. by
                  W. for some small islands which lay in that direction; such at least they were in
                  appearance, but upon approaching them we perceived that they were joined together
                  by a large reef: upon this we edged away N. W. and left them on our starboard
                  hand; we steered between them and the islands that lay off the main, having a
                  clear passage, and from fifteen to twenty-three fathom water. At four o'clock, we
                  discovered some low islands and <pb n="611"/> rocks, bearing W. N. W. and stood
                  directly for them:* at half an hour after six, we anchored on the north east side
                  of the northermost of them, at one mile distance, and in sixteen fathom. These
                  islands lie N. W. four leagues from Cape Grenville, and from the number of birds
                  that I saw upon them, I called them BIRD ISLES. A little before sun-set, we were
                  in sight of the main land, which appeared all very low and sandy, extending as far
                  to the northward as N. W. by N. some shoals, quays, and low sandy isles stretching
                  away to the N. E. </p><p n="1026">At six o'clock in the morning, we got again under sail,* with a fresh
                  breeze at E. and stood away N. N. W. for some low islands in that direction, but
                  were soon obliged to haul close upon a wind to weather a shoal which we discovered
                  upon our larboard bow, having at the same time others to the eastward: by the time
                  we had weathered this shoal to leeward, we had brought the islands well upon our
                  lee bow, but seeing some shoals run off from them, and some rocks on our starboard
                  bow, which we did not discover till we were very near them, I was afraid to go to
                  windward of the islands, and therefore brought to, and having made the signal for
                  the pinnace, which was ahead, to come on board, I sent her to leeward of the
                  islands, with orders to keep along the edge of the shoal, which ran off from the
                  south side of the southermost island, sending the yawl at the same time, to run
                  over the shoal in search of turtle. As soon as the pinnace had got to a proper
                  distance, we wore, and stood after her: as we ran to leeward of this island, we
                  took the yawl in tow, she having seen only one small turtle, and therefore made
                  but little stay upon the shoal. The island we found to be a small spot of sand,
                  with some trees upon it, and we could discern many huts, or habitations of the
                  natives, whom we supposed occasionally to visit these islands from <pb n="612"/>
                  the main,* they being only five leagues distant, to catch turtle, when they come
                  ashore to lay their eggs. We continued to stand after the pinnace N. N. E. and N.
                  by E. for two other low islands, having two shoals without us, and one between us
                  and the main. At noon, we were about four leagues from the main, which we saw
                  extending to the northward, as far as N. W. by N. all flat and sandy. Our
                  latitude, by observation, was <geo select="lat" n="137">11° 23′ S</geo>. and our longitude <geo select="lon" n="137">217°
                     46′ W</geo>. our soundings were from fourteen to twenty-three fathom; but
                  these, as well as the shoals and islands, which are too numerous to be
                  particularly mentioned, will be best seen upon the chart. By one o'clock, we had
                  run nearly the length of the southermost of the two islands in sight, and finding
                  that the going to windward of them would carry us too far from the main, we bore
                  up and ran to leeward, where finding a fair open passage, we steered N. by W. in a
                  direction parallel to the main, leaving a small island which lay between it and
                  the ship, and some low sandy isles and shoals without us, of all which we lost
                  sight by four o'clock, and saw no more before the sun went down: at this time the
                  farthest part of the land in sight bore N. N. W. ½ W. and soon after we anchored
                  in thirteen fathom, upon soft ground, at the distance of about five leagues from
                  the land, where we lay till day-light. </p><p n="1027">*Early in the morning, we made sail again, and steered N. N. W. by
                  compass, for the northermost land in sight; and at this time, we observed the
                  variation of the needle to be <geo select="lon">3° 6′ E</geo>. At eight o'clock, we discovered
                  shoals ahead, and on our larboard bow, and saw that the northermost land, which we
                  had taken for the main, was detached from it, and that we might pass between them,
                  by running to leeward of the shoals on our larboard bow, which were now near us:
                  we therefore wore and brought to, sending away <pb n="613"/> the pinnace and yawl
                  to direct us,* and then steered N. W. along the S. W. or inside of the shoals,
                  keeping a good look-out from the mast-head, and having another shoal on our
                  larboard side: we found however a good channel of a mile broad between them, in
                  which we had from ten to fourteen fathom. At eleven o'clock, we were nearly the
                  length of the land detached from the main, and there appeared to be no obstruction
                  in the passage between them, yet having the long-boat astern, and rigged, we sent
                  her away to keep in shore upon our larboard bow, and at the same time dispatched
                  the pinnace a-starboard; precautions which I thought necessary, as we had a strong
                  flood that carried us an end very fast, and it was near high water: as soon as the
                  boats were ahead, we stood after them, and by noon, got through the passage. Our
                  latitude, by observation, was then <geo select="lat">10° 36′</geo>, and the nearest part of the
                  main, which we soon after found to be the northermost, bore W. 2 S. distant
                  between three or four miles: we found the land which was detached from the main,
                  to be a single island, extending from N. to N. 75 E. distant between two and three
                  miles; at the same time we saw other islands at a considerable distance, extending
                  from N. by W. to W. N. W. and behind them another chain of high land, which we
                  judged also to be islands: there were still other islands, extending as far as N.
                  71 W. which at this time we took for the main. </p><p n="1028">The point of the main which forms the side of the channel through which
                  we had passed, opposite to the island, is the northern promontory of the country,
                  and I called it YORK CAPE. Its longitude is <geo select="lon">218° 24′ W</geo>. the latitude of
                  the north point is <geo select="lat">10° 37′</geo>, and of the east point <geo select="lat">10° 42′ S</geo>.
                  The land over the east point, and to the southward of it, is rather low, and as
                  far as the eye can reach, very flat, and of a barren appearance. <pb n="614"/> To
                  the southward of the Cape the shore forms a large open bay,* which I called
                  NEWCASTLE BAY, and in which are some small low islands and shoals; the land
                  adjacent is also very low, flat, and sandy. The land of the northern part of the
                  Cape is more hilly, the vallies seem to be well clothed with wood, and the shore
                  forms some small bays, in which there appeared to be good anchorage. Close to the
                  eastern point of the Cape are three small islands, from one of which a small ledge
                  of rocks runs out into the sea: there is also an island close to the northern
                  point. The island that forms the streight or channel through which we had passed,
                  lies about four miles without these, which, except two, are very small: the
                  southermost is the largest, and much higher than any part of the main land. On the
                  north west side of this island there appeared to be good anchorage, and on shore,
                  vallies that promised both wood and water. These islands are distinguished in the
                  chart by the name of YORK ISLES. To the southward, and south east, and even to the
                  eastward and northward of them, there are several other low islands, rocks, and
                  shoals: our depth of water in sailing between them and the main, was twelve,
                  thirteen, and fourteen fathom. </p><p n="1029">We stood along the shore to the westward, with a gentle breeze at S. E.
                  by S. and when we had advanced between three and four miles, we discovered the
                  land ahead, which, when we first saw it, we took for the main, to be islands
                  detached from it by several channels: upon this we sent away the boats, with
                  proper instructions, to lead us through that channel which was next the main; but
                  soon after discovering rocks and shoals in this channel, I made a signal for the
                  boats to go through the next channel to the northward, which lay between these
                  islands, leaving some of them between us and <pb n="615"/> the main: the ship
                  followed,* and had never less than five fathom water in the narrowest part of the
                  channel, where the distance from island to island was about one mile and an half. </p><p n="1030">At four o'clock in the afternoon, we anchored, being about a mile and a
                  half, or two miles, within the entrance, in six fathom and a half, with clear
                  ground: the channel here had begun to widen, and the islands on each side of us
                  were distant about a mile: the main land stretched away to the S. W. the farthest
                  point in view bore S. 48 W. and the southermost point of the islands, on the north
                  west side of the passage, bore S. 76 W. Between these two points we could see no
                  land, so that we conceived hopes of having, at last, found a passage into the
                  Indian sea; however, that I might be able to determine with more certainty, I
                  resolved to land upon the island which lies at the south east point of the
                  passage. Upon this island we had seen many of the inhabitants when we first came
                  to an anchor, and when I went into the boat, with a party of men, accompanied by
                  Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, in order to go ashore, we saw ten of them upon a hill:
                  nine of them were armed with such lances as we had been used to see, and the tenth
                  had a bow, and a bundle of arrows, which we had never seen in the possession of
                  the natives of this country before: we also observed, that two of them had large
                  ornaments of mother of pearl hanging round their necks. Three of these, one of
                  whom was the bowman, placed themselves upon the beach abreast of us, and we
                  expected that they would have opposed our landing, but when we came within about a
                  musket's shot of the beach, they walked leisurely away. We immediately climbed the
                  highest hill, which was not more than three times as high as the mast-head, and
                  the most barren of <pb n="616"/> any we had seen.* From this hill, no land could
                  be seen between the S. W. and W. S. W. so that I had no doubt of finding a channel
                  through. The land to the north west of it consisted of a great number of islands
                  of various extent, and different heights, ranged one behind another, as far to the
                  northward and westward as I could see, which could not be less than thirteen
                  leagues. As I was now about to quit the eastern coast of New Holland, which I had
                  coasted from latitude 38 to this place, and which I am confident no European had
                  ever seen before, I once more hoisted English colours, and though I had already
                  taken possession of several particular parts, I now took possession of the whole
                  eastern coast, from latitude <geo select="lat">38°</geo> to this place, latitude <geo select="lat">10½
                     S</geo>. in right of his Majesty King George the Third, by the name of NEW
                  SOUTH WALES, with all the bays, harbours, rivers, and islands situated upon it: we
                  then fired three vollies of small arms, which were answered by the same number
                  from the ship. Having performed this ceremony upon the island, which we called
                  POSSESSION ISLAND, we reimbarked in our boat, but a rapid ebb tide setting N. E.
                  made our return to the vessel very difficult and tedious. From the time of our
                  last coming among the shoals, we constantly found a moderate tide, the flood
                  setting to the N. W. and the ebb to the S. E. At this place, it is high water at
                  the full and change of the moon, about one or two o'clock, and the water rises and
                  falls perpendicularly about twelve feet. We saw smoke rising in many places from
                  the adjacent lands and islands, as we had done upon every part of the coast, after
                  our last return to it through the reef. </p><p n="1031">We continued at anchor all night, and between seven and eight o'clock in
                  the morning,* we saw three or four of the natives upon the beach gathering
                  shell-fish; we discovered, <pb n="617"/> by the help of our glasses, that they
                  were women, and,* like all the other inhabitants of this country, stark naked. At
                  low water, which happened about ten o'clock, we got under sail, and stood to the
                  S. W. with a light breeze at E. which afterwards veered to N. by E.: our depth of
                  water was from six to ten fathom, except in one place, where we had but five. At
                  noon, Possession Island bore N. 53 E. distant four leagues, the western extremity
                  of the main land in sight bore S. 43 W. distant between four and five leagues, and
                  appeared to be extremely low, the south west point of the largest island on the
                  north west side of the passage bore N. 71 W. distant eight miles, and this point I
                  called CAPE CORNWALL. It lies in latitude <geo select="lat" n="138">10° 43′ S</geo>., longitude
                  <geo select="lon" n="138">219° W</geo>.; and some low lands that lie about the middle of the
                  passage, which I called WALLIS's ISLES, bore W. by S. ½ S. distant about two
                  leagues: our latitude, by observation, was <geo select="lat">10° 46′ S</geo>. We continued to
                  advance with the tide of flood W. N. W. having little wind, and from eight to five
                  fathom water. At half an hour after one, the pinnace, which was ahead, made the
                  signal for shoal water, upon which we tacked, and sent away the yawl to sound
                  also: we then tacked again, and stood after them: in about two hours, they both
                  made the signal for shoal water, and the tide being nearly at its greatest height,
                  I was afraid to stand on, as running aground at that time might be fatal; I
                  therefore came to an anchor in somewhat less than seven fathom, sandy ground.
                  Wallis's islands bore S. by W. ½ W. distant five or six miles, the islands to the
                  northward extended from S. 73 E. to N. 10 E. and a small island, which was just in
                  sight, bore N. W. ½ W. Here we found the flood tide set to the westward, and the
                  ebb to the eastward. </p><p n="1032">After we had come to an anchor, I sent away the Master in the long-boat
                  to sound, who, upon his return in the <pb n="618"/> evening,* reported, that there
                  was a bank stretching north and south, upon which there were but three fathom, and
                  that beyond it there were seven. About this time it fell calm, and continued so
                  till nine the next morning, when we weighed, with a light breeze at S. S. E. and
                  steered N. W. by W. for the small island which was just in sight, having first
                  sent the boats ahead to sound: the depth of water was eight, seven, six, five, and
                  four fathom, and three fathom upon the bank, it being now the last quarter ebb. At
                  this time, the northermost island in sight bore N. 9 E. Cape Cornwall E. distant
                  three leagues, and Wallis's Isles S. 3 E. distant three leagues. This bank, at
                  least so much as we have sounded, extends nearly N. and S. but to what distance I
                  do not know: its breadth is not more than half a mile at the utmost. When we had
                  got over the bank, we deepened our water to six fathom three quarters, and had the
                  same depth all the way to the small island ahead, which we reached by noon, when
                  it bore S. distant about half a mile. Our depth of water was now five fathom, and
                  the northermost land in sight, which is part of the same chain of islands that we
                  had seen to the northward from the time of our first entering the streight, bore
                  N. 71 E. Our latitude, by observation, was <geo select="lat" n="139">10° 33′ S</geo>. and our longitude
                  <geo select="lon" n="139">219° 22′ W</geo>.: in this situation, no part of the main was in sight. As
                  we were now near the island, and had but little wind, Mr. Banks and I landed upon
                  it, and found it, except a few patches of wood, to be a barren rock, the haunt of
                  birds, which had frequented it in such numbers, as to make the surface almost
                  uniformly white with their dung: of these birds, the greater part seemed to be
                  boobies, and I therefore called the place BOOBY ISLAND. After a short stay, we
                  returned to the ship, and in the mean time the wind had got to the S. W.; it was
                  but a gentle breeze, yet it was accompanied by a swell from the same <pb n="619"/>
                  quarter, which, with other circumstances,* confirmed my opinion that we were got
                  to the westward of Carpentaria, or the northern extremity of New Holland, and had
                  now an open sea to the westward, which gave me great satisfaction, not only
                  because the dangers and fatigues of the voyage were drawing to an end, but because
                  it would no longer be a doubt whether New Holland and New Guinea were two separate
                  islands, or different parts of the same. </p><p n="1033">The north east entrance of this passage, or streight, lies in the
                  latitude of <geo select="lat" n="140">10° 39′ S</geo>, and in the longitude of <geo select="lon" n="140">218° 36′ W</geo>.
                  It is formed by the main, or the northern extremity of New Holland, on the S. E.
                  and by a congeries of islands, which I called the PRINCE OF WALES's ISLANDS, to
                  the N. W. and it is probable that these islands extend quite to New Guinea. They
                  differ very much both in height and circuit, and many of them seemed to be well
                  clothed with herbage and wood: upon most, if not all of them, we saw smoke, and
                  therefore there can be no doubt of their being inhabited; it is also probable,
                  that among them there are at least as good passages as that we came through,
                  perhaps better, though better would not need to be desired, if the access to it,
                  from the eastward, were less dangerous: that a less dangerous access may be
                  discovered, I think there is little reason to doubt, and to find it little more
                  seems to be necessary, than to determine how far the principal, or outer reef,
                  which bounds the shoals to the eastward, extends towards the north, which I would
                  not have left to future navigators if I had been less harassed by danger and
                  fatigue, and had had a ship in better condition for the purpose. </p><p n="1034">To this channel, or passage, I have given the name of the ship, and
                  called it ENDEAVOUR STREIGHTS. Its length from N. E. to S. W. is ten leagues, and
                  it is about five leagues <pb n="620"/> broad,* except at the north east entrance,
                  where it is somewhat less than two miles, being contracted by the islands which
                  lie there. That which I called Possession Island is of a moderate height and
                  circuit, and this we left between us and the main, passing between it and two
                  small round islands, which lie about two miles to the N. W. of it. The two small
                  islands, which I called Wallis's Islands, lie in the middle of the south west
                  entrance, and these we left to the southward. Our depth of water in the streight,
                  was from four to nine fathom, with every where good anchorage, except upon the
                  bank, which lies two leagues to the northward of Wallis's Islands, where, at low
                  water, there are but three fathom: for a more particular knowlege of this
                  streight, and of the situations of the several islands and shoals on the eastern
                  coast of New Wales, I refer to the chart, where they are delineated with all the
                  accuracy that circumstances would admit; yet, with respect to the shoals, I cannot
                  pretend that one half of them are laid down, nor can it be supposed possible that
                  one half of them should be discovered in the course of a single navigation: many
                  islands also must have escaped my pencil, especially between latitude
                  <geo select="lat">20°</geo> and <geo select="lat">22°</geo>, where we saw islands out at sea as far as an
                  island could be distinguished; it must not therefore be supposed, by future
                  navigators, that where no shoal or island is laid down in my chart, no shoal or
                  island will be found in these seas: it is enough that the situation of those that
                  appear in the chart is faithfully ascertained, and, in general, I have the
                  greatest reason to hope that it will be found as free from error as any that has
                  not been corrected by subsequent and successive observations. The latitudes and
                  longitudes of all, or most of the principal head lands and bays, may be confided
                  in, for we seldom failed of getting an observation once at least every day, by
                  which to correct the latitude of our <pb n="621"/> reckoning,* and observations
                  for settling the longitude were equally numerous, no opportunity that was offered
                  by the sun and moon being suffered to escape. It would be injurious to the memory
                  of Mr. Green; not to take this opportunity of attesting that he was indefatigable
                  both in making observations and calculating upon them; and that, by his
                  instructions and assistance, many of the petty officers were enabled both to
                  observe and calculate with great exactness. This method of finding the longitude
                  at sea, may be put into universal practice, and may always be depended upon within
                  half a degree, which is sufficient for all nautical purposes. If, therefore,
                  observing and calculating were considered as necessary qualifications for every
                  sea officer, the labours of the speculative theorist to solve this problem might
                  be remitted, without much injury to mankind: neither will it be so difficult to
                  acquire this qualification, or put it in practice, as may at first appear; for,
                  with the assistance of the nautical almanack, and astronomical ephemeris, the
                  calculations for finding the longitude will take up little more time than the
                  calculation of an azimuth for finding the variation of the compass. </p></div><pb n="622"/><div type="chapter" n="36"><head><l>CHAP.VIII.</l><l><emph rend="italic"> Departure from New South Wales; a particular Description

                        some Observations upon the Currents and Tides.</emph></l></head><p n="1035">*OF this country, its products, and its people, many particulars have
                  already been related in the course of the narrative, being so interwoven with the
                  events, as not to admit of a separation. I shall now give a more full and
                  circumstantial description of each, in which, if some things should happen to be
                  repeated, the greater part will be found new. </p><p n="1036">New Holland, or, as I have now called the eastern coast, New South Wales,
                  is of a larger extent than any other country in the known world that does not bear
                  the name of a continent: the length of coast along which we sailed, reduced to a
                  strait line, is no less than twenty-seven degrees of latitude, amounting to near
                  2000 miles, so that its square surface must be much more than equal to all Europe.
                  To the southward of 33 or 34, the land in general is low and level; farther
                  northward it is hilly, but in no part can be called mountainous, and the hills and
                  mountains, taken together, make but a small part of the surface, in comparison
                  with the vallies and plains. It is upon the whole rather barren than fertile, yet
                  the rising ground is chequered by woods and lawns, and the plains and vallies are
                  in many places covered with herbage: the soil however is frequently sandy, <pb n="623"/> and many of the lawns, or savannahs, are rocky and barren,*
                  especially to the northward, where, in the best spots, vegetation was less
                  vigorous than in the southern part of the country; the trees were not so tall, nor
                  was the herbage so rich. The grass in general is high, but thin, and the trees,
                  where they are largest, are seldom less than forty feet asunder; nor is the
                  country inland, as far as we could examine it, better clothed than the sea coast.
                  The banks of the bays are covered with mangroves, to the distance of a mile within
                  the beach, under which the soil is a rank mud, that is always overflowed by a
                  spring tide; farther in the country we sometimes met with a bog, upon which the
                  grass was very thick and luxuriant, and sometimes with a valley, that was clothed
                  with underwood: the soil in some parts seemed to be capable of improvement, but
                  the far greater part is such as can admit of no cultivation. The coast, at least
                  that part of it which lies to the northward of <geo select="lat">25° S</geo>. abounds with fine
                  bays and harbours, where vessels may lie in perfect security from all winds. </p><p n="1037">If we may judge by the appearance of the country while we were there,
                  which was in the very height of the dry season, it is well watered: we sound
                  innumerable small brooks and springs, but no great rivers; these brooks, however,
                  probably become large in the rainy season. Thirsty Sound was the only place where
                  fresh water was not to be procured for the ship, and even there one or two small
                  pools were found in the woods, though the face of the country was every where
                  intersected by salt-creeks, and mangrove land. </p><p n="1038">Of trees there is no great variety. Of those that could be called timber,
                  there are but two sorts; the largest is the gum tree, which grows all over the
                  country, and has been mentioned <pb n="624"/> already:* it has narrow leaves, not
                  much unlike a willow; and the gum, or rather resin, which it yields, is of a deep
                  red, and resembles the sanguis draconis; possibly it may be the same, for this
                  substance is known to be the produce of more than one plant. It is mentioned by
                  Dampier, and is perhaps the same that Tasman found upon Diemen's Land, where he
                  says he saw </p><p n="1039">Gum of the trees, and gum lac of the ground. The other timber tree is
                  that which grows somewhat like our pines, and has been particularly mentioned in
                  the account of Botany Bay. The wood of both these trees, as I have before
                  remarked, is extremely hard and heavy. Besides these, here are trees covered with
                  a soft bark that is easily peeled off, and is the same that in the East Indies is
                  used for the caulking of ships. We found here the palm of three different sorts.
                  The first, which grows in great plenty to the southward, has leaves that are
                  plaited like a fan: the cabbage of these is small, but exquisitely sweet; and the
                  nuts, which it bears in great abundance, are very good food for hogs. The second
                  sort bore a much greater resemblance to the true cabbage tree of the West Indies;
                  its leaves were large and pinnated, like those of the cocoa-nut; and these also
                  produced a cabbage, which though not so sweet as the other, was much larger. The
                  third sort, which, like the second, was found only in the northern parts, was
                  seldom more than ten feet high, with small pinnated leaves, resembling those of
                  some kind of fern: it bore no cabbage, but a plentiful crop of nuts, about the
                  size of a large chesnut, but rounder: as we found the hulls of these scattered
                  round the places where the Indians had made their •ires, we took for granted that
                  they were fit to eat; those however who made the experiment paid dear for their
                  knowlege of the contrary, for <pb n="625"/> they operated both as an emetic and
                  cathartic with great violence. Still, however,* we made no doubt but that they
                  were eaten by the Indians; and judging that the constitution of the hogs might be
                  as strong as theirs, though our own had proved to be so much inferior, we carried
                  them to the stye; the hogs eat them, indeed, and for some time we thought without
                  suffering any inconvenience; but in about a week they were so much disordered that
                  two of them died, and the rest were recovered with great difficulty. It is
                  probable, however, that the poisonous quality of these nuts may lie in the juice,
                  like that of the cassada of the West Indies; and that the pulp, when dried, may be
                  not only wholesome, but nutricious. Besides these species of the palm, and
                  mangroves, there were several small trees and shrubs altogether unknown in Europe;
                  particularly one which produced a very poor kind of fig; another that bore what we
                  called a plum, which it resembled in colour, but not in shape, being flat on the
                  sides like a little cheese; and a third that bore a kind of purple apple; which,
                  after it had been kept a few days, became eatable, and tasted somewhat like a
                  damascene. </p><p n="1040">Here is a great variety of plants to enrich the collection of a botanist,
                  but very few of them are of the aesculent kind. A small plant, with long, narrow,
                  grassy leaves, resembling that kind of bulrush which in England is called the
                  Cat's-tail, yields a resin of a bright yellow colour, exactly resembling gambouge,
                  except that it does not stain; it has a sweet smell, but its properties we had no
                  opportunity to discover, any more than those of many others with which the natives
                  appear to be acquainted, as they have distinguished them by names. </p><p n="1041">I have already mentioned the root and leaves of a plant resembling the
                  coccos of the West Indies, and a kind of <pb n="626"/> bean;* to which may be
                  added, a sort of parsley and purselain, and two kinds of yams; one shaped like a
                  rhadish, and the other round, and covered with stringy fibres: both sorts are very
                  small, but sweet; and we never could find the plants that produced them, though we
                  often saw the places where they had been newly dug up; it is probable that the
                  drought had destroyed the leaves, and we could not, like the Indians, discover
                  them by the stalks. </p><p n="1042">Most of the fruits of this country, such as they are, have been mentioned
                  already. We found one in the southern part of the country resembling a cherry,
                  except that the stone was soft; and another not unlike a pine-apple in appearance,
                  but of a very disagreeable taste, which is well known in the East Indies, and is
                  called by the Dutch Pyn Appel Boomen. </p><p n="1043">Of the quadrupeds, I have already mentioned the dog, and particularly
                  described the kanguroo, and the animal of the opossum kind, resembling the
                  phalanger of Buffon; to which I can add only one more, resembling a polecat, which
                  the natives call Quoll; the back is brown, spotted with white, and the belly white
                  unmixed. Several of our people said they had seen wolves; but perhaps, if we had
                  not seen tracts that favoured the account, we might have thought them little more
                  worthy of credit than he who reported that he had seen the devil. </p><p n="1044">Of batts, which hold a middle place between the beasts and the birds, we
                  saw many kinds, particularly one which, as I have observed already, was larger
                  than a partridge; we were not fortunate enough to take one either alive or dead,
                  but it was supposed to be the same as Buffon has described by the name of Rouset
                  or Rouget. </p><p n="1045"><pb n="627"/>The sea and other water-fowl of this country, are gulls,* shaggs,
                  soland geese, or gannets, of two sorts; boobies, noddies, curlieus, ducks,
                  pelicans of an enormous size, and many others. The land-birds, are crows, parrots,
                  paroquets, cockatoos, and other birds of the same kind, of exquisite beauty;
                  pigeons, doves, quails, bustards, herons, cranes, hawks, and eagles. The pigeons
                  flew in numerous flocks, so that, notwithstanding their extreme shyness, our
                  people frequently killed ten or twelve of them in a day: these birds are very
                  beautiful, and crested very differently from any we had seen before. </p><p n="1046">Among other reptiles, here are serpents of various kinds, some noxious,
                  and some harmless; scorpions, centipieds, and lizards. The insects are but few.
                  The principal are the musquito, and the ant. Of the ant there are several sorts;
                  some are as green as a leaf, and live upon trees, where they build their nests of
                  various sizes, between that of a man's head and his fist. These nests are of a
                  very curious structure: they are formed by bending down several of the leaves,
                  each of which is as broad as a man's hand, and gluing the points of them together,
                  so as to form a purse; the viscus used for this purpose, is an animal juice, which
                  Nature has enabled them to elaborate. Their method of first bending down the
                  leaves, we had not an opportunity to observe; but we saw thousands uniting all
                  their strength to hold them in this position, while other busy multitudes were
                  employed within, in applying the gluten that was to prevent their returning back.
                  To satisfy ourselves that the leaves were bent, and held down by the effort of
                  these diminutive artificers, we disturbed them in their work, and as soon as they
                  were driven from their station, the leaves on which they were employed sprung up
                  with a force much greater than we <pb n="628"/> could have thought them able to
                  conquer by any combination of their strength.* But though we gratified our
                  curiosity at their expence, the injury did not go unrevenged; for thousands
                  immediately threw themselves upon us, and gave us intolerable pain with their
                  stings, especially those which took possession of our necks and our hair, from
                  whence they were not easily driven: the sting was scarcely less painful than that
                  of a bee; but, except it was repeated, the pain did not last more than a minute. </p><p n="1047">Another sort are quite black, and their operations and manner of life are
                  not less extraordinary. Their habitations are the inside of the branches of a
                  tree, which they contrive to excavate by working out the pith almost to the
                  extremity of the slenderest twig; the tree at the same time flourishing, as if it
                  had no such inmate. When we first found the tree, we gathered some of the
                  branches, and were scarcely less astonished than we should have been to find that
                  we had prophaned a consecrated grove, where every tree, upon being wounded, gave
                  signs of life; for we were instantly covered with legions of these animals,
                  swarming from every broken bough, and inflicting their stings with incessant
                  violence. They are mentioned by Rumphius in his Herbarium Amboinense, vol. ii. p.
                  257.; but the tree in which he saw their dwelling, is very different from that in
                  which we found them. </p><p n="1048">A third kind we found nested in the root of a plant, which grows on the
                  bark of trees in the manner of misletoe, and which they had perforated for that
                  use. This root is commonly as big as a large turnip, and sometimes much bigger:
                  when we cut it, we found it intersected by innumerable winding passages, all
                  filled with these animals, by which however the vegetation of the plant did not
                  appear to <pb n="629"/> have suffered any injury.* We never cut one of these roots
                  that was not inhabited, though some were not bigger than a hazle-nut. The animals
                  themselves are very small, not more than half as big as the common red ant in
                  England. They had stings, but scarcely force enough to make them felt; they had
                  however a power of tormenting us in an equal, if not a greater degree; for the
                  moment we handled the root, they swarmed from innumerable holes, and running about
                  those parts of the body that were uncovered, produced a titillation more
                  intolerable than pain, except it is increased to great violence. Rumphins has also
                  given an account of this bulb and its inhabitants, vol. vi. p. 120. where he
                  mentions another sort that are black. </p><p n="1049">We found a fourth kind, which are perfectly harmless, and almost exactly
                  resemble the white-ants of the East Indies; the architecture of these is still
                  more curious than that of the others. They have houses of two sorts, one is
                  suspended on the branches of trees, and the other erected upon the ground: those
                  upon the trees are about three or four times as big as a man's head, and are built
                  of a brittle substance, which seems to consist of small parts of vegetables
                  kneaded together with a glutinous matter, which their bodies probably supply; upon
                  breaking this crust, innumerable cells, swarming with inhabitants, appear in a
                  great variety of winding directions, all communicating with each other, and with
                  several apertures that lead to other nests upon the same tree: they have also one
                  large avenue, or covered way, leading to the ground, and carried on under it to
                  the other nest or house that is constructed there. This house is generally at the
                  root of a tree, but not of that upon which their other dwellings are constructed:
                  it is formed like an irregularly sided cone, and sometimes is more than six feet
                     <pb n="630"/> high,* and nearly as much in diameter. Some are smaller, and
                  these are generally flat sided, and very much resemble in figure the stones which
                  are seen in many parts of England, and supposed to be the remains of druidical
                  antiquity. The outside of these is of well tempered clay, about two inches thick;
                  and within are the cells, which have no opening outwards, but communicate only
                  with the subterranean way to the houses on the tree, and to the tree near which
                  they are constructed, where they ascend up the root, and so up the trunk and
                  branches, under covered ways of the same kind as those by which they descended
                  from, their other dwellings. To these structures on the ground they probably
                  retire in the winter, or rainy seasons, as they are proof against any wet that can
                  fall; which those in the tree, though generally constructed under some overhanging
                  branch, from the nature and thinness of their crust or wall, cannot be. </p><p n="1050">The sea in this country is much more liberal of food to the inhabitants
                  than the land; and though fish is not quite so plenty here as they generally are
                  in higher latitudes, yet we seldom hauled the seine without taking from fifty to
                  two hundred weight. They are of various sorts; but, except the mullet, and some of
                  the shell-fish, none of them are known in Europe: most of them are palatable, and
                  some are very delicious. Upon the shoals and reef there are incredible numbers of
                  the finest green turtle in the world, and oysters of various kinds, particularly
                  the rock-oyster and the pearl-oyster. The gigantic cockles have been mentioned
                  already; besides which there are sea-crayfish, or lobsters, and crabs; of these
                  however we saw only the shells. In the rivers and salt crecks there are aligators. </p><p n="1051"><pb n="631"/>The only person who has hitherto given any account of this country or
                  its inhabitants is Dampier, and though he is,* in general, a writer of credit, yet
                  in many particulars he is mistaken. The people whom he saw were indeed inhabitants
                  of a part of the coast very distant from that which we visited; but we also saw
                  inhabitants upon parts of the coast very distant from each other, and there being
                  a perfect uniformity in person and customs among them all, it is reasonable to
                  conclude, that distance in another direction has not considerably broken it. </p><p n="1052">The number of inhabitants in this country appears to be very small in
                  proportion to its extent. We never saw so many as thirty of them together but
                  once, and that was at Botany Bay, when men, women, and children, assembled upon a
                  rock to see the ship pass by: when they manifestly formed a resolution to engage
                  us, they never could muster above fourteen or fifteen fighting men; and we never
                  saw a number of their sheds or houses together that could accommodate a larger
                  party. It is true, indeed, that we saw only the sea-coast on the eastern side; and
                  that, between this and the western shore, there is an immense tract of country
                  wholly unexplored: but there is great reason to believe that this immense tract is
                  either wholly desolate, or at least still more thinly inhabited than the parts we
                  visited. It is impossible that the inland country should subsist inhabitants at
                  all seasons without cultivation; it is extremely improbable that the inhabitants
                  of the coast should be totally ignorant of arts of cultivation, which were
                  practised inland; and it is equally improbable that, if they knew such arts, there
                  should be no traces of them among them. It is certain that we did not see one foot
                  of ground in a state of cultivation in the whole country; and therefore it may
                  well be concluded that where <pb n="632"/> the sea does not contribute to feed the
                  inhabitants,* the country is not inhabited. </p><p n="1053">The only tribe with which we had any intercourse, we found where the ship
                  was careened; it consisted of one and twenty persons; twelve men, seven women, one
                  boy, and one girl: the women we never saw but at a distance; for when the men came
                  over the river they were always left behind. The men here, and in other places,
                  were of a middle size, and in general well made, clean limbed, and remarkably
                  vigorous, active, and nimble: their countenances were not altogether without
                  expression, and their voices were remarkably soft and effeminate. </p><p n="1054">Their skins were so uniformly covered with dirt, that it was very
                  difficult to ascertain their true colour: we made several attempts, by wetting our
                  fingers and rubbing it, to remove the incrustations, but with very little effect.
                  With the dirt they appear nearly as black as a Negroe; and according to our best
                  discoveries, the skin itself is of the colour of wood soot, or what is commonly
                  called a chocolate colour. Their features are far from being disagreeable, their
                  noses are not flat, nor are their lips thick; their teeth are white and even, and
                  their hair naturally long and black, it is however universally cropped short; in
                  general it is strait, but sometimes it has a slight curl; we saw none that was not
                  matted and filthy, though without oil or grease, and to our great astonishment
                  free from lice. Their beards were of the same colour with their hair, and bushy
                  and thick: they are not however suffered to grow long. A man whom we had seen one
                  day with his beard somewhat longer than his companions, we saw the next, with it
                  somewhat shorter, and upon examination found the ends of the hairs burnt: from
                  this incident, and our having never seen any sharp instrument <pb n="633"/> among
                  them,* we concluded that both the hair and the beard were kept short by singeing
                  them. </p><p n="1055">Both sexes, as I have already observed, go stark naked, and seem to have
                  no more sense of indecency in discovering the whole body, than we have in
                  discovering our hands and face. Their principal ornament is the bone which they
                  thrust through the cartilage that divides the nostrils from each other: what
                  perversion of taste could make them think this a decoration, or what could prompt
                  them, before they had worn it or seen it worn, to suffer the pain and
                  inconvenience that must of necessity attend it, is perhaps beyond the power of
                  human sagacity to determine: as this bone is as thick as a man's finger, and
                  between five and six inches long, it reaches quite across the face, and so
                  effectually stops up both the nostrils that they are forced to keep their mouths
                  wide open for breath, and snuffle so when they attempt to speak, that they are
                  scarcely intelligible even to each other. Our seamen, with some humour, called it
                  their spritsail-yard; and indeed it had so ludicrous an appearance, that till we
                  were used to it, we found it difficult to refrain from laughter. Beside this
                  nose-jewel, they had necklaces made of shells, very neatly cut and strung
                  together; bracelets of small cord, wound two or three times about the upper part
                  of their arm, and a string of plaited human hair about as thick as a thread of
                  yarn, tied round the waist. Besides these, some of them had gorgets of shells
                  hanging round the neck, so as to reach cross the breast. But though these people
                  wear no clothes, their bodies have a covering besides the dirt, for they paint
                  them both white and red: the red is commonly laid on in broad patches upon the
                  shoulders and breast; and the white in stripes, some narrow, and some broad: the
                  narrow were drawn over the limbs, and the broad over the body, not without some
                  degree of taste. The white <pb n="634"/> was also laid on in small patches upon
                  the face,* and drawn in a circle round each eye. The red seemed to be ochre, but
                  what the white was we could not discover; it was close grained, saponaceous to the
                  touch, and almost as heavy as white lead; possibly it might be a kind of
                  Steatites, but to our great regret we could not procure a bit of it to examine.
                  They have holes in their ears, but we never saw any thing worn in them. Upon such
                  ornaments as they had, they set so great a value, that they would never part with
                  the least article for any thing we could offer; which was the more extraordinary
                  as our beads and ribbons were ornaments of the same kind, but of a more regular
                  form and more showy materials. They had indeed no idea of traffic, nor could we
                  communicate any to them: they received the things that we gave them; but never
                  appeared to understand our signs when we required a return. The same indifference
                  which prevented them from buying what we had, prevented them also from attempting
                  to steal: if they had coveted more, they would have been less honest; for when we
                  refused to give them a turtle, they were enraged, and attempted to take it by
                  force, and we had nothing else upon which they seemed to set the least value; for,
                  as I have before observed, many of the things that we had given them, we found
                  left negligently about in the woods, like the playthings of children, which please
                  only while they are new. Upon their bodies we saw no marks of disease or sores,
                  but large scars in irregular lines, which appeared to be the remains of wounds
                  which they had inflicted upon themselves with some blunt instrument, and which we
                  understood by signs to have been memorials of grief for the dead. </p><p n="1056">They appeared to have no fixed habitations, for we saw nothing like a
                  town or village in the whole country. Their houses, if houses they may be called,
                  seem to be formed <pb n="635"/> with less art and industry than any we had seen,*
                  except the wretched hovels at Terra del Fuego, and in some respects they are
                  inferior even to them. At Botany Bay, where they were best, they were just high
                  enough for a man to sit upright in; but not large enough for him to extend himself
                  in his whole length in any direction: they are built with pliable rods about as
                  thick as a man's finger, in the form of an oven, by sticking the two ends into the
                  ground, and then covering them with palm leaves, and broad pieces of bark: the
                  door is nothing but a large hole at one end, opposite to which the fire is made,
                  as we perceived by the ashes. Under these houses, or sheds, they sleep, coiled up
                  with their heels to their head; and in this position one of them will hold three
                  or four persons. As we advanced northward, and the climate became warmer, we found
                  these sheds still more slight: they were built, like the others, of twigs, and
                  covered with bark; but none of them were more than four feet deep, and one side
                  was intirely open: the close side was always opposed to the course of the
                  prevailing wind, and opposite to the open side was the fire, probably more as a
                  defence from the musquitos than the cold. Under these hovels it is probable, that
                  they thrust only their heads and the upper part of their bodies, extending their
                  feet towards the fire. They were set up occasionally by a wandering hord, in any
                  place that would furnish them for a time with subsistence, and left behind them
                  when, after it was exhausted, they went away: but in places where they remained
                  only for a night or two, they slept without any shelter, except the bushes or
                  grass, which is here near two feet high. We observed, however, that though the
                  sleeping huts which we found upon the main, were always turned from the prevailing
                  wind, those upon the islands were turned towards it; which seems to be a proof
                  that they have a mild season here, during which <pb n="636"/> the sea is calm,*
                  and that the same weather which enables them to visit the islands, makes the air
                  welcome even while they sleep. </p><p n="1057">The only furniture belonging to these houses that fell under our
                  observation, is a kind of oblong vessel made of bark, by the simple contrivance of
                  tying up the two ends with a withy, which not being cut off serves for a handle;
                  these we imagined were used as buckets to fetch water from the spring, which may
                  be supposed sometimes to be at a considerable distance. They have however a small
                  bag, about the size of a moderate cabbage-net, which is made by laying threads
                  loop within loop, somewhat in the manner of knitting used by our ladies to make
                  purses. This bag the man carries loose upon his back by a small string which
                  passes over his head; it generally contains a lump or two of paint and resin, some
                  fish-hooks and lines, a shell or two, out of which their hooks are made, a few
                  points of darts, and their usual ornaments, which includes the whole worldly
                  treasure of the richest man among them. </p><p n="1058">Their fish-hooks are very neatly made, and some of them are exceedingly
                  small. For striking turtle they have a peg of wood which is about a foot long, and
                  very well bearded; this fits into a socket at the end of a staff of light wood,
                  about as thick as a man's wrist, and about seven or eight feet long: to the staff
                  is tied one end of a loose line about three or four fathom long, the other end of
                  which is fastened to the peg. To strike the turtle, the peg is fixed into the
                  socket, and when it has entered his body, and is retained there by the barb, the
                  staff flies off and serves for a float to trace their victim in the water; it
                  assists also to tire him, till they can overtake him with their canoes, and haul
                  him ashore. One of these pegs, as I have mentioned already, we found buried in the
                     <pb n="637"/> body of a turtle, which had healed up over it.* Their lines are
                  from the thickness of a half inch rope to the fineness of a hair, and are made of
                  some vegetable substance, but what in particular we had no opportunity to learn. </p><p n="1059">Their food is chiefly fish, though they sometimes contrive to kill the
                  kanguroo, and even birds of various kinds; notwithstanding they are so shy that we
                  found it difficult to get within reach of them with a fowling-piece. The only
                  vegetable that can be considered as an article of food is the yam; yet doubtless
                  they eat the several fruits which have been mentioned among other productions of
                  the country; and indeed we saw the shells and hulls of several of them lying about
                  the places where they had kindled their fire. </p><p n="1060">They do not appear to eat any animal food raw; but having no vessel in
                  which water can be boiled, they either broil it upon the coals, or bake it in a
                  hole by the help of hot stones, in the same manner as is practised by the
                  inhabitants of the islands in the South Seas. </p><p n="1061">Whether they are acquainted with any plant that has an intoxicating
                  quality, we do not know; but we observed that several of them held leaves of some
                  sort constantly in their mouths, as an European does tobacco, and an East Indian
                  betele: we never saw the plant, but when they took it from their mouths at our
                  request; possibly it might be a species of the betele, but whatever it was, it had
                  no effect upon the teeth or the lips. </p><p n="1062">As they have no nets, they catch fish only by striking, or with a hook
                  and line, except such as they find in the hollows of the rocks and shoals, which
                  are dry at half ebb. </p><p n="1063">Their manner of hunting we had no opportunity to see; but we conjectured
                  by the notches which they had every <pb n="638"/> where cut in large trees in
                  order to climb them,* that they took their station near the tops of them, and
                  there watched for such animals as might happen to pass near enough to be reached
                  by their lances: it is possible also, that in this situation they might take birds
                  when they came to roost. </p><p n="1064">I have observed that when they went from our tents upon the banks of
                  Endeavour river, we could trace them by the fires which they kindled in their way;
                  and we imagined that these fires were intended some way for the taking the
                  kanguroo, which we observed to be so much afraid of fire, that our dogs could
                  scarcely force it over places which had been newly burnt, though the fire was
                  extinguished. </p><p n="1065">They produce fire with great facility, and spread it in a wonderful
                  manner. To produce it they take two pieces of dry soft wood, one is a stick about
                  eight or nine inches long, the other piece is flat: the stick they shape into an
                  obtuse point at one end, and pressing it upon the other, turn it nimbly by holding
                  it between both their hands as we do a chocolate mill, often shifting their hands
                  up, and then moving them down upon it, to increase the pressure as much as
                  possible. By this method they get fire in less than two minutes, and from the
                  smallest spark they increase it with great speed and dexterity. We have often seen
                  one of them run along the shore, to all appearance with nothing in his hand, who
                  stooping down for a moment, at the distance of every fifty or a hundred yards,
                  left fire behind him, as we could see first by the smoke, and then by the flame
                  among the drift wood, and other litter which was scattered along the place. We had
                  the curiosity to examine one of these planters of fire, when he set off, and we
                  saw him wrap up a small spark in dry grass, which, when he had run a little way,
                  having been fanned by the air that his motion produced, <pb n="639"/> began to
                  blaze;* he then laid it down in a place convenient for his purpose, inclosing a
                  spark of it in another quantity of grass, and so continued his course. </p><p n="1066">There are perhaps few things in the history of mankind more extraordinary
                  than the discovery and application of fire: it will scarcely be disputed that the
                  manner of producing it, whether by collision or attrition, was discovered by
                  chance: but its first effects would naturally strike those to whom it was a new
                  object, with consternation and terror: it would appear to be an enemy to life and
                  nature, and to torment and destroy whatever was capable of being destroyed or
                  tormented; and therefore it seems not easy to conceive what should incline those
                  who first saw it receive a transient existence from chance, to reproduce it by
                  design. It is by no means probable that those who first saw fire, approached it
                  with the same caution, as those who are familiar with its effects, so as to be
                  warmed only and not burnt; and it is reasonable to think that the intolerable pain
                  which, at its first appearance, it must produce upon ignorant curiosity, would sow
                  perpetual enmity between this element and mankind; and that the same principle
                  which incites them to crush a serpent, would incite them to destroy fire, and
                  avoid all means by which it would be produced, as soon as they were known. These
                  circumstances considered, how men became sufficiently familiar with it to render
                  it useful, seems to be a problem very difficult to solve: nor is it easy to
                  account for the first application of it to culinary purposes, as the eating both
                  animal and vegetable food raw, must have become a habit, before there was fire to
                  dress it, and those who have considered the force of habit will readily believe,
                  that to men who had always eaten the flesh of animals raw, it would be as
                  disagreeable dressed, as to those who have always eaten it dressed, it would be
                  raw. It is remarkable that the inhabitants <pb n="640"/> of Terra del Fuego
                  produce fire from a spark by collision,* and that the happier natives of this
                  country, New Zealand, and Otaheite, produce it by the attrition of one combustible
                  substance against another: is there not then some reason to suppose that these
                  different operations correspond with the manner in which chance produced fire in
                  the neighbourhood of the torrid and frigid zones? Among the rude inhabitants of a
                  cold country, neither any operation of art, or occurrence of accident, could be
                  supposed so easily to produce fire by attrition, as in a climate where every thing
                  is hot, dry, and adust, teeming with a latent fire which a slight degree of motion
                  was sufficient to call forth; in a cold country therefore, it is natural to
                  suppose that fire was produced by the accidental collision of two metallic
                  substances, and in a cold country, for that reason, the same expedient was used to
                  produce it by design: but in hot countries, where two combustible substances
                  easily kindle by attrition, it is probable that the attrition of such substances
                  first produced fire, and here it was therefore natural for art to adopt the same
                  operation, with a view to produce the same effect. It may indeed be true that fire
                  is now produced in many cold countries by attrition, and in many hot by a stroke;
                  but perhaps upon enquiry there may appear reason to conclude that this has arisen
                  from the communication of one country with another, and that with respect to the
                  original production of fire in hot and cold countries, the distinction is well
                  founded. </p><p n="1067">There may perhaps be some reason to suppose that men became gradually
                  acquainted with the nature and effects of fire, by its permanent existence in a
                  volcano, there being remains of volcanoes, or vestiges of their effects, in almost
                  every part of the world: by a volcano, however, no method of producing fire,
                  otherwise than by contact, could be learnt▪ <pb n="641"/> the production and
                  application of fire therefore,* still seem to afford abundant subject of
                  speculation to the curious. </p><p n="1068">The weapons of these people are spears or lances, and these are of
                  different kinds: some that we saw upon the southern part of the coast had four
                  prongs, pointed with bone, and barbed; the points were also smeared with a hard
                  resin, which gave them a polish, and made them enter deeper into what they struck.
                  To the northward, the lance has but one point: the shaft is made of cane, or the
                  stalk of a plant somewhat resembling a bulrush, very strait and light, and from
                  eight to fourteen feet long, consisting of several joints, where the pieces are
                  let into each other, and bound together; to this are fitted points of different
                  kinds; some are of hard heavy wood, and some are the bones of fish: we saw several
                  that were pointed with the stings of the sting-ray, the largest that they could
                  procure, and barbed with several that were smaller, fastened on in a contrary
                  direction; the points of wood were also sometimes armed with sharp pieces of
                  broken shells, which were stuck in, and at the junctures covered with resin: the
                  lances that are thus barbed, are indeed dreadful weapons, for when once they have
                  taken place, they can never be drawn back without tearing away the flesh, or
                  leaving the sharp ragged splinters of the bone or shell which forms the beard,
                  behind them in the wound. These weapons are thrown with great force and dexterity;
                  if intended to wound at a short distance, between ten and twenty yards, simply
                  with the hand, but if at the distance of forty or fifty, with an instrument which
                  we called a throwing stick. This is a plain smooth piece of a hard reddish wood,
                  very highly polished, about two inches broad, half an inch thick, and three feet
                  long, with a small knob, or hook at one end, and a cross piece about three or four
                  •nches long at the other: the knob at one end is received in <pb n="642"/> a small
                  dent or hollow,* which is made for that purpose in the shaft of the lance near the
                  point, but from which it easily slips, upon being impelled, forward: when the
                  lance is laid along upon this machine, and secured in a proper position by the
                  knob, the person that is to throw it holds it over his shoulder, and after shaking
                  it, delivers both the throwing stick and lance with all his force, but the stick
                  being stopped by the cross piece which comes against the shoulder, with a sudden
                  jerk, the lance flies forward with incredible swiftness, and with so good an aim,
                  that at the distance of fifty yards these Indians were more sure of their mark
                  than we could be with a single bullet. Besides these lances, we saw no offensive
                  weapon upon this coast, except when we took our last view of it with our glasses,
                  and then we thought we saw a man with a bow and arrows, in which it is possible we
                  might be mistaken. We saw, however, at Botany Bay, a shield or target, of an
                  oblong shape, about three feet long, and eighteen inches broad, which was made of
                  the bark of a tree: this was fetched out of a hut by one of the men that opposed
                  our landing, who, when he ran away, left it behind him, and upon taking it up, we
                  found that it had been pierced through with a single pointed lance near the
                  center. These shields are certainly in frequent use among the people here, for
                  though this was the only one that we saw in their possession, we frequently found
                  trees from which they appeared manifestly to have been cut, the marks being easily
                  distinguished from those that were made by cutting buckets: sometimes also we
                  found the shields cut out, but not yet taken off from the tree, the edges of the
                  bark only being a little raised by wedges, so that these people appear to have
                  discovered that the bark of a tree becomes thicker and stronger by being suffered
                  to remain upon the trunk after it has been cut round. </p><p n="1069"><pb n="643"/>The canoes of New Holland are as mean and rude as the houses.* Those
                  on the southern part of the coast are nothing more than a piece of bark, about
                  twelve feet long, tied together at the ends, and kept open in the middle by small
                  bows of wood: yet in a vessel of this construction we once saw three people. In
                  shallow water they are set forward by a pole, and in deeper by paddles, about
                  eighteen inches long, one of which the boatman holds in each hand; mean as they
                  are, they have many conveniences, they draw but little water, and they are very
                  light, so that they go upon mud banks to pick up shell fish, the most important
                  use to which they can be applied, better perhaps than vessels of any other
                  construction. We observed, that in the middle of these canoes there was a heap of
                  sea-weed, and upon that a small fire; probably that the fish may be broiled and
                  eaten the moment it is caught. </p><p n="1070">The canoes that we saw when we advanced farther to the northward, are not
                  made of bark, but of the trunk of a tree hollowed, perhaps by fire. They are about
                  fourteen feet long, and, being very narrow, are fitted with an outrigger to
                  prevent their oversetting. These are worked with paddles, that are so large as to
                  require both hands to manage one of them: the outside is wholly unmarked by any
                  tool, but at each end the wood is left longer at the top than at the bottom, so
                  that there is a projection beyond the hollow part resembling the end of a plank;
                  the sides are tolerably thin, but how the tree is felled and fashioned, we had no
                  opportunity to learn. The only tools that we saw among them are an adze,
                  wretchedly made of stone, some small pieces of the same substance in form of a
                  wedge, a wooden mallet, and some shells and fragments of coral. For polishing
                  their throwing sticks, and the points of their lances, they use the leaves of a
                  kind of wild fig-tree, which bites upon wood almost <pb n="644"/> as keenly as the
                  shave-grass of Europe,* which is used by our joiners: with such tools, the making
                  even such a canoe as I have described, must be a most difficult and tedious
                  labour: to those who have been accustomed to the use of metal, it appears
                  altogether impracticable; but there are few difficulties that will not yield to
                  patient perseverance, and he who does all he can, will certainly produce effects
                  that greatly exceed his apparent power. </p><p n="1071">The utmost freight of these canoes is four people, and if more at any
                  time wanted to come over the river, one of those who came first was obliged to go
                  back for the rest: from this circumstance, we conjectured that the boat we saw,
                  when we were lying in Endeavour River, was the only one in the neighbourhood: we
                  have however some reason to believe that the bark canoes are also used where the
                  wooden ones are constructed, for upon one of the small islands where the natives
                  had been fishing for turtle, we found one of the little paddles which had belonged
                  to such a boat, and would have been useless on board any other. </p><p n="1072">By what means the inhabitants of this country are reduced to such a
                  number as it can subsist, is not perhaps very easy to guess; whether, like the
                  inhabitants of New Zealand, they are destroyed by the hands of each other in
                  contests for food; whether they are swept off by accidental famine, or whether
                  there is any cause which prevents the increase of the species, must be left for
                  future adventurers to determine. That they have wars, appears by their weapons;
                  for supposing the lances to serve merely for the striking of fish, the shield
                  could be intended for nothing but a defence against men; the only mark of
                  hostility, however, which we saw among them, was the perforation of the shield by
                  a spear which has been just mentioned, for none of them appeared to have been
                  wounded by an enemy. Neither can we determine <pb n="645"/> whether they are
                  pusilanimous or brave;* the resolution with which two of them attempted to prevent
                  our landing, when we had two boats full of men, in Botany Bay, even after one of
                  them was wounded with small shot, gave us reason to conclude that they were not
                  only naturally courageous, but that they had acquired a familiarity with the
                  dangers of hostility, and were, by habit as well as nature, a daring and warlike
                  people; but their precipitate flight from every other place that we approached,
                  without even a menace, while they were out of our reach, was an indication of
                  uncommon tameness and timidity, such as those who had only been occasionally
                  warriors must be supposed to have shaken off, whatever might have been their
                  natural disposition. I have faithfully related facts, the reader must judge of the
                  people for himself. </p><p n="1073">From the account that has been given of our commerce with them, it cannot
                  be supposed that we should know much of their language; yet as this is an object
                  of great curiosity, especially to the learned, and of great importance in their
                  researches into the origin of the various nations that have been discovered, we
                  took some pains to bring away such a specimen of it as might, in a certain degree,
                  answer the purpose, and I shall now give an account how it was procured. If we
                  wanted to know the name of a stone, we took a stone up into our hands, and as well
                  as we could, intimated by signs that we wished they should name it: the word that
                  they pronounced upon the occasion, we immediately wrote down. This method, though
                  it was the best we could contrive, might certainly lead us into many mistakes; for
                  if an Indian was to take up a stone, and ask us the name of it, we might answer a
                  pebble or a flint; so when we took up a stone, and asked an Indian the name of it,
                  he might pronounce a word that distinguished the species and not the <pb n="646"/>
                  genus,* or that, instead of signifying stone simply, might signify a rough stone,
                  or a smooth stone; however, as much as possible to avoid mistakes of this kind,
                  several of us contrived, at different times, to get from them as many words as we
                  could, and having noted them down, compared our lists: those which were the same
                  in all, and which, according to every one's account, signified the same thing, we
                  ventured to record, with a very few others, which, from the simplicity of the
                  subject, and the ease of expressing our question with plainness and precision by a
                  sign, have acquired equal authority. </p><p n="1074">English. New Holland. The head, Wageegee. Hair, Morye. Eyes, Meul. Ears,

                  observations relative to the currents and tides upon the coast. From latitude
                  <geo select="lat">32°</geo>, and somewhat higher, down to Sandy Cape, in latitude <geo select="lat">24°
                     46′</geo>, we constantly sound a current setting to the southward, at the rate
                  of about ten or fifteen miles a day, being more or less, according to our distance
                  from the land, for it always ran with more force in shore than in the offing; but
                  I could never satisfy myself whether the flood-tide came from the southward, the
                  eastward, or the northward: I inclined to the opinion that it came from the
                  south-east, but the first time we anchored off the coast, which was in latitude
                  <geo select="lat">24° 30′</geo>, about ten leagues to the south east of Bustard Bay, I found
                  it come from the north west; on the contrary, thirty leagues farther to the north
                  west, on the south side of Keppel Bay, I found that it came from the east, and at
                  the northern part of that Bay it came from the northward, but with a much slower
                  motion than it had come from the east: on the east side of the Bay of Inlets, it
                  set strongly to the westward, as far as the opening of Broad Sound; but on the
                  north side of that Sound, it came with a very slow motion from the north west; and
                  when we lay at anchor before 〈◊〉 Bay, <pb n="648"/> it came from the northward:*
                  to account for its course in all this variety of directions, we need only admit
                  that the flood-tide comes from the east or south east. It is well known, that
                  where there are deep inlets, and large creeks into low lands, running up from the
                  sea, and not occasioned by rivers of fresh water, there will always be a great
                  indraught of the flood-tide, the direction of which will be determined by the
                  position or direction of the coast which forms the entrance of such inlet,
                  whatever be its course at sea; and where the tides are weak, which upon this coast
                  is generally the case, a large inlet will, if I may be allowed the expression,
                  attract the flood-tide for many leagues. </p><p n="1075">A view of the chart will at once illustrate this position. To the
                  northward of Whitsunday's Passage there is no large inlet, consequently the flood
                  sets to the northward, or north westward, according to the direction of the coast,
                  and the ebb to the south, or south eastward, at least such is their course at a
                  little distance from the land, for very near it they will be influenced by small
                  inlets. I also observed, that we had only one high tide in twenty-four hours,
                  which happened in the night. The difference between the perpendicular rise of the
                  water in the day and the night, when there is a spring-tide, is no less than three
                  feet, which, where the tides are so inconsiderable as they are here, is a great
                  proportion of the whole difference between high and low water. This irregularity
                  of the tides, which is worthy of notice, we did not discover till we were run
                  ashore, and perhaps farther to the northward it is still greater: after we got
                  within the reef the second time, we found the tides more considerable than we had
                  ever done before, except in the Bay of Inlets, and possibly this may be owing to
                  the water being more confined between the shoals; here also the flood sets to <pb n="649"/> the north west,* and continues in the same direction to the extremity
                  of New Wales, from whence its direction is west and south west into the Indian
                  sea. </p></div><div type="chapter" n="37"><head><l>CHAP.IX.</l><l><emph rend="italic"> The Passage from New South Wales to New Guinea, with an

                  we steered W. N. W. with light airs from the S. S. W. till five o'clock, when it
                  fell calm, and the tide of ebb soon after setting to the N. E. we came to an
                  anchor in eight fathom water, with a soft sandy bottom. Booby Island bore S. 50 E.
                  distant five miles, and the Prince of Wales's Isles extended from N. E. by N. to
                  S. 55 E.; between these there appeared to be a clear open passage, extending from
                  N. 46 E. to E. by N. </p><p n="1077">At half an hour after five, in the morning of the <date>24th</date>,* as we were
                  purchasing the anchor, the cable parted at about eight or ten fathom from the
                  ring: the ship then began to drive, but I immediately dropped another anchor,
                  which brought her up before she got more than a cable's length from the buoy; the
                  boats were then sent to sweep for the anchor, but could not succeed. At noon, our
                  latitude, by observation, was <geo select="lat">10° 30′ S</geo>. As I was resolved not to leave
                  the anchor behind, while there remained a possibility of recovering it, I sent the
                  boats again after dinner, with a small line, to discover where it lay; this being
                  happily effected, we swept for it with a hawser, and by the same hawser hove the
                  ship up to it: we proceeded to weigh it, but <pb n="650"/> just as we were about
                  to ship it,* the hawser slipped, and we had all our labour to repeat: by this time
                  it was dark, and we were obliged to suspend our operations till the morning. </p><p n="1078">*As soon as it was light, we sweeped it again, and heaved it to the bows:
                  by eight o'clock, we weighed the other anchor, got under sail, and, with a fine
                  breeze at E. N. E. stood to the north west. At noon, our latitude, by observation,
                  was <geo select="lat" n="141">10° 18′ S</geo>. longitude <geo select="lon" n="141">219° 39′ W</geo>. At this time, we had no
                  land in sight, but about two miles to the southward of us lay a large shoal, upon
                  which the sea broke with great violence, and part of which, I believe, is dry at
                  low water. It extends N. W. and S. E. and is about five leagues in circuit. Our
                  depth of water, from the time we weighed till now, was nine fathom, but it soon
                  shallowed to seven fathom; and at half an hour after one, having run eleven miles
                  between noon and that time, the boat which was a-head made the signal for shoal
                  water; we immediately let go an anchor, and brought the ship up with all the sails
                  standing, for the boat having just been relieved, was at but a little distance:
                  upon looking out from the ship, we saw shoal water almost all round us, both wind
                  and tide at the same time setting upon it. The ship was in six fathom, but upon
                  sounding round her, at the distance of half a cable's length, we found scarcely
                  two. This shoal reached from the east, round by the north and west, as far as the
                  south west, so that there was no way for us to get clear but that which we came.
                  This was another hair's-breadth escape, for it was near high water, and there run
                  a short cockling sea, which must very soon have bulged the ship if she had struck;
                  and if her direction had been half a cable's length more either to the right or
                  left, she must have struck before the signal for the shoal was made. The shoals
                  which, like these, lie a fathom or two under water, are the most dangerous of any,
                  for they do <pb n="651"/> not discover themselves till the vessel is just upon
                  them,* and then indeed the water looks brown, as if it reflected a dark cloud.
                  Between three and four o'clock the tide of ebb began to make, and I sent the
                  Master to sound to the southward and south westward, and in the mean time, as the
                  ship tended, I weighed anchor, and with a little sail stood first to the
                  southward, and afterwards edging away to the westward, got once more out of
                  danger. At sunset, we anchored in ten fathom, with a sandy bottom, having a fresh
                  gale at E. S. E. </p><p n="1079">At six in the morning, we weighed again and stood west,* having, as
                  usual, first sent a boat ahead to sound. I had intended to steer N. W. till I had
                  made the south coast of New Guinea, designing, if possible, to touch upon it; but
                  upon meeting with these shoals, I altered my course, in hopes of finding a clearer
                  channel, and deeper water. In this I succeeded, for by noon our depth of water was
                  gradually increased to seventeen fathom. Our latitude was now by observation
                  <geo select="lat" n="142">10° 10′ S</geo>.; and our longitude <geo select="lon" n="142">220° 12′ W</geo>. No land was in
                  sight. We continued to steer west till sunset, our depth of water being from
                  twenty-seven to twenty-three fathom: we then shortened sail, and kept upon a wind
                  all night; four hours on one tack, and four on another. At day-light, we made all
                  the sail we could,* and steered W. N. W. till eight o'clock, and then N. W. At
                  noon, our latitude by observation was <geo select="lat" n="143">9° 56′ S</geo>.; longitude <geo select="lon" n="143">221°
                     W</geo>.; variation <geo select="lon">2° 30′ E</geo>. We continued our N. W. course till
                  sunset, when we again shortened sail, and hauled close upon a wind to the
                  northward: our depth of water was twenty-one fathom. At eight, we tacked and stood
                  to the southward till twelve; then stood to the northward with little sail till
                  day-light:* our soundings were from twenty-five to seventeen fathom, the water
                  growing gradually shallow as we stood to the northward. <pb n="652"/> At this time
                  we made sail and stood to the north,* in order to make the land of New Guinea:
                  from the time of making sail till noon, the depth of water gradually decreased
                  from seventeen to twelve fathom, with a stoney and shelly bottom. Our latitude by
                  observation was now <geo select="lat">8° 52′ S</geo>. which is in the same parallel as that in
                  which the southern parts of New Guinea are laid down in the charts; but there are
                  only two points so far to the south, and I reckoned that we were a degree to the
                  westward of them both, and therefore did not see the land, which trends more to
                  the northward. We found the sea here to be in many parts covered with a brown
                  scum, such as sailors generally call spawn. When I first saw it, I was alarmed,
                  fearing that we were among shoals; but upon sounding, we found the same depth of
                  water as in other places. This scum was examined both by Mr. Banks and Dr.
                  Solander, but they could not determine what it was: it was formed of innumerable
                  small particles, not more than half a line in length, each of which in the
                  microscope appeared to consist of thirty or forty tubes; and each tube was divided
                  through its whole length by small partitions into many cells, like the tubes of
                  the conferva: they were supposed to belong to the vegetable kingdom, because upon
                  burning them they produced no smell like that of an animal substance. The same
                  appearance had been observed upon the coast of Brazil and New Holland, but never
                  at any considerable distance from the shore. In the evening a small bird hovered
                  about the ship, and at night, settling among the rigging, was taken. It proved to
                  be exactly the same bird which Dampier has described, and of which he has given a
                  rude figure, by the name of a Noddy from New Holland. [See his Voyages, vol. iii.
                  p. 98. Tab. of Birds, Fig. 5.] </p><p n="1080"><pb n="653"/>We continued standing to the northward with a fresh gale at E. by E.
                  and S.E. till six in the evening,* having very irregular soundings, the depth
                  changing at once from twenty-four fathom to seven. At four, we had seen the land
                  from the mast-head, bearing N.W. by N.; it appeared to be very low, and to stretch
                  from W.N.W. to N.N.E. distant four or five leagues. We now hauled close upon a
                  wind till seven, then tacked and stood to the southward till twelve, at which time
                  we wore and stood to the northward till four in the morning, then laid the head of
                  the vessel off till day-light,* when we again saw the land, and stood in N.N.W.
                  directly for it, with a fresh gale at E. by S. Our soundings during the night were
                  very irregular from seven to five fathom, suddenly changing from deep to shallow,
                  and from shallow to deep, without in the least corresponding with our distance
                  from the land. At half an hour after six in the morning a small low island, which
                  lay at the distance of about a league from the main, bore N. by W. distant five
                  miles: this island lies in latitude <geo select="lat" n="144">8° 13′ S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="144">221° 25′
                     W</geo>.; and I find it laid down in the charts by the names of Bartholomew and
                  Whermoysen. We now steered N.W. by W. W.N.W. W. by N. W. by S. and S.W. by W. as
                  we found the land lie, with from five to nine fathom; and though we reckoned we
                  were not more than four leagues from it, yet it was so low and level that we could
                  but just see it from the deck. It appeared however to be well covered with wood,
                  and among other trees, we thought we could distinguish the cocoa-nut. We saw smoke
                  in several places, and therefore knew there were inhabitants. At noon we were
                  about three leagues from the land; the westermost part of which that was in sight
                  bore S. <geo select="lon">79° W</geo>. Our latitude by observation was <geo select="lat" n="145">8° 19′ S</geo>. and
                  longitude <geo select="lon" n="145">221° 44′ W</geo>. The island of St. Bartholomew bore N. 74 E.
                  distant 20 miles. </p><p n="1081"><pb n="654"/>*After steering S.W. by W. six miles, we had shoal water on our
                  starboard bow, which I sent the yawl to sound, and at the same time hauled off
                  upon a wind till four o'clock, and though during that time we had run six miles,
                  we had not deepened our water an inch. I then edged away S.W. four miles more; but
                  finding it still shoal water, I brought to and called the boats aboard. At this
                  time, being between three and four leagues from the shore, and the yawl having
                  found only three fathom water in the place to which I had sent her to sound, I
                  hauled off close upon a wind, and weathered the shoal about half a mile. </p><p n="1082">Between one and two o'clock, we passed a bay or inlet before which lies a
                  small island that seems to shelter it from the southerly winds; but I very much
                  doubt whether there is sufficient depth of water behind it for shipping. I could
                  not attempt to determine the question, because the S.E. trade wind blows right
                  into the bay, and we had not as yet had any breeze from the land. </p><p n="1083">We stretched off to sea till twelve o'clock, when we were about eleven
                  leagues from the land, and had deepened our water to twenty-nine fathom. We now
                  tacked and stood in till five in the morning;* when, being in six fathom and an
                  half, we tacked and laid the head of the vessel off till day-light, when we saw
                  the land, bearing N.W. by W. at about the distance of four leagues. We now made
                  sail, and steered first W.S.W. then W. by S.; but coming into five fathom and an
                  half, we hauled off S. W. till we deepened our water to eight fathom, and then
                  kept away W. by S. and W. having nine fathom, and the land just in sight from the
                  deck; we judged it to be about four leagues distant, and it was still very low and
                  woody. Great quantities of the brown scum continued to appear upon the water, and
                  the sailors, having <pb n="655"/> given up the notion of its being spawn,* found a
                  new name for it, and called it Sea-saw-dust. At noon, our latitude by observation
                  was <geo select="lat" n="146">8° 30′ S</geo>.; our longitude <geo select="lon" n="146">222° 34′ W</geo>.; and Saint
                  Bartholomew's isle bore N. 69 E. distant seventy-four miles. </p><p n="1084">As all this coast appears to have been very minutely examined by the
                  Dutch, and as our track with the soundings will appear by the chart, it is
                  sufficient to say, that we continued our course to the northward with very shallow
                  water, upon a bank of mud, at such a distance from the shore as that it could
                  scarcely be seen from the ship, till the <date>3d of September</date>. During this time we made
                  many attempts to get near enough to go on shore, but without success; and having
                  now lost six days of fair wind, at a time when we knew the south east monsoon to
                  be nearly at an end, we began to be impatient of farther delay, and determined to
                  run the ship in as near to the shore as possible, and then land with the pinnace,
                  while she kept plying off and on, to examine the produce of the country, and the
                  disposition of the inhabitants. For the two last days we had early in the morning
                  a light breeze from the shore, which was strongly impregnated with the fragrance
                  of the trees, shrubs, and herbage that covered it, the smell being something like
                  that of Gum Benjamin. On the <date>3d of September</date>, at day-break,* we saw the land
                  extending from N. by E. to S.E. at about four leagues distance, and we then kept
                  standing in for it with a fresh gale at E.S.E. and E. by S. till nine o'clock,
                  when being within about three or four miles of it, and in three fathom water, we
                  brought to. The pinnace being hoisted out, I set off from the ship with the boat's
                  crew, accompanied by Mr. Banks, who also took his servants, and Dr. Solander,
                  being in all twelve persons well armed; we rowed <pb n="656"/> directly towards
                  the shore,* but the water was so shallow that we could not reach it by about two
                  hundred yards: we waded however the rest of the way, having left two of the seamen
                  to take care of the boat. Hitherto we had seen no signs of inhabitants at this
                  place; but as soon as we got ashore we discovered the prints of human feet, which
                  could not long have been impressed upon the sand, as they were below high-water
                  mark: we therefore concluded that the people were at no great distance, and, as a
                  thick wood came down within a hundred yards of the water, we thought it necessary
                  to proceed with caution, lest we should fall into an ambuscade and our retreat to
                  the boat be cut off. We walked along the skirts of the wood, and at the distance
                  of about two hundred yards from the place where we landed, we came to a grove of
                  cocoa-nut trees, which stood upon the banks of a little brook of brackish water.
                  The trees were of a small growth, but well hung with fruit; and near them was a
                  shed or hut, which had been covered with their leaves, though most of them were
                  now fallen off: about the hut lay a great number of the shells of the fruit, some
                  of which appeared to be just fresh from the tree. We looked at the fruit very
                  wishfully, but not thinking it safe to climb, we were obliged to leave it without
                  tasting a single nut. At a little distance from this place we found plantains, and
                  a breadfruit tree, but it had nothing upon it; and having now advanced about a
                  quarter of a mile from the boat, three Indians rushed out of the wood with a
                  hideous shout, at about the distance of a hundred yards; and as they ran towards
                  us, the foremost threw something out of his hand, which slew on one side of him,
                  and burnt exactly like gunpowder, but made no report: the other two instantly
                  threw their lances at us; and, as no time was now to be lost, we discharged our
                     <pb n="657"/> pieces, which were loaded with small shot.* It is probable that
                  they did not feel the shot, for though they halted a moment, they did not retreat;
                  and a third dart was thrown at us. As we thought their farther approach might be
                  prevented with less risk of life, than it would cost to defend ourselves against
                  their attack if they should come nearer, we loaded our pieces with ball, and fired
                  a second time: by this discharge it is probable that some of them were wounded;
                  yet we had the satisfaction to see that they all ran away with great agility. As I
                  was not disposed forcibly to invade this country, either to gratify our appetites
                  or our curiosity, and perceived that nothing was to be done upon friendly terms,
                  we improved this interval, in which the destruction of the natives was no longer
                  necessary to our own defence, and with all expedition returned towards our boat.
                  As we were advancing along the shore, we perceived that the two men on board made
                  signals that more Indians were coming down; and before we got into the water we
                  saw several of them coming round a point at the distance of about five hundred
                  yards: it is probable that they had met with the three who first attacked us; for
                  as soon as they saw us they halted, and seemed to wait till their main body should
                  come up. We entered the water, and waded towards the boat; and they remained at
                  their station, without giving us any interruption. As soon as we were aboard we
                  rowed abreast of them, and their number then appeared to be between sixty and a
                  hundred. We now took a view of them at our leisure; they made much the same
                  appearance as the New Hollanders, being nearly of the same stature, and having
                  their hair short cropped: like them also they were all stark naked, but we thought
                  the colour of their skin was not quite so dark; this however might perhaps be
                  merely the effect of their not being quite so dirty. All this while they were
                  shouting defiance, <pb n="658"/> and letting off their fires by four or five at a
                  time.* What these fires were, or for what purpose intended, we could not imagine:
                  those who discharged them had in their hands a short piece of stick, possibly a
                  hollow cane, which they swung sideways from them, and we immediately saw fire and
                  smoke, exactly resembling those of a musquet, and of no longer duration. This
                  wonderful phaenomenon was observed from the ship, and the deception was so great
                  that the people on board thought they had fire-arms; and in the boat, if we had
                  not been so near as that we must have heard the report, we should have thought
                  they had been firing volleys. After we had looked at them attentively some time,
                  without taking any notice of their flashing and vociferation, we fired some
                  musquets over their heads: upon hearing the balls rattle among the trees, they
                  walked leisurely away, and we returned to the ship. Upon examining the weapons
                  they had thrown at us, we found them to be light darts, about four feet long, very
                  ill made, of a reed or bamboo cane, and pointed with hard wood, in which there
                  were many barbs. They were discharged with great force; for though we were at
                  sixty yards distance, they went beyond us, but in what manner we could not exactly
                  see: possibly they might be shot with a bow; but we saw no bows among them when we
                  surveyed them from the boat, and we were in general of opinion that they were
                  thrown with a stick, in the manner practised by the New Hollanders. </p><p n="1085">This place lies in the latitude of <geo select="lat">6° 15′ S</geo>. and about
                  sixty-five leagues to the N. E. of Port Saint Augustine, or Walche Caep, and is
                  near what is called in the charts C. de la Colta de St. Bonaventura. The land
                  here, like that in every other part of the coast is very low, but covered with a
                  luxuriance of wood and herbage that can scarcely be conceived. We saw <pb n="659"/> the cocoa-nut, the bread-fruit, and the plantain tree,* all flourishing in a
                  state of the highest perfection, though the cocoa-nuts were green, and the
                  bread-fruit not in season; besides most of the trees, shrubs, and plants that are
                  common to the South Sea islands, New Zealand, and New Holland. </p><p n="1086">Soon after our return to the ship, we hoisted in the boat and made sail
                  to the westward, being resolved to spend no more time upon this coast, to the
                  great satisfaction of a very considerable majority of the ship's company. But I am
                  sorry to say that I was strongly urged by some of the officers to send a party of
                  men ashore, and cut down the cocoa-nut trees for the sake of the fruit. This I
                  peremptorily refused, as equally unjust and cruel. The natives had attacked us
                  merely for landing upon their coast, when we attempted to take nothing away, and
                  it was therefore morally certain that they would have made a vigorous effort to
                  defend their property if it had been invaded, in which case many of them must have
                  fallen a sacrifice to our attempt, and perhaps also some of our own people. I
                  should have regretted the necessity of such a measure, if I had been in want of
                  the necessaries of life; and certainly it would have been highly criminal when
                  nothing was to be obtained but two or three hundred of green cocoa-nuts, which
                  would at most have procured us a mere transient gratification. I might indeed have
                  proceeded farther along the coast to the northward and westward, in search of a
                  place where the ship might have lain so near the shore as to cover the people with
                  her guns when they landed; but this would have obviated only part of the mischief,
                  and though it might have secured us, it would probably in the very act have been
                  fatal to the natives. Besides, we had reason to think that before such a <pb n="660"/> place would have been found,* we should have been carried so far to
                  the westward as to have been obliged to go to Batavia, on the north side of Java;
                  which I did not think so safe a passage as to the south of Java, through the
                  Streights of Sunday: the ship also was so leaky that I doubted whether it would
                  not be necessary to heave her down at Batavia, which was another reason for making
                  the best of our way to that place; especially as no discovery could be expected in
                  seas which had already been navigated, and where every coast had been laid down by
                  the Dutch geographers. The Spaniards indeed, as well as the Dutch, seem to have
                  circumnavigated all the islands in New Guinea, as almost every place that is
                  distinguished in the chart has a name in both languages. The charts with which I
                  compared such part of this coast as I visited, are bound up with a French work,
                  intitled, "Histoire des Navigationes aux Terres Australes," which was published in
                  1756, and I found them tolerably exact; yet I know not by whom, nor when they were
                  taken: and though New Holland and New Guinea are in them represented as two
                  distinct countries, the very history in which they are bound up, leaves it in
                  doubt. I pretend however to no more merit in this part of the voyage, than to have
                  established the fact beyond all controversy. </p><p n="1087">As the two countries lie very near each other, and the intermediate space
                  is full of islands, it is reasonable to suppose that they were both peopled from
                  one common stock: yet no intercourse appears to have been kept up between them;
                  for if there had, the cocoa-nuts, bread-fruit, plantains, and other fruits of New
                  Guinea, which are equally necessary for the support of life, would certainly have
                  been transplanted to New Holland, where no traces of them are to be found. The
                  Author of the "Histoire des Navigationes aux Terres Australes," <pb n="661"/> in
                  his account of La Maire's voyage,* has given a vocabulary of the language that is
                  spoken in an island near New Britain, and we find, by comparing that vocabulary
                  with the words which we learnt in New Holland, that the languages are not the
                  same. If therefore it should appear, that the languages of New Britain and New
                  Guinea are the same, there will be reason to suppose that New Britain and New
                  Guinea were peopled from a common stock; but that the inhabitants of New Holland
                  had a different origin, notwithstanding the proximity of the countries. </p></div><pb n="662"/><div type="chapter" n="38"><head><l>CHAP.X.</l><l><emph rend="italic"> The Passage from New Guinea to the Island of Savu, and the

                     W</geo>.; having been in soundings the whole time from ten to twenty fathom. </p><p n="1089">*At half an hour after one in the morning of the next day, we passed a
                  small island which bore from us N. N. W. distant between three and four miles; and
                  at day-light we discovered another low island, extending from N.N.W. to N.N.E.
                  distant about two or three leagues. Upon this island, which did not appear to be
                  very small, I believe I should have landed to examine its produce, if the wind had
                  not blown too fresh to admit of it. When we passed this island we had only ten
                  fathom water, with a rocky bottom; and therefore I was afraid of running down to
                  leeward, lest I should meet with shoal water and foul ground. These islands have
                  no place in the charts except they are the Arrou islands; and if <pb n="663"/>
                  these, they are laid down much too far from New Guinea.* I found the south part of
                  them to lie in latitude <geo select="lat" n="149">7° 6′ S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="149">225° W</geo>. </p><p n="1090">We continued to steer W. S. W. at the rate of four miles and an half an
                  hour, till ten o'clock at night, when we had forty-two fathom, at eleven we had
                  thirty-seven, at twelve forty-five, at one in the morning forty-nine, and at three
                  120, after which we had no ground. At day-light, we made all the sail we could,
                  and at ten o'clock, saw land, extending from N. N. W. to W. by N. distant between
                  five and six leagues: at noon, it bore from N. to W. and at about the same
                  distance: it appeared to be level, and of a moderate height: by our distance from
                  New Guinea, it ought to have been part of the Arrou Islands, but it lies a degree
                  farther to the south than any of these islands are laid down in the charts; and by
                  the latitude should be Timor Laoet: we sounded, but had no ground with fifty
                  fathom. </p><p n="1091">As I was not able to satisfy myself from any chart, what land it was that
                  I saw to leeward, and fearing that it might trend away more southerly, the weather
                  also being so hazy that we could not see far, I steered S. W. and by four had lost
                  sight of the island. I was now sure that no part of it lay to the southward of
                  <geo select="lat">8° 15′ S</geo>. and continued standing to the S. W. with an easy sail, and
                  a fresh breeze at S. E. by E. and E. S. E.: we sounded every hour, but had no
                  bottom with 120 fathom. </p><p n="1092">At day-break in the morning,* we steered W. S. W. and afterwards W. by S.
                  which by noon brought us into the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="150">9° 30′ S</geo>. longitude
                  <geo select="lon" n="150">229° 34′ W</geo>. and by our run from New Guinea, we ought to have been
                  within sight of Weasel Isles, which in the charts are laid down at the distance of
                  twenty or twenty-five leagues from the coast of New Holland; <pb n="664"/> we
                  however saw nothing,* and therefore they must have been placed erroneously; nor
                  can this be thought strange, when it is considered that not only these islands,
                  but the coast which bounds this sea, have been discovered and explored by
                  different people, and at different times, and the charts upon which they are
                  delineated, put together by others, perhaps at the distance of more than a century
                  after the discoveries had been made; not to mention that the discoverers
                  themselves had not all the requisites for keeping an accurate journal, of which
                  those of the present age are possessed. </p><p n="1093">*We continued our course, steering W. till the evening of the <date>8th</date>, when

                  5′ W. At noon, on the <date>9th</date>,* our latitude, by observation, was <geo select="lat" n="151">9° 46′
                     S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="151">232° 7′ W</geo>. For the last two days we had steered due
                  W. yet, by observation, we made sixteen miles southing, six miles from noon on the
                  <date>6th</date> to noon on the <date>7th</date>, and ten miles from noon on the <date>7th</date> to noon on the <date>8th</date>, by
                  which it appeared that there was a current setting to the southward. At sunset, we
                  found the variation to be 2 W. and at the same time, saw an appearance of very
                  high land bearing N. W. </p><p n="1094">*In the morning of the <date>10th</date>, we saw clearly that what had appeared to be
                  land the night before, was Timor. At noon, our latitude, by observation, was
                  <geo select="lat" n="152">10° 1′ S</geo>. which was fifteen miles to the southward of that given by
                  the log; our longitude, by observation, was <geo select="lon" n="152">233° 27′ W</geo>. We steered N.
                  W. in order to obtain a more distinct view of the land in sight, till four o'clock
                  in the morning of the <date>11th</date>,* when the wind came to the N. W. and W. with which we
                  stood to the southward till nine, when we tacked and stood N. W. having the wind
                  now at W. S. W. At sun-rise, the land had appeared to extend from W. N. W. to N.
                  E. and at noon, we could see it <pb n="665"/> extend to the westward as far as W.
                  by S. ½ S. but no farther to the eastward than N. by E. We were now well assured,*
                  that as the first land we had seen was Timor, the last island we had passed was
                  Timor Laoet, or Laut. Laoet, is a word in the language of Malaca, signifying Sea,
                  and this island was named by the inhabitants of that country. The south part of it
                  lies in latitude <geo select="lat">8°</geo><geo select="lat">15° S</geo>. longitude <geo select="lon">228° 10′ W</geo>. but in the charts the south
                  point is laid down in various latitudes, from <geo select="lat">8° 30′</geo> to <geo select="lat">9°
                     30′</geo>: it is indeed possible that the land we saw might be some other
                  island, but the presumption to the contrary is very strong, for if Timor Laut had
                  lain where it is placed in the charts, we must have seen it there. We were now in
                  latitude <geo select="lat" n="153">9° 37′ S</geo>.; longitude, by an observation of the sun and moon,
                  <geo select="lon" n="153">233° 54′ W</geo>. we were the day before in <geo select="lon">233° 27′</geo>; the
                  difference is 27′, exactly the same that was given by the log: this, however, is a
                  degree of accuracy in observation that is seldom to be expected. In the afternoon,
                  we stood in shore till eight in the evening, when we tacked and stood off, being
                  at the distance of about three leagues from the land, which at sun-set extended
                  from S. W. ½ W. to N. E.: at this time we sounded, and had no ground with 140
                  fathom. At midnight, having but little wind,* we tacked and stood in, and at noon
                  the next day, our latitude, by observation, was <geo select="lat">9° 36′ S</geo>. This day, we
                  saw smoke on shore in several places, and had seen many fires during the night.
                  The land appeared to be very high, rising in gradual slopes one above another: the
                  hills were in general covered with thick woods, but among them we could
                  distinguish naked spots of a considerable extent, which had the appearance of
                  having been cleared by art. At five o'clock in the afternoon, we were within a
                  mile and a half of the shore, in sixteen fathom water, and abreast of a small
                  inlet into the low land, which lies in latitude <geo select="lat">9° 34′S</geo>. and probably
                  is the same that <pb n="666"/> Dampier entered with his boat,* for it did not seem
                  to have sufficient depth of water for a ship. The land here answered well to the
                  description that he has given of it: close to the beach it was covered with high
                  spiry trees, which he mentions as having the appearance of pines; behind these
                  there seemed to be salt water creeks, and many mangroves, interspersed however
                  with cocoa-nut trees: the flat land at the beach appeared in some places to extend
                  inward two or three miles before the rise of the first hill; in this part,
                  however, we saw no appearance of plantations or houses, but great fertility, and
                  from the number of fires, we judged that the place must be well peopled. </p><p n="1095">When we had approached within a mile and an half of the shore, we tacked
                  and stood off, and the extreams of the coast then extended from N. E. by E. to W.
                  by S. ½ S. The south westerly extremity was a low point, distant from us about
                  three leagues. While we were standing in for the shore, we sounded several times,
                  but had no ground till we came within about two miles and a half, and then we had
                  five and twenty fathom, with a soft bottom. After we had tacked, we stood off till
                  midnight, with the wind at S.; we then tacked and stood two hours to the westward,
                  when the wind veered to S. W. and W. S. W. and we then stood to the southward
                  again.* In the morning, we found the variation to be <geo select="lon">1° 10′ W</geo>. by the
                  amplitude, and by the azimuth <geo select="lon">1° 27′</geo>. At noon, our latitude was, by
                  observation, <geo select="lat" n="154">9° 45′ S</geo>. our longitude <geo select="lon" n="154">234° 12′W</geo>.; we were
                  then about seven leagues distant from the land, which extended from N. 31 E. to W.
                  S. W. ½ W. </p><p n="1096">With light land breezes from W. by N. for a few hours in a morning, and
                  sea breezes from S. S. W. and S. we advanced to the westward but slowly.* At noon
                  on the <date>14th</date>, we were between six and seven leagues from the land, which extended
                     <pb n="667"/> from N. by E. to S. 78 W.;* we still saw smoke in many places by
                  day, and sire by night, both upon the low land and the mountains beyond it. We
                  continued steering along the shore, till the morning of the <date>15th</date>,* the land still
                  appearing hilly, but not so high as it had been: the hills in general came quite
                  down to the sea, and where they did not, we saw instead of flats and mangrove
                  land, immense groves of cocoa-nut trees, reaching about a mile up from the beach:
                  there the plantations and houses commenced, and appeared to be innumerable. The
                  houses were shaded by groves of the fan palm, or borassus, and the plantations,
                  which were inclosed by a fence, reached almost to the tops of the highest hills.
                  We saw however neither people nor cattle, though our glasses were continually
                  employed, at which we were not a little surprised. </p><p n="1097">We continued our course, with little variation, till nine o'clock in the
                  morning of the <date>16th</date>,* when we saw the small island called ROTTE; and at noon, the
                  island SEMAU, lying off the south end of Timor, bore N. W. </p><p n="1098">Dampier, who has given a large description of the island of Timor, says,
                  that it is seventy leagues long, and sixteen broad, and that it lies nearly N. E.
                  and S. W. I found the east side of it to lie nearest N. E. by E. and S. W. by W.
                  and the south end to lie in latitude <geo select="lat" n="155">10° 23′ S</geo>. longitude <geo select="lon" n="155">236° 5′
                     W</geo>. We ran about forty-five leagues along the east side, and found the
                  navigation altogether free from danger. The land which is bounded by the sea,
                  except near the south end, is low for two or three miles within the beach, and in
                  general intersected by salt creeks: behind the low land are mountains, which rise
                  one above another to a considerable height. We steered W. N. W. till two in the
                  afternoon, when, being within a small distance of the north end of Rotte, we
                  hauled <pb n="668"/> up N. N. W. in order to go between it and Semau:* after
                  steering three leagues upon this course, we edged away N. W. and W. and by six, we
                  were clear of all the islands. At this time, the south part of Semau, which lies
                  in latitude <geo select="lat">10° 15′ S</geo>. bore N. E. distant four leagues, and the island
                  of Rotte extended as far to the southward as S. 36 W. The north end of this
                  island, and the south end of Timor, lie N. ½ E. and S. ½ W. and are about three or
                  four leagues distant from each other. At the west end of the passage between Rotte
                  and Semau, are two small islands, one of which lies near the Rotte shore, and the
                  other off the south west point of Semau: there is a good channel between them,
                  about six miles broad, through which we passed. The isle of Rotte has not so lofty
                  and mountainous an appearance as Timor, though it is agreeably diversified by hill
                  and valley: on the north side, there are many sandy beaches, near which grew some
                  trees of the fan palm, but the far greater part was covered with a kind of brushy
                  wood, that was without leaves. The appearance of Semau was nearly the same with
                  that of Timor, but not quite so high. About ten o'clock at night, we observed a
                  phaenomenon in the heavens, which in many particulars resembled the aurora
                  borealis, and in others, was very different: it consisted of a dull reddish light,
                  and reached about twenty degrees above the horizon: its extent was very different
                  at different times, but it was never less than eight or ten points of the compass:
                  through, and out of this, passed rays of light of a brighter colour, which
                  vanished, and were renewed nearly in the same time as those of the aurora
                  borealis, but had no degree of the tremulous or vibratory motion which is observed
                  in that phaenomenon: the body of it bore S. S. E. from the ship, and it continued,
                  without any diminution of its brightness, till twelve o'clock, <pb n="669"/> when
                  we retired to sleep, but how long afterwards,* I cannot tell. </p><p n="1099">Being clear of all the islands,* which are laid down in the maps we had
                  on board, between Timor and Java, we steered a west course till six o'clock the
                  next morning, when we unexpectedly saw an island bearing W. S. W. and at first I
                  thought we had made a new discovery. We steered directly for it, and by ten
                  o'clock were close in with the north side of it, where we saw houses, cocoa-nut
                  trees, and, to our very agreeable surprise, numerous flocks of sheep. This was a
                  temptation not to be resisted by people in our situation, especially as many of us
                  were in a bad state of health, and many still repining at my not having touched at
                  Timor: it was therefore soon determined to attempt a commerce with people who
                  appeared to be so well able to supply our many necessities, and remove at once the
                  sickness and discontent that had got footing among us. The pinnace was hoisted
                  out, and Mr. Gore, the Second Lieutenant, sent to see if there was any convenient
                  place to land, taking with him some trifles, as presents to the natives, if any of
                  them should appear. While he was gone, we saw from the ship two men on horseback,
                  who seemed to be riding upon the hills for their amusement, and often stopped to
                  look at the ship. By this we knew that the place had been settled by Europeans,
                  and hoped, that the many disagreeable circumstances which always attend the first
                  establishment of commerce with savages, would be avoided. In the mean time, Mr.
                  Gore landed in a small sandy cove near some houses, and was met by eight or ten of
                  the natives, who, as well in their dress as their persons, very much resembled the
                  Malays: they were without arms, except the knives which it is their custom to wear
                  in their girdles, and one of them had a jack ass with him: they courteously
                  invited him ashore, and conversed <pb n="670"/> with him by signs,* but very
                  little of the meaning of either party could be understood by the other. In a short
                  time he returned with this report, and, to our great mortification, added, that
                  there was no anchorage for the ship. I sent him however a second time, with both
                  money and goods, that he might, if possible, purchase some refreshments, at least
                  for the sick; and Dr. Solander went in the boat with him. In the mean time I kept
                  standing on and off with the ship, which at this time was within about a mile of
                  the shore. Before the boat could land, we saw two other horsemen, one of whom was
                  in a complete European dress, consisting of a blue coat, a white waistcoat, and a
                  laced hat: these people, when the boat came to the shore, took little notice of
                  her, but sauntered about, and seemed to look with great curiosity at the ship. We
                  saw however other horsemen, and a great number of persons on foot, gather round
                  our people, and, to our great satisfaction, perceived several cocoa-nuts carried
                  into the boat, from which we concluded that peace and commerce were established
                  between us. </p><p n="1100">After the boat had been ashore about an hour and a half, she made the
                  signal for having intelligence that there was a bay to leeward, where we might
                  anchor: we stood away directly for it, and the boat following, soon came on board.
                  The Lieutenant told us, that he had seen some of the principal people, who were
                  dressed in fine linen, and had chains of gold round their necks: he said, that he
                  had not been able to trade, because the owner of the cocoa-nuts was absent, but
                  that about two dozen had been sent to the boat as a present, and that some linen
                  had been accepted in return. The people, to give him the information that he
                  wanted, drew a map upon the sand, in which they made a rude representation of a
                  harbour to leeward, and a town near it: they also gave him to understand, that
                  sheep, hogs, fowls, <pb n="671"/> and fruit might there be procured in great
                  plenty.* Some of them frequently pronounced the word Portuguese, and said
                  something of Larntuca, upon the island of Ende: from this circumstance, we
                  conjectured that there were Portuguese somewhere upon the island, and a
                  Portuguese, who was in our boat, attempted to converse with the Indians in that
                  language, but soon found that they knew only a word or two of it by rote: one of
                  them however, when they were giving our people to understand that there was a town
                  near the harbour to which they had directed us, intimated, that as a token of
                  going right, we should see somewhat, which he expressed by crossing his fingers,
                  and the Portuguese instantly conceived that he meant to express a cross. Just as
                  our people were putting off, the horseman in the European dress came up, but the
                  officer not having his commission about him, thought it best to decline a
                  conference. </p><p n="1101">At seven o'clock in the evening, we came to an anchor in the bay to which
                  we had been directed, at about the distance of a mile from the shore, in
                  thirty-eight fathom water, with a clear sandy bottom. The north point of the bay
                  bore N. 30 E. distant two miles and an half, and the south point, or west end of
                  the island, bore S. 63 W. Just as we got round the north point, and entered the
                  bay, we discovered a large Indian town or village, upon which we stood on,
                  hoisting a jack on the fore top-mast head: soon after, to our great surprize,
                  Dutch colours were hoisted in the town, and three guns fired; we stood on,
                  however, till we had soundings, and then anchored. </p><p n="1102">As soon as it was light in the morning,* we saw the same colours hoisted
                  upon the beach, abreast of the ship; supposing therefore that the Dutch had a
                  settlement here, I sent Lieutenant Gore ashore, to wait upon the Governor, or the
                     <pb n="672"/> chief person residing upon the spot,* and acquaint him who we
                  were, and for what purpose we had touched upon the coast. As soon as he came
                  ashore, he was received by a guard of between twenty and thirty Indians, armed
                  with muskets, who conducted him to the town, where the colours had been hoisted
                  the night before, carrying with them those that had been hoisted upon the beach,
                  and marching without any military regularity. As soon as he arrived, he was
                  introduced to the Raja, or King of the island, and by a Portuguese interpreter,
                  told him, that the ship was a man of war belonging to the King of Great Britain,
                  and that she had many sick on board, for whom he wanted to purchase such
                  refreshments as the island afforded. His Majesty replied, that he was willing to
                  supply us with whatever we wanted, but, that being in alliance with the Dutch East
                  India Company, he was not at liberty to trade with any other people, without
                  having first procured their consent, for which, however, he said he would
                  immediately apply to a Dutchman who belonged to the company, and who was the only
                  white man upon the island. To this man, who resided at some distance, a letter was
                  immediately dispatched, acquainting him with our arrival and request: in the mean
                  time, Mr. Gore dispatched a messenger to me, with an account of his situation, and
                  the state of the treaty. In about three hours, the Dutch resident answered the
                  letter that had been sent him, in person: he proved to be a native of Saxony, and
                  his name is Johan Christopher Lange, and the same person whom we had seen on
                  horseback in a European dress: he behaved with great civility to Mr. Gore, and
                  assured him, that we were at liberty to purchase of the natives whatever we
                  pleased. After a short time, he expressed a desire of coming on board, so did the
                  king also, and several of his attendants: Mr. Gore intimated that he was ready to
                  attend them, but <pb n="673"/> they desired that two of our people might be left
                  ashore as hostages, and in this also they were indulged.* </p><p n="1103">About two o'clock, they all came aboard the ship, and our dinner being
                  ready, they accepted our invitation to partake of it: I expected them immediately
                  to sit down, but the King seemed to hesitate, and at last, with some confusion,
                  said he did not imagine that we, who were white men, would suffer him, who was of
                  a different colour, to sit down in our company; a compliment soon removed his
                  scruples, and we all sat down together with great cheerfulness and cordiality:
                  happily we were at no loss for interpreters, both Dr. Solander and Mr. Sporing
                  understanding Dutch enough to keep up a conversation with Mr. Lange, and several
                  of the seamen were able to converse with such of the natives as spoke Portuguese.
                  Our dinner happened to be mutton, and the King expressed a desire of having an
                  English sheep; we had but one left, however that was presented to him: the
                  facility with which this was procured, encouraged him to ask for an English dog,
                  and Mr. Banks politely gave up his greyhound: Mr. Lange then intimated that a
                  spying-glass would be acceptable, and one was immediately put into his hand. Our
                  guests then told us that the island abounded with buffaloes, sheep, hogs, and
                  fowls, plenty of which should be driven down to the beach the next day, that we
                  might purchase as many of them as we should think fit: this put us all into high
                  spirits, and the liquor circulated rather faster than either the Indians or the
                  Saxon could bear; they intimated their desire to go away, however, before they
                  were quite drunk, and were received upon deck, as they had been when they came
                  aboard, by the marines under arms. The King expressed a curiosity to see them
                  exercise, in which he was gratified, and they sired three rounds: he looked at
                  them with great attention, and was much surprised at their <pb n="674"/>
                  regularity and expedition,* especially in cocking their pieces; the first time
                  they did it, he struck the side of the ship with a stick that he had in his hand,
                  and cried out with great vehemence, that all the locks made but one click. They
                  were dismissed with many presents, and when they went away saluted with nine guns:
                  Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander went ashore with them; and as soon as they put off they
                  gave us three cheers. </p><p n="1104">Our Gentlemen, when they came ashore, walked up with them to the town,
                  which consists of many houses, and some of them are large; they are however
                  nothing more than a thatched roof, supported over a boarded floor, by pillars
                  about four feet high. They produced some of their palm-wine, which was the fresh
                  unfermented juice of the tree; it had a sweet, but not a disagreeable taste; and
                  hopes were conceived that it might contribute to recover our sick from the scurvy.
                  Soon after it was dark, Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander returned on board. </p><p n="1105">*In the morning of the <date>19th</date>, I went ashore with Mr. Banks, and several of
                  the officers and Gentlemen, to return the King's visit; but my chief business was
                  to procure some of the buffaloes, sheep and fowls, which we had been told should
                  be driven down to the beach. We were greatly mortified to find that no steps had
                  been taken to fulfil this promise; however, we proceeded to the house of assembly,
                  which with two or three more had been erected by the Dutch East India company, and
                  are distinguished from the rest by two pieces of wood resembling a pair of cow's
                  horns, one of which is set up at each end of the ridge that terminates the roof;
                  and these were certainly what the Indian intended to represent by crossing his
                  fingers, though our Portuguese, who was a good Catholic, construed the sign into a
                     <pb n="675"/> cross,* which had persuaded us that the settlement belonged to
                  his countrymen. In this place we met Mr. Lange, and the King, whose name was A
                  Madocho Lomi Djara, attended by many of the principal people. We told them that we
                  had in the boat goods of various kinds, which we proposed to barter for such
                  refreshments as they would give us in exchange, and desired leave to bring them on
                  shore; which being granted, they were brought ashore accordingly. We then
                  attempted to settle the price of the buffaloes, sheep, hogs, and other commodities
                  which we proposed to purchase, and for which we were to pay in money; but as soon
                  as this was mentioned Mr. Lange left us, telling us that these preliminaries must
                  be settled with the natives: he said, however, that he had received a letter from
                  the Governor of Concordia in Timor, the purport of which he would communicate to
                  us when he returned. </p><p n="1106">As the morning was now far advanced, and we were very unwilling to return
                  on board and eat salt provisions, when so many delicacies surrounded us ashore, we
                  petitioned his Majesty for liberty to purchase a small hog and some rice, and to
                  employ his subjects to dress them for us. He answered very graciously, that if we
                  could eat victuals dressed by his subjects, which he could scarcely suppose, he
                  would do himself the honour of entertaining us. We expressed our gratitude, and
                  immediately sent on board for liquors. </p><p n="1107">About five o'clock, dinner was ready; it was served in six and thirty
                  dishes, or rather baskets, containing alternately rice and pork; and three bowls
                  of earthen ware, filled with the liquor in which the pork had been boiled: these
                  were ranged upon the floor, and mats laid round them for us to sit upon. We were
                  then conducted by turns to a hole in the floor, near which stood a man with water
                  in a vessel, made <pb n="676"/> of the leaves of the fan-palm,* who assisted us in
                  washing our hands. When this was done, we placed ourselves round the victuals, and
                  waited for the king. As he did not come, we enquired for him, and were told that
                  the custom of the country did not permit the person who gave the entertainment to
                  sit down with his guests; but that, if we suspected the victuals to be poisoned,
                  he would come and taste it. We immediately declared that we had no such suspicion,
                  and desired that none of the rituals of hospitality might be violated on our
                  account. The prime minister and Mr. Lange were of our party, and we made a most
                  luxurious meal: we thought the pork and rice excellent, and the broth not to be
                  despised; but the spoons, which were made of leaves, were so small that few of us
                  had patience to use them. After dinner, our wine passed briskly about, and we
                  again enquired for our royal host, thinking that though the custom of his country
                  would not allow him to eat with us, he might at least share in the jollity of our
                  bottle; but he again excused himself, saying, that the master of a feast should
                  never be drunk, which there was no certain way to avoid but by not tasting the
                  liquor. We did not however drink our wine where we had eaten our victuals; but as
                  soon as we had dined made room for the seamen and servants, who immediately took
                  our places: they could not dispatch all that we had left, but the women who came
                  to clear away the bowls and baskets, obliged them to carry away with them what
                  they had not eaten. As wine generally warms and opens the heart, we took an
                  opportunity, when we thought its influence began to be felt, to revive the subject
                  of the buffaloes and sheep, of which we had not in all this time heard a syllable,
                  though they were to have been brought down early in the morning. But our Saxon
                  Dutchman, with great phlegm, began to communicate to us the contents of the letter
                  which he pretended to <pb n="677"/> have received from the Governor of Concordia.
                  He said,* that after acquainting him that a vessel had steered from thence towards
                  the island where we were now ashore, it required him, if such ship should apply
                  for provisions in distress, to relieve her; but not to suffer her to stay longer
                  than was absolutely necessary, nor to make any large presents to the inferior
                  people, or to leave any with those of superior rank to be afterwards distributed
                  among them: but he was graciously pleased to add, that we were at liberty to give
                  beads and other trifles in exchange for petty civilities, and palm-wine. </p><p n="1108">It was the general opinion that this letter was a fiction; that the
                  prohibitory orders were feigned with a view to get money from us for breaking
                  them; and that by precluding our liberality to the natives, this man hoped more
                  easily to turn it into another channel. </p><p n="1109">In the evening, we received intelligence from our trading-place that no
                  buffaloes or hogs had been brought down, and only a few sheep, which had been
                  taken away before our people, who had sent for money, could procure it. Some fowls
                  however had been bought, and a large quantity of a kind of syrup made of the juice
                  of the palm tree, which, though infinitely superior to molasses or treacle, sold
                  at a very low price. We complained of our disappointment to Mr. Lange, who had now
                  another subterfuge; he said, that if we had gone down to the beach ourselves, we
                  might have purchased what we pleased; but that the natives were afraid to take
                  money of our people, lest it should be counterfeit. We could not but feel some
                  indignation against a man who had concealed this, being true; or alleged it, being
                  false. I started up, however, and went immediately to the beach, but no cattle or
                  sheep were to be seen, nor were any at hand <pb n="678"/> to be produced.* While I
                  was gone, Lange, who knew well enough that I should succeed no better than my
                  people, told Mr. Banks that the natives were displeased at our not having offered
                  them gold for their stock; and that if gold was not offered, nothing would be
                  bought. Mr. Banks did not think it worth his while to reply, but soon after rose
                  up, and we all returned on board, very much dissatisfied with the issue of our
                  negociations. During the course of the day, the King had promised that some cattle
                  and sheep should be brought down in the morning, and had given a reason for our
                  disappointment somewhat more plausible; he said that the buffaloes were far up the
                  country, and that there had not been time to bring them down to the beach. </p><p n="1110">*The next morning we went ashore again: Dr. Solander went up to the town
                  to speak to Lange, and I remained upon the beach, to see what could be done in the
                  purchase of provisions. I found here an old Indian, who, as he appeared to have
                  some authority, we had among ourselves called the Prime Minister; to engage this
                  man in our interest I presented him with a spying-glass, but I saw nothing at
                  market except one small buffalo. I enquired the price of it, and was told five
                  guineas: this was twice as much as it was worth; however, I offered three, which I
                  could perceive the man who treated with me thought a good price; but he said that
                  he must acquaint the King with what I had offered before he could take it. A
                  messenger was immediately dispatched to his Majesty, who soon returned, and said,
                  that the buffalo would not be sold for any thing less than five guineas. This
                  price I absolutely refused to give; and another messenger was sent away with an
                  account of my refusal: this messenger was longer absent than the other, and while
                  I was waiting for his return I saw, to my great astonishment, Dr. <pb n="679"/>
                  Solander coming from the town,* followed by above a hundred men, some armed with
                  musquets and some with lances. When I enquired the meaning of this hostile
                  appearance, the Doctor told me, that Mr. Lange had interpreted to him a message
                  from the King, purporting that the people would not trade with us, because we had
                  refused to give them more than half the value of what they had to sell; and that
                  we should not be permitted to trade upon any terms longer than this day. Besides
                  the officers who commanded the party, there came with it a man who was born at
                  Timor, of Portuguese parents, and who, as we afterwards discovered, was a kind of
                  colleague to the Dutch factor; by this man what they pretended to be the King's
                  order was delivered to me, of the same purport with that which Dr. Solander had
                  received from Lange. We were all clearly of opinion that this was a mere artifice
                  of the factors to extort money from us, for which we had been prepared by the
                  account of a letter from Concordia; and while we were hesitating what step to
                  take, the Portuguese, that he might the sooner accomplish his purpose, began to
                  drive away the people who had brought down poultry and syrup, and others that were
                  now coming in with buffaloes and sheep. At this time, I glanced my eye upon the
                  old man whom I had complimented in the morning with the spying-glass, and I
                  thought, by his looks, that he did not heartily approve of what was doing; I
                  therefore took him by the hand, and presented him with an old broad sword. This
                  instantly turned the scale in our favour; he received the sword with a transport
                  of joy, and flourishing it over the busy Portuguese, who crouched like a fox to a
                  lion, he made him, and the officer who commanded the party, sit down upon the
                  ground behind him: the people, who, whatever were the crafty pretences of these
                  iniquitous factors for a Dutch company, <pb n="680"/> were eager to supply us with
                  whatever we wanted,* and seemed also to be more desirous of goods than money,
                  instantly improved the advantage that had been procured them, and the market was
                  stocked almost in an instant. To establish a trade for buffaloes, however, which I
                  most wanted, I found it necessary to give ten guineas for two, one of which
                  weighed no more than a hundred and sixty pounds; but I bought seven more much
                  cheaper, and might afterwards have purchased as many as I pleased almost upon my
                  own terms, for they were now driven down to the waterside in herds. In the first
                  two that I bought so dear, Lange had certainly a share, and it was in hopes to
                  obtain part of the price of others, that he had pretended we must pay for them in
                  gold. The natives however sold what they afterwards brought down much to their
                  satisfaction, without paying part of the price to him as a reward for exacting
                  money from us. Most of the buffaloes that we bought, after our friend, the Prime
                  Minister, had procured us a fair market, were sold for a musquet apiece, and at
                  this price we might have bought as many as would have freighted our ship. </p><p n="1111">The refreshments which we procured here, consisted of nine buffaloes, six
                  sheep, three hogs, thirty dozen of fowls, a few limes, and some cocoa-nuts; many
                  dozen of eggs, half of which however proved to be rotten; a little garlic, and
                  several hundred gallons of palm-syrup. </p></div><pb n="681"/><div type="chapter" n="39"><head><l>CHAP.XI.</l><l><emph rend="italic"> A particular Description of the Island of Savu, its
                        Produce and Inhabitants, with a Specimen of their Language.</emph></l></head><p n="1112">THIS island is called by the natives SAVU;* the middle of it lies in
                  about the latitude <geo select="lat" n="156">10° 35′ S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="156">237° 30′ W</geo>.; and
                  has in general been so little known that I never saw a map or chart in which it is
                  clearly or accurately laid down. I have seen a very old one, in which it is called
                  Sou, and confounded with Sandel Bosch. Rumphius mentions an island by the name of
                  Saow; and he also says that it is the same which the Dutch call Sandel Bosch: but
                  neither is this island, nor Timor, nor Rotte, nor indeed any one of the islands
                  that we have seen in these seas, placed within a reasonable distance of its true
                  situation. It is about eight leagues long from east to west; but what is its
                  breadth, I do not know, as I saw only the north side. The harbour in which we lay
                  is called Seba, from the district in which it lies: it is on the north west side
                  of the island, and well sheltered from the south west trade wind, but it lies open
                  to the north west. We were told, that there were two other bays where ships might
                  anchor; that the best, called Timo, was on the south west side of the south east
                  point: of the third we learnt neither the name nor situation. The sea-coast, in
                  general, is low; but in the middle of the island there are hills of a considerable
                  height. We were upon the coast at the latter end of the dry season, when there had
                  been no rain for seven months; and we were told that when the dry season continues
                     <pb n="682"/> so long,* there is no running stream of fresh water upon the
                  whole island, but only small springs, which are at a considerable distance from
                  the sea-side: yet nothing can be imagined so beautiful as the prospect of the
                  country from the ship. The level ground next to the sea-side was covered with
                  cocoa-nut trees, and a kind of palm called Arecas; and beyond them the hills,
                  which rose in a gentle and regular ascent, were richly clothed, quite to the
                  summit, with plantations of the fan-palm, forming an almost impenetrable grove.
                  How much even this prospect must be improved, when every foot of ground between
                  the trees is covered with verdure, by maize, and millet and indico, can scarcely
                  be conceived but by a powerful imagination, not unacquainted with the stateliness
                  and beauty of the trees that adorn this part of the earth. The dry season
                  commences in March or April, and ends in October or November. </p><p n="1113">The principal trees of this island, are the fan-palm, the cocoa-nut,
                  tamarind, limes, oranges, and mangoes; the other vegetable productions are maize,
                  Guinea corn, rice, millet, callevances, and water-melons. We saw also one
                  sugar-cane, and a few kinds of European garden-stuff; particularly cellery,
                  marjoram, fennel, and garlic. For the supply of luxury, it has betele, areca,
                  tobacco, cotton, indico, and a small quantity of cinnamon, which seems to be
                  planted here only for curiosity; and indeed we doubted whether it was the genuine
                  plant, knowing that the Dutch are very careful not to trust the spices out of
                  their proper islands. There are however several kinds of fruit, besides those
                  which have been already mentioned; particularly the sweet sop, which is well known
                  to the West Indians, and a small oval fruit, called the Blimbi, both of which grow
                  upon trees. The blimbi is about three or four inches long, and <pb n="683"/> in
                  the middle about as thick as a man's finger,* tapering towards each end: it is
                  covered with a very thin skin of a light green colour, and in the inside are a few
                  feeds disposed in the form of a star: its flavour is a light, clean, pleasant
                  acid, but it cannot be eaten raw; it is said to be excellent as a pickle; and
                  stewed, it made a most agreeable sour sauce to our boiled dishes. </p><p n="1114">The tame animals are buffaloes, sheep, goats, hogs, fowls, pigeons,
                  horses, asses, dogs and cats; and of all these there is great plenty. The
                  buffaloes differ very considerably from the horned cattle of Europe in several
                  particulars; their ears are much larger, their skins are almost without hair,
                  their horns are curved towards each other, but together bend directly backwards,
                  and they have no dewlaps. We saw several that were as big as a well grown European
                  ox, and there must be some much larger; for Mr. Banks saw a pair of horns which
                  measured from tip to tip three feet nine inches and an half, across their widest
                  diameter four feet one inch and an half, and in the whole sweep of their
                  semicircle in front seven feet six inches and a half. It must however be observed,
                  that a buffalo here of any given size, does not weigh above half as much as an ox
                  of the same size in England: those that we guessed to weigh four hundred weight
                  did not weigh more than two hundred and fifty; the reason is, that so late in the
                  dry season the bones are very thinly covered with flesh: there is not an ounce of
                  fat in a whole carcass, and the flanks are literally nothing but skin and bone:
                  the flesh however is well tasted and juicy, and I suppose better than the flesh of
                  an English ox would be if he was to starve in this sun-burnt country. </p><p n="1115">The horses are from eleven to twelve hands high, but though they are
                  small, they are spirited and nimble, especially <pb n="684"/> in pacing,* which is
                  their common step: the inhabitants generally ride them without a saddle, and with
                  no better bridle than a halter. The sheep are of the kind which in England are
                  called Bengal sheep, and differ from ours in many particulars. They are covered
                  with hair instead of wool, their ears are very large, and hang down under their
                  horns, and their noses are arched; they are thought to have a general resemblance
                  to a goat, and for that reason are frequently called cabritos: their flesh we
                  thought the worst mutton we had ever eaten, being as lean as that of the
                  buffalo's, and without flavour. The hogs, however, were some of the fattest we had
                  ever seen, though, as we were told, their principal food is the outside husks of
                  rice, and the palm syrup dissolved in water. The fowls are chiefly of the game
                  breed, and large, but the eggs are remarkably small. </p><p n="1116">Of the fish which the sea produces here, we know but little: turtles are
                  sometimes found upon the coast, and are by these people, as well as all others,
                  considered as a dainty. </p><p n="1117">The people are rather under, than over the middling size; the women
                  especially are remarkably short and squat built: their complexion is a dark brown,
                  and their hair universally black and lank. We saw no difference in the colour of
                  rich and poor, though in the South Sea islands those that were exposed to the
                  weather were almost as brown as the New Hollanders, and the better sort nearly as
                  fair as the natives of Europe. The men are in general well-made, vigorous, and
                  active, and have a greater variety in the make and disposition of their features
                  than usual; the countenances of the women, on the contrary, are all alike. </p><p n="1118">The men fasten their hair up to the top of their heads with a comb, the
                  women tie it behind in a club, which is <pb n="685"/> very far from becoming.*
                  Both sexes eradicate the hair from under the arm, and the men do the same by their
                  beards, for which purpose, the better sort always carry a pair of silver pincers
                  hanging by a string round their necks; some however suffer a very little hair to
                  remain upon their upper lips, but this is always kept short. </p><p n="1119">The dress of both sexes consists of cotton cloth, which being died blue
                  in the yarn, and not uniformly of the same shade, is in clouds or waves of that
                  colour, and even in our eye had not an inelegant appearance. This cloth they
                  manufacture themselves, and two pieces, each about two yards long, and a yard and
                  a half wide, make a dress: one of them is worn round the middle, and the other
                  covers the upper part of the body: the lower edge of the piece that goes round the
                  middle, the men draw pretty tight just below the fork, the upper edge of it is
                  left loose, so as to form a kind of hollow belt, which serves them as a pocket to
                  carry their knives, and other little implements which it is convenient to have
                  about them. The other piece of cloth is passed through this girdle behind, and one
                  end of it being brought over the left shoulder, and the other over the right, they
                  fall down over the breast, and are tucked into the girdle before, so that by
                  opening or closing the plaits, they can cover more or less of their bodies as they
                  please; the arms, legs, and feet are always naked. The difference between the
                  dress of the two sexes consists principally in the manner of wearing the
                  waist-piece, for the women, instead of drawing the lower edge tight, and leaving
                  the upper edge loose for a pocket, draw the upper edge tight, and let the lower
                  edge fall as low as the knees, so as to form a petticoat; the body-piece, instead
                  of being passed through the girdle, is fastened under the arms, and cross the
                  breast, with the utmost decency. I have already observed, that the men fasten the
                     <pb n="686"/> hair upon the top of the head,* and the women tie it in a club
                  behind, but there is another difference in the headdress, by which the sexes are
                  distinguished: the women wear nothing as a succedaneum for a cap, but the men
                  constantly wrap something round their heads in the manner of a fillet; it is
                  small, but generally of the finest materials that can be procured: we saw some who
                  applied silk handkerchiefs to this purpose, and others that wore fine cotton, or
                  muslin, in the manner of a small turban. </p><p n="1120">These people bore their testimony that the love of finery is a universal
                  passion, for their ornaments were very numerous. Some of the better sort wore
                  chains of gold round their necks, but they were made of plaited wire, and
                  consequently were light and of little value; others had rings, which were so much
                  worn that they seemed to have descended through many generations; and one person
                  had a silver-headed cane, marked with a kind of cypher, consisting of the Roman
                  letters V, O, C, and therefore probably a present from the Dutch East India
                  Company, whose mark it is: they have also ornaments made of beads, which some wear
                  round their necks as a solitaire, and others, as bracelets, upon their wrists:
                  these are common to both sexes, but the women have besides, strings or girdles of
                  beads, which they wear round their waists, and which serve to keep up their
                  petticoat. Both sexes had their ears bored, nor was there a single exception that
                  fell under our notice, yet we never saw an ornament in any of them; we never
                  indeed saw either man or woman in any thing but what appeared to be their ordinary
                  dress, except the King and his minister, who in general wore a kind of night-gown
                  of coarse chintz, and one of whom once received us in a black robe, which appeared
                  to be made of what is called prince's stuff. We saw some boys, about twelve or
                  fourteen years old, who had spiral circles <pb n="687"/> of thick brass wire
                  passed three or four times round their arms, above the elbow,* and some men wore
                  rings of ivory, two inches in breadth, and above an inch in thickness, upon the
                  same part of the arm: these, we were told, were the sons of the Rajas, or Chiefs,
                  who wore these cumbrous ornaments as badges of their high birth. </p><p n="1121">Almost all the men had their names traced upon their arms, in indelible
                  characters of a black colour, and the women had a square ornament of flourished
                  lines, impressed in the same manner, just under the bend of the elbow. We were
                  struck with the similitude between these marks, and those made by tattowing in the
                  South Sea islands, and upon enquiring into its origin, we learnt that it had been
                  practised by the natives long before any Europeans came among them; and that in
                  the neighbouring islands the inhabitants were marked with circles upon their necks
                  and breasts. The universality of this practice, which prevails among savages in
                  all parts of the world, from the remotest limits of North America, to the islands
                  in the South Seas, and which probably differs but little from the method of
                  staining the body that was in use among the ancient inhabitants of Britain, is a
                  curious subject of speculation†. </p><p n="1122">The houses of Savu are all built upon the same plan, and differ only in
                  size, being large in proportion to the rank and <pb n="688"/> riches of the
                  proprietor.* Some are four hundred feet long, and some are not more than twenty:
                  they are all raised upon posts, or piles, about four feet high, one end of which
                  is driven into the ground, and upon the other end is laid a substantial floor of
                  wood, so that there is a vacant space of four feet between the floor of the house
                  and the ground. Upon this floor are placed other posts or pillars, that support a
                  roof of sloping sides, which meet in a ridge at the top, like those of our barns:
                  the eaves of this roof, which is thatched with palm leaves, reach within two feet
                  of the floor, and over-hang it as much: the space within is generally divided
                  lengthwise into three equal parts; the middle part, or center, is inclosed by a
                  partition of four sides, reaching about six feet above the floor, and one or two
                  small rooms are also sometimes taken off from the sides, the rest of the space
                  under the roof is open, so as freely to admit the air and the light: the
                  particular uses of these different apartments, our short stay would not permit us
                  to learn, except that the close room in the center was appropriated to the women. </p><p n="1123">The food of these people consists of every tame animal in the country, of
                  which the hog holds the first place in their estimation, and the horse the second;
                  next to the horse is the buffalo, next to the buffalo their poultry, and they
                  prefer dogs and cats to sheep and goats. They are not fond of fish, and, I
                  believe, it is never eaten but by the poor people, nor by them, except when their
                  duty or business requires them to be upon the beach, and then every man is
                  furnished with a light casting net, which is girt round him, and makes part of his
                  dress; and with this he takes any small fish which happen to come in his way. </p><p n="1124">The aesculent vegetables and fruits have been mentioned already, but the
                  fan-palm requires more particular notice, <pb n="689"/> for at certain times it is
                  a succedaneum for all other food both to man and beast. A kind of wine, called
                  toddy,* is procured from this tree, by cutting the buds which are to produce
                  flowers, soon after their appearance, and tying under them small baskets, made of
                  the leaves, which are so close as to hold liquids without leaking. The juice which
                  trickles into these vessels, is collected by persons who climb the trees for that
                  purpose, morning and evening, and is the common drink of every individual upon the
                  island; yet a much greater quantity is drawn off than is consumed in this use, and
                  of the surplus they make both a syrup and coarse sugar. The liquor is called dua,
                  or duac, and both the syrup and sugar, gula. The syrup is prepared by boiling the
                  liquor down in pots of earthen ware, till it is sufficiently inspissated; it is
                  not unlike treacle in appearance, but is somewhat thicker, and has a much more
                  agreeable taste: the sugar is of a reddish brown, perhaps the same with the Jugata
                  sugar upon the continent of India, and it was more agreeable to our palates than
                  any cane sugar, unrefined, that we had ever tasted. We were at first afraid that
                  the syrup, of which some of our people eat very great quantities, would have
                  brought on fluxes, but its aperient quality was so very slight, that what effect
                  it produced was rather salutary than hurtful. I have already observed, that it is
                  given with the husks of rice to the hogs, and that they grow enormously fat
                  without taking any other food: we were told also, that this syrup is used to
                  fatten their dogs and their fowls, and that the inhabitants themselves have
                  subsisted upon this alone for several months, when other crops have failed, and
                  animal food has been scarce. The leaves of this tree are also put to various uses,
                  they thatch houses, and make baskets, cups, umbrellas, and tobacco-pipes. The
                  fruit is least esteemed, and as the blossoms are wounded for the tuac or toddy,
                  there <pb n="690"/> is not much of it:* it is about as big as a large turnip, and
                  covered, like the cocoa-nut, with a fibrous coat, under which are three kernels,
                  that must be eaten before they are ripe, for afterwards they become so hard that
                  they cannot be chewed; in their eatable state they taste not unlike a green
                  cocoa-nut, and, like them, probably they yield a nutriment that is watry and
                  unsubstantial. </p><p n="1125">The common method of dressing food here is by boiling, and as fire-wood
                  is very scarce, and the inhabitants have no other fuel, they make use of a
                  contrivance to save it, that is not wholly unknown in Europe, but is seldom
                  practised except in camps. They dig a hollow under ground, in a horizontal
                  direction, like a rabbit burrow, about two yards long, and opening into a hole at
                  each end, one of which is large and the other small: by the large hole the fire is
                  put in, and the small one serves for a draught. The earth over this burrow is
                  perforated by circular holes, which communicate with the cavity below; and in
                  these holes are set earthen pots, generally about three to each fire, which are
                  large in the middle, and taper towards the bottom, so that the fire acts upon a
                  large part of their surface. Each of these pots generally contains about eight or
                  ten gallons, and it is surprising to see with how small a quantity of sire they
                  may be kept boiling; a palm leaf, or a dry stalk, thrust in now and then, is
                  sufficient: in this manner they boil all their victuals, and make all their syrup
                  and sugar. It appears by Frazier's account of his voyage to the South Sea, that
                  the Peruvian Indians have a contrivance of the same kind, and perhaps it might be
                  adopted with advantage by the poor people even of this country, where fuel is very
                  dear. </p><p n="1126">Both sexes are enslaved by the hateful and pernicious habit of chewing
                  beetle and areca, which they contract even while <pb n="691"/> they are children,*
                  and practise incessantly from morning till night. With these they always mix a
                  kind of white lime, made of coral stone and shells, and frequently a small
                  quantity of tobacco, so that their mouths are disgustful in the highest degree
                  both to the smell and the fight: the tobacco taints their breath, and the beetle
                  and lime make the teeth not only as black as charcoal, but as rotten too. I have
                  seen men between twenty and thirty, whose fore teeth have been consumed almost
                  down to the gums, though no two of them were exactly of the same length or
                  thickness, but irregularly corroded like iron by rust. This loss of teeth is, I
                  think, by all who have written upon the subject, imputed to the tough and stringy
                  coat of the areca nut; but I impute it wholly to the lime: they are not loosened,
                  or broken, or forced out, as might be expected if they were injured by the
                  continual chewing of hard and rough substances, but they are gradually wasted like
                  metals that are exposed to the action of powerful acids; the stumps always
                  adhering firmly to the socket in the jaw, when there is no part of the tooth above
                  the gums: and possibly those who suppose that sugar has a bad effect upon the
                  teeth of Europeans, may not be mistaken, for it is well known that refined loaf
                  sugar contains a considerable quantity of lime; and he that doubts whether lime
                  will destroy bone of any kind, may easily ascertain the fact by experiment. </p><p n="1127">If the people here are at any time without this odious mouthful, they are
                  smoking. This operation they perform by rolling up a small quantity of tobacco,
                  and putting it into one end of a tube about six inches long, and as thick as a
                  goose quill, which they make of a palm leaf. As the quantity of tobacco in these
                  pipes is very small, the effect of it is increased, especially among the women, by
                  swallowing the smoke. </p><p n="1128"><pb n="692"/>*When the natives of this island were first formed into a civil
                  society, is not certainly known, but at present it is divided into five
                  principalities or nigrees: LAAI, SEBA, REGEEUA, TIMO, and MASSARA, each of which
                  is governed by its respective Raja or King. The Raja of Seba, the principality in
                  which we were ashore, seemed to have great authority, without much external parade
                  or show, or much appearance of personal respect. He was about five and thirty
                  years of age, and the fattest man we saw upon the whole island: he appeared to be
                  of a dull phlegmatic disposition, and to be directed almost implicitly by the old
                  man who, upon my presenting him with a sword, had procured us a fair market, in
                  spight of the craft and avarice of the Dutch factors. The name of this person was
                  MANNU DJARME, and it may reasonably be supposed that he was a man of uncommon
                  integrity and abilities, as, notwithstanding his possession of power in the
                  character of a favourite, he was beloved by the whole principality. If any
                  difference arises among the people, it is settled by the Raja and his counsellors,
                  without delay or appeal, and, as we were told, with the most solemn deliberation
                  and impartial justice. </p><p n="1129">We were informed by Mr. Lange, that the chiefs who had successively
                  presided over the five principalities of this island, had lived for time
                  immemorial in the strictest alliance and most cordial friendship with each other;
                  yet he said the people were of a warlike disposition, and had always courageously
                  defended themselves against foreign invaders. We were told also, that the island
                  was able to raise, upon very short notice, 7300 fighting men, armed with muskets,
                  spears, lances, and targets. Of this force, Laai was said to furnish 2600, Seba
                  2000, Regeeua 1500, Timo 800, and Massārā 400. Besides the arms that have been
                  already mentioned, each man is furnished with a large pole-ax, resembling <pb n="693"/> a wood-bill, except that it has a strait edge,* and is much heavier:
                  this, in the hands of people who have courage to come to close quarters with an
                  enemy, must be a dreadful weapon; and we were told that they were so dexterous
                  with their lances, that at the distance of sixty feet they would throw them with
                  such exactness as to pierce a man's heart, and such force as to go quite through
                  his body. </p><p n="1130">How far this account of the martial prowess of the inhabitants of Savu
                  may be true, we cannot take upon us to determine, but during our stay, we saw no
                  appearance of it. We saw indeed in the town-house, or house of assembly, about one
                  hundred spears and targets, which served to arm the people who were sent down to
                  intimidate us at the trading place; but they seemed to be the refuse of old
                  armories, no two being of the same make or length, for some were six, and some
                  sixteen feet long: we saw no lance among them, and as to the muskets, though they
                  were clean on the outside, they were eaten into holes by the rust within; and the
                  people themselves appeared to be so little acquainted with military discipline,
                  that they marched like a disorderly rabble, every one having, instead of his
                  target, a cock, some tobacco, or other merchandise of the like kind, which he took
                  that opportunity to bring down to sell, and few or none of their cartridge boxes
                  were furnished with either powder or ball, though a piece of paper was thrust into
                  the hole to save appearances. We saw a few swivel guns, and pateraros at the
                  town-house, and a great gun before it; but the swivels and pateraros lay out of
                  their carriages, and the great gun lay upon a heap of stones, almost consumed with
                  rust, with the touch-hole downwards, possibly to conceal its size, which might
                  perhaps be little less than that of the bore. </p><p n="1131"><pb n="694"/>*We could not discover that among these people there was any rank of
                  distinction between the Raja and the land-owners: the land-owners were respectable
                  in proportion to their possessions; the inferior ranks consist of manufacturers,
                  labouring poor, and slaves. The slaves, like the peasants in some parts of Europe,
                  are connected with the estate, and both descend together: but though the
                  land-owner can sell his slave, he has no other power over his person, not even to
                  correct him, without the privity and approbation of the Raja. Some have five
                  hundred of these slaves, and some not half a dozen: the common price of them is a
                  fat hog. When a great man goes out, he is constantly attended by two or more of
                  them: one of them carries a sword or hanger, the hilt of which is commonly of
                  silver, and adorned with large tassels of horse hair; and another carries a bag
                  which contains betel, areca, lime, and tobacco. In these attendants consists all
                  their magnificence, for the Raja himself has no other mark of distinction. </p><p n="1132">The chief object of pride among these people, like that of a Welchman, is
                  a long pedigree of respectable ancestors, and indeed a veneration for antiquity
                  seems to be carried farther here than in any other country: even a house that has
                  been well inhabited for many generations, becomes almost sacred, and few articles
                  either of use or luxury bear so high a price as stones, which having been long sat
                  upon, are become even and smooth: those who can purchase such stones, or are
                  possessed of them by inheritance, place them round their houses, where they serve
                  as seats for their dependants. </p><p n="1133">Every Raja sets up in the principal town of his province, or nigree, a
                  large stone, which serves as a memorial of his reign. In the principal town of
                  Seba, where we lay, there are thirteen such stones, besides many fragments of
                  others, <pb n="695"/> which had been set up in earlier times,* and are now
                  mouldering away: these monuments seem to prove that some kind of civil
                  establishment here is of considerable antiquity. The last thirteen reigns in
                  England make something more than 276 years. </p><p n="1134">Many of these stones are so large, that it is difficult to conceive by
                  what means they were brought to their present station, especially as it is the
                  summit of a hill; but the world is full of memorials of human strength, in which
                  the mechanical powers that have been since added by mathematical science, seem to
                  be surpassed; and of such monuments there are not a few among the remains of
                  barbarous antiquity in our own country, besides those upon Salisbury plain. </p><p n="1135">These stones not only record the reigns of successive princes, but serve
                  for a purpose much more extraordinary, and probably altogether peculiar to this
                  country. When a Raja dies, a general feast is proclaimed throughout his dominions,
                  and all his subjects assemble round these stones; almost every living creature
                  that can be caught is then killed, and the feast lasts for a less or greater
                  number of weeks or months, as the kingdom happens to be more or less furnished
                  with live stock at the time; the stones serve for tables. When this madness is
                  over, a fast must necessarily ensue, and the whole kingdom is obliged to subsist
                  upon syrup and water, if it happens in the dry season, when no vegetables can be
                  procured, till a new stock of animals can be raised from the few that have escaped
                  by chance, or been preserved by policy from the general massacre, or can be
                  procured from the neighbouring kingdoms. Such, however, is the account that we
                  received from Mr. Lange. </p><p n="1136"><pb n="696"/>*We had no opportunity to examine any of their manufactures, except
                  that of their cloth, which they spin, weave, and dye; we did not indeed see them
                  employed, but many of the instruments which they use fell in our way. We saw their
                  machine for clearing cotton of its seeds, which is made upon the same principles
                  as those in Europe, but is so small that it might be taken for a model, or a toy:
                  it consists of two cylinders, like our round rulers, somewhat less than an inch in
                  diameter, one of which, being turned round by a plain winch, turns the other by
                  means of an endless worm; and the whole machine is not more than fourteen inches
                  long, and seven high: that which we saw had been much used, and many pieces of
                  cotton were hanging about it, so that there is no reason to doubt its being a fair
                  specimen of the rest. We also once saw their apparatus for spinning; it consisted
                  of a bobbin, on which was wound a small quantity of thread, and a kind of distaff
                  filled with cotton; we conjectured therefore that they spin by hand, as the women
                  of Europe did before the introduction of wheels; and I am told that they have not
                  yet found their way into some parts of it. Their loom seemed to be in one respect
                  preferable to ours, for the web was not stretched upon a frame, but extended by a
                  piece of wood at each end, round one of which the cloth was rolled, and round the
                  other the threads: the web was about half a yard broad, and the length of the
                  shuttle was equal to the breadth of the web, so that probably their work goes on
                  but slowly. That they dyed this cloth we first guessed from its colour, and from
                  the indigo which we saw in their plantations; and our conjecture was afterwards
                  confirmed by Mr. Lange's account. I have already observed, that it is dyed in the
                  yarn, and we once law them dying what was said to be girdles for the women, of a
                  dirty red, but with what drug we did not think it worth while to enquire. </p><p n="1137"><pb n="697"/>The religion of these people,* according to Mr. Lange's information,
                  is an absurd kind of paganism, every man chusing his own god, and determining for
                  himself how he should be worshipped; so that there are almost as many gods and
                  modes of worship as people. In their morals, however, they are said to be
                  irreproachable, even upon the principles of Christianity: no man is allowed more
                  than one wife; yet an illicit commerce between the sexes is in a manner unknown
                  among them: instances of theft are very rare; and they are so far from revenging a
                  supposed injury by murder, that if any difference arises between them, they will
                  not so much as make it the subject of debate, lest they should be provoked to
                  resentment and ill-will, but immediately and implicity refer it to the
                  determination of their King. </p><p n="1138">They appeared to be a healthy and long-lived people; yet some of them
                  were marked with the small-pox, which Mr. Lange told us had several times made its
                  appearance among them, and was treated with the same precautions as the plague. As
                  soon as a person was seized with the distemper, he was removed to some solitary
                  place, very remote from any habitation, where the disease was left to take its
                  course, and the patient supplied with daily food by reaching it to him at the end
                  of a long pole. </p><p n="1139">Of their domestic oeconomy we could learn but little: in one instance
                  however their delicacy and cleanliness are very remarkable. Many of us were ashore
                  here three successive days, from a very early hour in the morning till it was
                  dark; yet we never saw the least trace of an offering to Cloacina, nor could we so
                  much as guess where they were made. In a country so populous this is very
                  difficult to be accounted <pb n="698"/> for,* and perhaps there is no other
                  country in the world where the secret is so effectually kept. </p><p n="1140">The boats in use here are a kind of proa. </p><p n="1141">This island was settled by the Portuguese almost as soon as they first
                  found their way into this part of the ocean; but they were in a short time
                  supplanted by the Dutch. The Dutch however did not take possession of it, but only
                  sent sloops to trade with the natives, probably for provisions to support the
                  inhabitants of their spice islands, who applying themselves wholly to the
                  cultivation of that important article of trade, and laying out all their ground in
                  plantations, can breed few animals: possibly their supplies by this occasional
                  traffic were precarious; possibly they were jealous of being supplanted in their
                  turn; but however that be, their East India Company, about ten years ago, entered
                  into a treaty with the Rajas, by which the Company stipulated to furnish each of
                  them with a certain quantity of silk, fine linen, cutlery ware, arrack and other
                  articles, every year; and the Rajas engaged that neither they nor their subjects
                  should trade with any person except the company, without having first obtained
                  their consent, and that they would admit a resident on behalf of the Company, to
                  reside upon the island, and see that their part of the treaty was fulfilled: they
                  also engaged to supply annually a certain quantity of rice, maize, and calevances.
                  The maize and calevances are sent to Timor in sloops, which are kept there for
                  that purpose, each of which is navigated by ten Indians; and the rice is fetched
                  away annually by a ship which brings the Company's returns, and anchors
                  alternately in each of the three bays. These returns are delivered to the Rajas in
                  the form of a present, and the cask of arrack they and their principal <pb n="699"/> people never cease to drink,* as long as a drop of it remains. </p><p n="1142">In consequence of this treaty, the Dutch placed three persons upon the
                  island: Mr. Lange, his colleague, the native of Timor, the son of an Indian woman
                  by a Portuguese, and one Frederick Craig, the son of an Indian woman by a
                  Dutchman. Lange visits each of the Rajas once in two months, when he makes the
                  tour of the island, attended by fifty slaves on horseback. He exhorts these Chiefs
                  to plant, if it appears that they have been remiss, and observes where the crops
                  are got in, that he may order sloops to fetch it; so that it passes immediately
                  from the ground to the Dutch storehouses at Timor. In these excursions he always
                  carries with him some bottles of arrack, which he finds of great use in opening
                  the hearts of the Rajas with whom he is to deal. </p><p n="1143">During the ten years that he had resided upon this island he had never
                  seen a European besides ourselves, except at the arrival of the Dutch ship, which
                  had sailed about two months before we arrived; and he is now to be distinguished
                  from the natives only by his colour and his dress, for he sits upon the ground,
                  chews his betele, and in every respect has adopted their character and manners: he
                  has married an Indian woman of the island of Timor, who keeps his house after the
                  fashion of her country; and he gave that as a reason for not inviting us to visit
                  him, saying, that he could entertain us in no other manner than the Indians had
                  done, and he spoke no language readily but that of the country. </p><p n="1144">The office of Mr. Frederic Craig is to instruct the youth of the country
                  in reading and writing, and the principles of the Christian religion; the Dutch
                  having printed versions of the New Testament, a catechism, and several other
                  tracts, <pb n="700"/> in the language of this and the neighbouring islands.* Dr.
                  Solander, who was at his house, saw the books, and the copybooks also, of his
                  scholars, many of whom wrote a very fair hand. He boasted that there were no less
                  than six hundred Christians in the township of Seba; but what the Dutch
                  Christianity of these Indians may be, it is not perhaps very easy to guess, for
                  there is not a church, nor even a priest, in the whole island. </p><p n="1145">While we were at this place, we made several enquiries concerning the
                  neighbouring islands, and the intelligence which we received, is to the following
                  effect: </p><p n="1146">A small island to the westward of Savu, the name of which we did not
                  learn, produces nothing of any consequence but areca-nuts, of which the Dutch
                  receive annually the freight of two sloops, in return for presents that they make
                  to the islanders. </p><p n="1147">Timor is the chief, and the Dutch residents on the other islands go
                  thither once a year to pass their accounts. The place is nearly in the same state
                  as in Dampier's time, the Dutch having there a fort and storehouses; and by
                  Lange's account we might there have been supplied with every necessary that we
                  expected to procure at Batavia, salt provisions and arrack not excepted. But the
                  Portuguese are still in possession of several towns on the north side of the
                  island, particularly Laphao and Sesial. </p><p n="1148">About two years before our arrival, a French ship was wrecked upon the
                  east coast of Timor; and after she had lain some days upon the shoal, a sudden
                  gale broke her up at once, and drowned the Captain, with the greatest part of the
                  crew: those who got ashore, among whom was one of the Lieutenants, made the best
                  of their way to Concordia; they were four days upon the road, where they were
                  obliged <pb n="705"/> to leave part of their company through fatigue,* and the
                  rest, to the number of about eighty, arrived at the town. They were supplied with
                  every necessary, and sent back to the wreck, with proper assistance, for
                  recovering what could be fished up: they fortunately got up all their bullion,
                  which was in chests, and several of their guns, which were very large. They then
                  returned to the town, but their companions who had been left upon the road were
                  missing, having, as it was supposed, been kept among the Indians, either by
                  persuasion or force; for they are very desirous of having Europeans among them, to
                  instruct them in the art of war. After a stay of more than two months at
                  Concordia, their number was diminished nearly one half by sickness, in consequence
                  of the fatigue and hardship which they had suffered by the shipwreck, and the
                  survivors were sent in a small vessel to Europe. </p><p n="1149">Rotte is in much the same situation as Savu; a Dutch factor resides upon
                  it to manage the natives, and look after its produce, which consists, among other
                  articles, of sugar. Formerly it was made only by bruising the canes, and boiling
                  the juice to a syrup, in the same manner as Toddy; but great improvements have
                  lately been made in preparing this valuable commodity. The three little islands
                  called the Solars are also under the influence of the Dutch settlement at
                  Concordia: they are flat and low, but abound with provisions of every kind, and
                  the middlemost is said to have a good harbour for shipping. Ende, another little
                  island to the westward of the Solars, is still in the hands of the Portuguese, who
                  have a good town and harbour on the north east corner of it called Larntuca: they
                  had formerly an harbour on the south side of it, but that, being much inferior to
                  Larntuca, has for some time been altogether neglected. </p><p n="1150"><pb n="702"/>*The inhabitants of each of these little islands speak a language
                  peculiar to themselves, and it is an object of Dutch policy to prevent, as much as
                  possible, their learning the language of each other. If they spoke a common
                  language, they would learn, by a mutual intercourse with each other, to plant such
                  things as would be of more value to themselves than their present produce, though
                  of less advantage to the Dutch; but their languages being different, they can
                  communicate no such knowlege to each other, and the Dutch secure to themselves the
                  benefit of supplying their several necessities upon their own terms, which it is
                  reasonable to suppose are not very moderate. It is probably with a view to this
                  advantage that the Dutch never teach their own language to the natives of these
                  islands, and have been at the expence of translating the Testament and catechisms
                  into the different languages of each; for in proportion as Dutch had become the
                  language of their religion, it would have become the common language of them all. </p><p n="1151">To this account of Savu, I shall only add a small specimen of its
                  language, by which it will appear to have some affinity with that of the South Sea
                  islands, many of the words being exactly the same, and the numbers manifestly
                  derived from the same source. </p><p n="1152">A man, Momonne. A woman, Mobunnee. The head, Catoo. The hair, Row catoo.

                  to examine, the whole is founded merely upon the report of Mr. Lange, upon whose

                        of the Transactions there while the Ship was refitting.</emph></l></head><p n="1153">*IN the morning of Friday the <date>21st of September</date>, 1770, we got under sail,
                  and stood away to the westward, along the north side of the island of Savu, and of
                  the smaller that lies to the westward of it, which at noon bore from us S.S.E.
                  distant two leagues. At four o'clock in the afternoon, we discovered a small low
                  island, bearing S. S. W. distant three leagues, which has no place in any chart
                  now extant, at least in none that I have been able to procure: it lies in latitude
                  <geo select="lat" n="157">10° 47′ S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="157">238° 28′ W</geo>. </p><p n="1154">*At noon on the <date>22d</date>, we were in latitude <geo select="lat" n="158">11° 10′ S</geo>., longitude
                  <geo select="lon" n="158">240° 38′ W</geo>.* In the evening of the <date>23d</date>, we found the variation of
                  the needle to be <geo select="lon">2° 44′ W</geo>.; as soon as we got clear of the islands we
                  had constantly a swell from the southward, which I imagined was not caused by a
                  wind blowing from that quarter, but by the sea being so determined by the position
                  of the coast of New Holland. </p><p n="1155">*At noon on the <date>26th</date>, being in latitude <geo select="lat" n="159">10° 47′ S</geo>., longitude
                  <geo select="lon" n="159">249° 52′ W</geo>. we found the variation to be <geo select="lon">3° 10′ W</geo>. and
                  our situation to be twenty-five miles to the northward of the log; for which I
                  know not how to account. At noon on the <date>27th</date>,* our latitude by observation was
                  <geo select="lat" n="160">10° 51′ S</geo>. which was agreeable to the log; and our longitude was
                  <geo select="lon" n="160">252° 11′ W</geo>. We steered N. W. all day on the <date>28th</date>,* in order to make
                  the <pb n="705"/> land of Java; and at noon on the <date>29th</date>,* our latitude by
                  observation was <geo select="lat" n="161">9° 31′ S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="161">254° 10′ W</geo>.; and in the
                  morning of the <date>30th</date>, I took into my possession the log-book an journals, at least
                  all I could find, of the officers, petty officers, and seamen, and enjoined them
                  secrecy with respect to where they had been. </p><p n="1156">At seven in the evening, being in the latitude of Java Head, and not
                  seeing any land, I concluded that we were too far to the westward: I therefore
                  hauled up E. N. E. having before steered N. by E. In the night, we had thunder and
                  lightning; and about twelve o'clock, by the light of the flashes, we saw the land
                  bearing east. I then tacked and stood to the S. W. till four o'clock in the
                  morning of the <date>1st of October</date>; and at six, Java Head, or the west end of Java,*
                  bore S. E. by E. distant five leagues: soon after we saw Prince's Island, bearing
                  E. ½ S.; and at ten, the island of Cracatoa, bearing N.E. Cracatoa is a remarkably
                  high-peaked island, and at noon it bore N. 40 E. distant seven leagues. </p><p n="1157">I must now observe that, during our run from Savu, I allowed twenty
                  minutes a-day for the westerly current, which I concluded must run strong at this
                  time, especially off the coast of Java, and I found that this allowance was just
                  equivalent to the effect of the current upon the ship. </p><p n="1158">At four o'clock in the morning of the <date>2d</date>,* we fetched close in with the
                  coast of Java, in fifteen fathom; we then stood along the coast, and early in the
                  forenoon, I sent the boat ashore to try if she could procure some fruit for Tupia,
                  who was very ill, and some grass for the buffaloes that were still alive. In an
                  hour or two she returned with four cocoa-nuts, and a small bunch of plantains,
                  which had been purchased for a shilling, and some herbage for the cattle, which
                  the Indians not only gave us, but assisted our people to cut. The <pb n="706"/>
                  country looked like one continued wood,* and had a very pleasant appearance. </p><p n="1159">About eleven o'clock, we saw two Dutch ships lying off Anger point, and I
                  sent Mr. Hicks on board of one of them to enquire news of our country, from which
                  we had been absent so long. In the mean time it fell calm, and about noon I
                  anchored in eighteen fathom with a muddy bottom. When Mr. Hicks returned, he
                  reported that the ships were Dutch East Indiamen from Batavia, one of which was
                  bound to Ceylon, and the other to the coast of Malabar; and that there was also a
                  flyboat or packet, which was said to be stationed here to carry letters from the
                  Dutch ships that came hither to Batavia, but which I rather think was appointed to
                  examine all ships that pass the streight: from these ships we heard, with great
                  pleasure, that the Swallow had been at Batavia about two years before. </p><p n="1160">At seven o'clock a breeze sprung up at S. S. W. with which having
                  weighed, we stood to the N. E. between Thwart-the-way-Island and the Cap, sounding
                  from eighteen to twenty-eight fathom: we had but little wind all night, and having
                  a strong current against us, we got no further by eight in the morning than Bantam
                  Point.* At this time the wind came to the N. E. and obliged us to anchor in two
                  and twenty fathom, at about the distance of two miles from the shore; the point
                  bore N. E. by E. distant one league, and here we found a strong current setting to
                  the N. W. In the morning we had seen the Dutch packet standing after us, but when
                  the wind shifted to the N. E. she bore away. </p><p n="1161">At six o'clock in the evening, the wind having obliged us to continue at
                  anchor, one of the country boats came along side of us, on board of which was the
                  Master of the packet. He seemed to have two motives for his visit, one to take an
                     <pb n="707"/> account of the ship, and the other to sell us refreshments;* for
                  in the boat were turtle, fowls, ducks, parrots, paroquets, rice-birds, monkies,
                  and other articles, which they held at a very high price, and brought to a bad
                  market, for our Savu stock was not yet expended: however, I gave a Spanish dollar
                  for a small turtle, which weighed about six and thirty pounds; I gave also a
                  dollar for ten large fowls, and afterwards bought fifteen more at the same price;
                  for a dollar we might also have bought two monkies, or a whole cage of rice-birds.
                  The Master of the sloop brought with him two books, in one of which he desired
                  that any of our officers would write down the name of the ship and its Commander,
                  with that of the place from which she sailed, and of the port to which she was
                  bound, with such other particulars relating to themselves, as they might think
                  proper, for the information of any of our friends that should come after us: and
                  in the other he entered the names of the ship and the Commander, himself, in order
                  to transmit them to the Governor and Council of the Indies. We perceived that in
                  the first book many ships, particularly Portuguese, had made entries of the same
                  kind with that for which it was presented to us. Mr. Hicks, however, having
                  written the name of the ship, only added "from Europe." He took notice of this,
                  but said, that he was satisfied with any thing we thought fit to write, it being
                  intended merely for the information of those who should enquire after us from
                  motives of friendship. </p><p n="1162">Having made several attempts to sail with a wind that would not stem the
                  current, and as often come to an anchor, a proa came alongside of us in the
                  morning of the <date>5th</date>,* in which was a Dutch officer, who sent me down a printed
                  paper in English, duplicates of which he had in other languages, <pb n="708"/>
                  particularly in French and Dutch,* all regularly signed, in the name of the
                  Governor and Council of the Indies, by their secretary: it contained nine
                  questions, very ill expressed, in the following terms: </p><p n="1163">1. To what nation the ship belongs, and its name? </p><p n="1164">2. If it comes from Europe, or any other place? </p><p n="1165">3. From what place it lastly departed from? </p><p n="1166">4. Whereunto designed to go? </p><p n="1167">5. What and how many ships of the Dutch Company by departure from the
                  last shore there layed, and their names? </p><p n="1168">6. If one or more of these ships in company with this, is departed for
                  this, or any other place? </p><p n="1169">7. If during the voyage any particularities is happened or seen? </p><p n="1170">8. If not any ships in sea, or the Streights of Sunda, have seen or
                  hailed in, and which? </p><p n="1171">9. If any other news worth of attention, at the place from whence the
                  ship lastly departed, or during the voyage, is happened. </p><p n="1172">BATAVIA, in the Castle. </p><p n="1173">By order of the Governor General, and the Counsellors of India, J.
                  BRANDER BUNGL, SEC. </p><p n="1174">Of these questions I answered only the first and the fourth; which when
                  the officer saw, he said answers to the rest were of no consequence: yet he
                  immediately added, that he must send that very paper away to Batavia, and that it
                  would be there the next day at noon. I have particularly related this <pb n="709"/> incident,* because I have been credibly informed that it is but of late years
                  that the Dutch have taken upon them to examine ships that pass through this
                  Streight. </p><p n="1175">At ten o'clock the same morning, we weighed, with a light breeze at S.
                  W.; but did little more than stem the current, and about two o'clock anchored
                  again under Bantam Point, where we lay till nine; a light breeze then springing up
                  at S.E. we weighed and stood to the eastward till ten o'clock the next morning,*
                  when the current obliged us again to anchor in twenty-two fathom, Pulababi bearing
                  E. by S. ½ S. distant between three and four miles. Having alternately weighed and
                  anchored several times, till four in the afternoon of the <date>7th</date>, we then stood to
                  the eastward,* with a very faint breeze at N. E. and passed Wapping Island, and
                  the first island to the eastward of it; when the wind dying away, we were carried
                  by the current between the first and second of the islands that lie to the
                  eastward of Wapping Island, were we were obliged to anchor in thirty fathom, being
                  very near a ledge of rocks that run out from one of the islands. At two the next
                  morning we weighed with the land wind at south,* and stood out clear of the shoal;
                  but before noon were obliged to come to again in twenty-eight fathom, near a small
                  island among those that are called the Thousand Islands, which we did not find
                  laid down in any chart. Pulo Pare at this time bore E. N. E. distance between six
                  and seven miles. </p><p n="1176">Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander went ashore upon the island, which they found
                  not to be more than five hundred yards long, and one hundred broad; yet there was
                  a house upon it, and a small plantation, where among other things was the Palma
                  Christi, from which the castor oil is made in the West Indies: they made a small
                  addition to their collection of plants, and shot a bat, whose wings when extended
                  measured <pb n="710"/> three feet from point to point:* they shot also four
                  plovers, which exactly resembled the golden plover of England. Soon after they
                  returned, a small Indian boat came alongside with two Malays on board, who brought
                  three turtles, some dried fish, and a few pumpkins: we bought the turtle, which
                  altogether weighed a hundred and forty-six pounds, for a dollar, and considering
                  that we had lately paid the Dutchman a dollar for one that weighed only six and
                  thirty pounds, we thought we had a good bargain. The seller appeared equally
                  satisfied, and we then treated with him for his pumpkins, for which he was very
                  unwilling to take any money but a dollar; we laid that a whole dollar was greatly
                  too much; to which he readily assented, but desired that we would cut one and give
                  him a part: at last, however, a fine shining Portuguese petacka tempted him, and
                  for that he sold us his whole stock of pumpkins, being in number twenty-six. At
                  parting, he made signs that we should not tell at Batavia that any boat had been
                  aboard us. </p><p n="1177">We were not able to weather Pulo Pare this day, but getting the land wind
                  at south about ten o'clock at night, we weighed and stood to the E. S. E. all
                  night. At ten in the morning,* we anchored again, to wait for the sea breeze; and
                  at noon it sprung up at N.N.E. with which we stood in for Batavia road, where at
                  four o'clock in the afternoon we came to an anchor. </p><p n="1178">We found here the Harcourt Indiaman from England, two English private
                  traders of that country, thirteen sail of large Dutch ships, and a considerable
                  number of small vessels. A boat came immediately on board, from a ship which had a
                  broad pendant flying, and the officer who commanded having enquired who we were,
                  and whence we came, immediately returned with such answers as we thought fit to
                  give <pb n="711"/> him: both he and his people were as pale as spectres,* a sad
                  presage of our sufferings in so unhealthy a country; but our people, who, except
                  Tupia, were all rosy and plump, seemed to think themselves so seasoned by various
                  climates that nothing could hurt them. In the mean time, I sent a Lieutenant
                  ashore to acquaint the Governor of our arrival, and to make an excuse for our not
                  saluting; for as I could salute with only three guns, except the swivels, which I
                  was of opinion would not be heard, I thought it was better to let it alone. As
                  soon as the boat was dispatched the carpenter delivered me an account of the
                  defects of the ship, of which the following is a copy: </p><p n="1179">The defects of his Majesty's bark Endeavour, Lieutenant James Cook
                  Commander. </p><p n="1180">The ship very leaky, as she makes from twelve to six inches water an
                  hour, occasioned by her main keel being wounded in many places, and the scarfs of
                  her stern being very open: the false keel gone beyond the midships from forward,
                  and perhaps farther, as I had no opportunity of seeing for the water when hauled
                  ashore for repairing: wounded on the larboard side under the main channel, where I
                  imagine the greatest leak is, but could not come at it for the water: one pump on
                  the larboard side useless; the others decayed within an inch and an half of the
                  bore. Otherwise masts, yards, boats, and hull, in pretty good condition. </p><p n="1181">As it was the universal opinion that the ship could not safely proceed to
                  Europe without an examination of her bottom, I determined to apply for leave to
                  heave her down at this place; and as I understood that it would be necessary to
                  make this application in writing, I drew up a request, and <pb n="712"/> the next
                  morning,* having got it translated into Dutch, we all went ashore. </p><p n="1182">We repaired immediately to the house of Mr. Leith, the only Englishman of
                  any credit who is resident at this place; he received us with great politeness,
                  and engaged us to dinner: to this gentleman we applied for instructions how to
                  provide ourselves with lodgings and necessaries while we should stay ashore, and
                  he told us, that there was a hotel, or kind of inn, kept by the order of
                  government, where all merchants and strangers were obliged to reside, paying half
                  per cent upon the value of their goods for warehouse room, which the master of the
                  house was obliged to provide; but that as we came in a King's ship, we should be
                  at liberty to live where we pleased, upon asking the Governor's permission, which
                  would be granted of course. He said, that it would be cheaper for us to take a
                  house in the town, and bring our own servants ashore, if we had any body upon whom
                  we could depend to buy in our provisions; but as this was not the case, having no
                  person among us who could speak the Malay language, our gentlemen determined to go
                  to the hotel. At the hotel, therefore, beds were immediately hired, and word was
                  sent that we should sleep there at night. </p><p n="1183">At five o'clock in the afternoon, I was introduced to the
                  Governor-General, who received me very courteously; he told me, that I should have
                  every thing I wanted, and that in the morning my request should be laid before the
                  council, which I was desired to attend. </p><p n="1184">About nine o'clock, we had a dreadful storm of thunder, lightning, and
                  rain, during which the main-mast of one of the Dutch East Indiamen was split, and
                  carried away by the deck; the main-top-mast and top-gallant-mast were shivered <pb n="713"/> all to pieces;* she had an iron spindle at the
                  main-top-gallant-mast-head, which probably directed the stroke. This ship lay not
                  more than the distance of two cables' length from ours, and in all probability we
                  should have shared the same fate, but for the electrical chain which we had but
                  just got up, and which conducted the lightning over the side of the ship; but
                  though we escaped the lightning, the explosion shook us like an earthquake, the
                  chain at the same time appearing like a line of fire: a centinel was in the action
                  of charging his piece, and the shock forced the musket out of his hand, and broke
                  the rammer rod. Upon this occasion, I cannot but earnestly recommend chains of the
                  same kind to every ship, whatever be her destination, and I hope that the fate of
                  the Dutchman will be a warning to all who shall read this narrative, against
                  having an iron spindle at the mast-head. </p><p n="1185">The next morning, I attended at the council-chamber,* and was told that I
                  should have every thing I wanted. In the mean time, the gentlemen ashore agreed
                  with the keeper of the hotel for their lodging and board, at the rate of two
                  rix-dollars, or nine shillings sterling a day for each; and as there were five of
                  them, and they would probably have many visitors from the ship, he agreed to keep
                  them a separate table, upon condition that they should pay one rix-dollar for the
                  dinner of every stranger, and another for his supper and bed, if he should sleep
                  ashore. Under this stipulation they were to be furnished with tea, coffee, punch,
                  pipes and tobacco, for themselves and their friends, as much as they could
                  consume; they were also to pay half a rupee, or one shilling and three pence a day
                  for each of their servants. </p><p n="1186">They soon learnt that these rates were more than double the common
                  charges of board and lodging in the town, and <pb n="714"/> their table,* though
                  it had the appearance of magnificence, was wretchedly served. Their dinner
                  consisted of one course of fifteen dishes, and their supper of one course of
                  thirteen, but nine or ten of them consisted of bad poultry, variously dressed, and
                  often served up the second, third, and even the fourth time: the same duck having
                  appeared more than once roasted, found his way again to the table as a fricasee,
                  and a fourth time in the form of forced meat. It was not long, however, before
                  they learnt that this treatment was only by way of essay, and that it was the
                  invariable custom of the house, to supply all strangers, at their first coming,
                  with such fare as could be procured for the least money, and consequently would
                  produce the most gain: that if either through indolence or good-nature they were
                  content, it was continued for the benefit of the host, but that if they
                  complained, it was gradually amended till they were satisfied, which sometimes
                  happened before they had the worth of their money. After this discovery, they
                  remonstrated, and their fare became better; however, after a few days, Mr. Banks
                  hired a little house, the next door on the left hand to the hotel, for himself and
                  his party, for which he paid after the rate of ten rix-dollars, or two pounds five
                  shillings sterling a month; but here they were very far from having either the
                  convenience or the privacy which they expected; no person was permitted to sleep
                  in this private house occasionally, as a guest to the person who hired it, under a
                  penalty, but •amost every Dutchman that went by ran in without any ceremony, to
                  ask what they sold, there having been very seldom any private persons at Batavia
                  who had not something to sell. Every body here hires a carriage, and Mr. Banks
                  hired two. They are open chaises, made to hold two people, and driven by a man
                  sitting on a coach-box; for each of these he paid two rix-dollars a day. </p><p n="1187"><pb n="715"/>As soon as he was settled in his new habitation,* he sent for Tupia,
                  who till now had continued on board upon account of his illness, which was of the
                  bilious kind, and for which he had obstinately refused to take any medicine. He
                  soon came ashore, with his boy Tayeto, and though while he was on board, and after
                  he came into the boat, he was exceedingly listless and dejected, he no sooner
                  entered the town than he seemed to be animated with a new soul. The houses,
                  carriages, streets, people, and a multiplicity of other objects, all new, which
                  rushed upon him at once, produced an effect like the sudden and secret power that
                  is imagined of fascination. Tayeto expressed his wonder and delight with still
                  less restraint, and danced along the street in a kind of extasy, examining every
                  object with a restless and eager curiosity, which was every moment excited and
                  gratified. One of the first things that Tupia remarked, was the various dresses of
                  the passing multitude, concerning which he made many enquiries; and when he was
                  told that in this place, where people of many different nations were assembled,
                  every one wore the habit of his country, he desired that he might conform to the
                  custom, and appear in that of Otaheite. South Sea cloth was therefore sent for
                  from the ship, and he equipped himself with great expedition and dexterity. The
                  people who had seen Otourou, the Indian who had been brought hither by M.
                  Bougainville, enquired whether Tupia was not the same person: from these
                  enquiries, we learnt who it was that we had supposed to be Spaniards, from the
                  accounts that had been given of two ships by the Islanders. </p><p n="1188">In the mean time, I procured an order to the superintendant of the island
                  of Ourust, where the ship was to be repaired, to receive her there; and sent by
                  one of the ships that sailed for Holland, an account of our arrival here, to Mr.
                  Stephens, the Secretary to the Admiralty. </p><p n="1189"><pb n="716"/>*The expences that would be incurred by repairing and refitting the
                  ship, rendered it necessary for me to take up money in this place, which I
                  imagined might be done without difficulty, but I found myself mistaken; for after
                  the most diligent enquiry, I could not find any private person that had ability
                  and inclination to advance the sum that I wanted. In this difficulty I applied to
                  the Governor himself, by a written request, in consequence of which, the Shebander
                  had orders to supply me with what money I should require out of the Company's
                  Treasury. </p><p n="1190">*On the <date>18th</date>, as soon as it was light, having by several accidents and
                  mistakes suffered a delay of many days, I took up the anchor, and ran down to
                  Ourust: a few days afterwards, we went along-side of the wharf, on Cooper's
                  Island, which lies close to Ourust, in order to take out our stores. </p><p n="1191">By this time, having been here only nine days, we began to feel the fatal
                  effects of the climate and situation. Tupia, after the flow of spirits which the
                  novelties of the place produced upon his first landing, sunk on a sudden, and grew
                  every day worse and worse. Tayeto was seized with an inflammation upon his lungs,
                  Mr. Banks's two servants became very ill, and himself and Dr. Solander were
                  attacked by fevers: in a few days, almost every person both on board and ashore
                  was sick; affected, no doubt, by the low swampy situation of the place, and the
                  numberless dirty canals which intersect the town in all directions. On the <date>26th</date>, I
                  set up the tent for the reception of the ship's company, of whom there was but a
                  small number able to do duty. Poor Tupia, of whose life we now began to despair,
                  and who till this time had continued ashore with Mr. Banks, desired to be removed
                  to the ship, where, he said, he should breathe a freer air than among the numerous
                  houses which obstructed it <pb n="717"/> ashore: on board the ship, however, he
                  could not go,* for she was unrigged, and preparing to be laid down at the
                  careening place; but on the <date>28th</date>,* Mr. Banks went with him to Cooper's Island, or,
                  as it is called here, Kuypor, where she lay, and as he seemed pleased with the
                  spot, a tent was there pitched for him: at this place, both the sea breeze and the
                  land breeze blew directly over him, and he expressed great satisfaction in his
                  situation. Mr. Banks, whose humanity kept him two days with this poor Indian,
                  returned to the town on the <date>30th</date>, and the fits of his intermittent,* which was now
                  become a regular tertian, were so violent as to deprive him of his senses while
                  they lasted, and leave him so weak that he was scarcely able to crawl down stairs:
                  at this time, Dr. Solander's disorder also increased, and Mr. Monkhouse, the
                  Surgeon, was confined to his bed. </p><p n="1192">On the fifth of November,* after many delays in consequence of the Dutch
                  ships coming along-side the wharfs to load pepper, the ship was laid down, and the
                  same day, Mr. Monkhouse, our Surgeon, a sensible, skilful man, fell the first
                  sacrifice to this fatal country, a loss which was greatly aggravated by our
                  situation. Dr. Solander was just able to attend his funeral, but Mr. Banks was
                  confined to his bed. Our distress was now very great, and the prospect before us
                  discouraging in the highest degree: our danger was not such as we could surmount
                  by any efforts of our own; courage, skill, and diligence were all equally
                  ineffectual, and death was every day making advances upon us, where we could
                  neither resist nor fly. Malay servants were hired to attend the sick, but they had
                  so little sense either of duty or humanity, that they could not be kept within
                  call, and the patient was frequently obliged to get out of bed to seek them. On
                  the <date>9th</date>, we lost our poor Indian boy Tayeto,* and Tupia was <pb n="718"/> so much
                  affected,* that it was doubted whether he would survive till the next day. </p><p n="1193">In the mean time, the bottom of the ship being examined, was found to be
                  in a worse condition than we apprehended: the false keel was all gone to within
                  twenty feet of the stern post; the main keel was considerably injured in many
                  places; a great quantity of the sheathing was torn off, and several planks were
                  much damaged; two of them, and the half of a third, under the main channel near
                  the keel, were, for the length of six feet, so worn, that they were not above an
                  eighth part of an inch thick, and here the worms had made their way quite into the
                  timbers; yet in this condition she had sailed many hundred leagues, where
                  navigation is as dangerous as in any part of the world: how much misery did we
                  escape, by being ignorant that so considerable a part of the bottom of the vessel
                  was thinner than the sole of a shoe, and that every life on board depended upon so
                  slight and fragile a barrier between us and the unfathomable ocean! It seemed,
                  however, that we had been preserved only to perish here; Mr. Banks and Dr.
                  Solander were so bad that the physician declared they had no chance for recovery
                  but by removing into the country; a house was therefore hired for them, at the
                  distance of about two miles from the town, which belonged to the master of the
                  hotel, who engaged to furnish them with provisions, and the use of slaves. As they
                  had already experienced their want of influence over slaves that had other
                  masters, and the unfeeling inattention of these fellows to the sick, they bought
                  each of them a Mallay woman, which removed both the causes of their being so ill
                  served; the women were their own property, and the tenderness of the sex, even
                  here, made them good nurses. While these preparations were making, they received
                  an <pb n="719"/> account of the death of Tupia,* who sunk at once after the loss
                  of the boy, whom he loved with the tenderness of a parent. </p><p n="1194">By the <date>14th</date>,* the bottom of the ship was thoroughly repaired, and very
                  much to my satisfaction: it would, indeed, be injustice to the officers and
                  workmen of this yard, not to declare that, in my opinion, there is not a marine
                  yard in the world, where a ship can be laid down with more convenience, safety,
                  and dispatch, nor repaired with more diligence and skill. At this place they heave
                  down by two masts, a method which we do not now practise; it is, however,
                  unquestionably more safe and expeditious to heave down with two masts than one,
                  and he must have a good share of bigotry to old customs, and an equal want of
                  common sense, who will not allow this, after seeing with what facility the Dutch
                  heave down their largest ships at this place. </p><p n="1195">Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander recovered slowly at their country-house, which
                  was not only open to the sea breeze, but situated upon a running stream, which
                  greatly contributed to the circulation of the air: but I was now taken ill myself;
                  Mr. Sporing, and a seaman who had attended Mr. Banks, were also seized with
                  intermittents; and indeed there was not more than ten of the whole ship's company
                  that were able to do duty. </p><p n="1196">We proceeded however in rigging the ship, and getting water and stores
                  aboard: the water we were obliged to procure from Batavia, at the rate of six
                  shillings and eight pence a leager, or one hundred and fifty gallons. </p><p n="1197">About the <date>26th</date>, the westerly monsoon set in,* which generally blows here
                  in the night from the S. W. and in the day from the N. W. or N. For some nights
                  before this, we had very heavy rain, with much thunder; and in the night between
                     <pb n="720"/> the <date>25th</date> and <date>26th</date>,* such rain as we had seldom seen, for near
                  four hours without intermission. Mr. Banks's house admitted the water in every
                  part like a sieve, and it ran through the lower rooms in a stream that would have
                  turned a mill: he was by this time sufficiently recovered to go out, and upon his
                  entering Batavia the next morning, he was much surprised to see the bedding every
                  where hung out to dry. </p><p n="1198">The wet season was now set in, though we had some intervals of fair
                  weather. The frogs in the ditches, which croak ten times louder than any frogs in
                  Europe, gave notice of rain by an incessant noise that was almost intolerable, and
                  the gnats and musquitos, which had been very troublesome even during the dry
                  weather, were now become innumerable, swarming from every plash of water like bees
                  from a hive; they did not, however, much incommode us in the clay, and the stings,
                  however troublesome at first, never continued to itch above half an hour, so that
                  none of us felt in the day, the effects of the wounds they had received in the
                  night. </p><p n="1199">*On the <date>8th of December</date>, the ship being perfectly refitted, and having
                  taken in most of her water and stores, and received her sick on board, we ran up
                  to Batavia Road, and anchored in four fathom and an half of water. </p><p n="1200">*From this time, to the <date>24th</date>, we were employed in getting on board the
                  remainder of our water and provisions, with some new pumps, and in several other
                  operations that were necessary to fit the ship for the sea, all which would have
                  been effected much sooner, if sickness and death had not disabled or carried off a
                  great number of our men. </p><p n="1201">While we lay here, the Earl of Elgin, Captain Cook, a ship belonging to
                  the English East India Company, came to an <pb n="721"/> anchor in the Road. She
                  was bound from Madrass to China,* but having lost her passage, put in here to wait
                  for the next season. The Phoenix, Captain Black, an English country ship, from
                  Bencoolen, also came to an anchor at this place. </p><p n="1202">In the afternoon of Christmas eve, the <date>24th</date>, I took leave of the
                  Governor, and several of the principal gentlemen of the place, with whom I had
                  formed connections, and from whom I received every possible civility and
                  assistance; but in the mean time an accident happened, which might have produced
                  disagreeable consequences. A seaman had run away from one of the Dutch ships in
                  the Road, and entered on board of mine: the Captain had applied to the Governor,
                  to reclaim him as a subject of Holland, and an order for that purpose was
                  procured: this order was brought to me soon after I returned from my last visit,
                  and I said, that if the man appeared to be a Dutchman, he should certainly be
                  delivered up. Mr. Hicks commanded on board, and I gave the Dutch officer an order
                  to him, to deliver the man up under that condition. I slept myself this night on
                  shore, and in the morning,* the Captain of the Dutch Commodore came and told me
                  that he had carried my order on board, but that the officer had refused to deliver
                  up the man, alleging, not only that he was not a Dutchman, but that he was a
                  subject of Great Britain, born in Ireland; I replied, that the officer had
                  perfectly executed my orders, and that if the man was an English subject, it could
                  not be expected that I should deliver him up. The Captain then said, that he was
                  just come from the Governor, to demand the man of me in his name, as a subject of
                  Denmark, alleging, that he stood in the ship's books as born at Elsineur. The
                  claim of this man as a subject of Holland, being now given up, I observed to the
                  Captain, that there appeared to be some <pb n="722"/> mistake in the General's
                  message,* for that he would certainly never demand a Danish seaman from me, who
                  had committed no other crime than preferring the service of the English to that of
                  the Dutch. I added, however, to convince him of my sincere desire to avoid
                  disputes, that if the man was a Dane he should be delivered up as a courtesy,
                  though he could not be demanded as a right; but that if I found he was an English
                  subject, I would keep him at all events. Upon these terms we parted, and soon
                  after I received a letter from Mr. Hicks, containing indubitable proof that the
                  seaman in question was a subject of his Britannic Majesty. This letter I
                  immediately carried to the Shebander, with a request that it might be shewn to the
                  Governor, and that his Excellency might at the same time be told, I would not upon
                  any terms part with the man. This had the desired effect, and I heard no more of
                  the affair. </p><p n="1203">In the evening, I went on board, accompanied by Mr. Banks, and the rest
                  of the gentlemen who had constantly resided on shore, and who, though better, were
                  not yet perfectly recovered. </p><p n="1204">*At six in the morning, of the <date>26th</date>, we weighed and set sail, with a
                  light breeze at S. W. The Elgin Indiaman saluted us with three cheers and thirteen
                  guns, and the garrison with fourteen, both which, with the help of our swivels, we
                  returned, and soon after the sea breeze set in at N. by W. which obliged us to
                  anchor just without the ships in the Road. </p><p n="1205">At this time, the number of sick on board amounted to forty, and the rest
                  of the ship's company were in a very feeble condition. Every individual had been
                  sick except the sail-maker, an old man between seventy and eighty years of <pb n="723"/> age, and it is very remarkable that this old man,* during our stay at
                  this place, was constantly drunk every day: we had buried seven, the Surgeon,
                  three seamen, Mr. Green's servant, Tupia, and Tayeto his boy. All but Tupia fell a
                  sacrifice to the unwholesome, stagnant, putrid air of the country, and he who from
                  his birth had been used to subsist chiefly upon vegetable food, particularly ripe
                  fruit, soon contracted all the disorders that are incident to a sea life, and
                  would probably have sunk under them before we could have completed our voyage, if
                  we had not been obliged to go to Batavia to refit. </p></div><pb n="724"/><div type="chapter" n="41"><head><l>CHAP.XIII.</l><l><emph rend="italic"> Some Account of Batavia, and the adjacent Country; with

                  supposed to have no equal among all the possessions of the Europeans in Asia, is
                  situated on the north side of the island of Java, in a low fenny plain, where
                  several small rivers, which take their rise in the mountains called Blaeuwen Berg,
                  about forty miles up the country, empty themselves into the sea, and where the
                  coast forms a large bay, called the Bay of Batavia, at the distance of about eight
                  leagues from the streight of Sunda. It lies in latitude <geo select="lat" n="162">6° 10′ S</geo>. and
                  longitude <geo select="lon" n="162">106° 50′ E</geo>. from the meridian of Greenwich, as appears from
                  astronomical observations made upon the spot, by the Reverend Mr. Mohr, who has
                  built an elegant observatory, which is as well furnished with instruments as most
                  in Europe. </p><p n="1207">The Dutch seem to have pitched upon this spot for the convenience of
                  water-carriage, and in that it is indeed a second Holland, and superior to every
                  other place in the world. There are very few streets that have not a canal of
                  considerable breadth running through them, or rather stagnating in them, and
                  continued for several miles in almost every direction beyond the town, which is
                  also intersected by five or six rivers, some of which are navigable thirty or
                  forty miles up the country. As the houses are large, and the streets wide, it
                  takes up a much greater extent, in proportion <pb n="725"/> to the number of
                  houses it contains,* than any city in Europe. Valentyn, who wrote an account of it
                  about the year 1726, says, that in his time there were, within the walls, 1242
                  Dutch houses, and 1200 Chinese; and without the walls 1066 Dutch, and 1240
                  Chinese, besides 12 arrack houses, making in all 4760: but this account appeared
                  to us to be greatly exaggerated, especially with respect to the number of houses
                  within the walls. </p><p n="1208">The streets are spacious and handsome, and the banks of the canals are
                  planted with rows of trees, that make a very pleasing appearance; but the trees
                  concur with the canals to make the situation unwholesome. The stagnant canals in
                  the dry season exhale an intolerable stench, and the trees impede the course of
                  the air, by which in some degree the putrid effluvia would be dissipated. In the
                  wet season the inconvenience is equal, for then these reservoirs of corrupted
                  water overflow their banks in the lower part of the town, especially in the
                  neighbourhood of the hotel, and fill the lower stories of the houses, where they
                  leave behind them an inconceivable quantity of slime and filth: yet these canals
                  are sometimes cleaned; but the cleaning them is so managed as to become as great a
                  nuisance as the foulness of the water; for the black mud that is taken from the
                  bottom is suffered to lie upon the banks, that is, in the middle of the street,
                  till it has acquired a sufficient degree of hardness to be made the lading of a
                  boat, and carried away. As this mud consists chiefly of human ordure, which is
                  regularly thrown into the canals every morning, there not being a necessary-house
                  in the whole town, it poisons the air while it is drying to a considerable extent.
                  Even the running streams become nuisances in their turn, by the nastiness or
                  negligence of the people; for every now and then a dead <pb n="726"/> hog,* or a
                  dead horse, is stranded upon the shallow parts, and it being the business of no
                  particular person to remove the nuisance, it is negligently left to time and
                  accident. While we were here, a dead buffalo lay upon the shoal of a river that
                  ran through one of the principal streets above a week, and at last was carried
                  away by a flood. </p><p n="1209">The houses are in general well adapted to the climate; they consist of
                  one very large room or hall on the ground floor, with a door at each end, both
                  which generally stand open: at one end a room is taken off by a partition, where
                  the master of the house transacts his business; and in the middle between each end
                  there is a court, which gives light to the hall, and at the same time increases
                  the draught of air. From one corner of the hall the stairs go up to the floor
                  above, where also the rooms are spacious and airy. In the alcove, which is formed
                  by the court, the family dine; and at other times it is occupied by the female
                  slaves, who are not allowed to sit down any where else. </p><p n="1210">The public buildings are, most of them, old, heavy, and ungraceful; but
                  the new church is not inelegant; it is built with a dome, that is seen from a
                  great distance at sea, and though the outside has rather a heavy appearance, the
                  inside forms a very fine room: it is furnished with an organ of a proper size,
                  being very large, and is most magnificently illuminated by chandeliers. </p><p n="1211">The town is inclosed by a stone wall, of a moderate height; but the whole
                  of it is old, and many parts are much out of repair. This wall itself is
                  surrounded by a river, which in some places is fifty, and in some a hundred yards
                  wide: the stream is rapid, but the water is shallow. The wall is also lined within
                  by a canal, which in different parts is of different breadths; so that, in passing
                  either out or in through the <pb n="727"/> gates, it is necessary to cross two
                  draw-bridges;* and there is no access for idle people or strangers to walk upon
                  the ramparts, which seem to be but ill provided with guns. </p><p n="1212">In the north east corner of the town stands the castle or citadel, the
                  walls of which are both higher and thicker than those of the town, especially near
                  the landing-place, where there is depth of water only for boats, which it
                  completely commands, with several large guns that make a very good appearance. </p><p n="1213">Within this castle are apartments for the Governor General, and all the
                  Council of India, to which they are enjoined to repair in case of a siege. Here
                  are also large storehouses, where great quantities of the Company's goods are
                  kept, especially those that are brought from Europe, and where almost all their
                  writers transact their business. In this place also are laid up a great number of
                  cannon, whether to mount upon the walls or furnish shipping, we could not learn;
                  and the Company is said to be well supplied with powder, which is dispersed in
                  various magazines, that if some should be destroyed by lightning, which in this
                  place is very frequent, the rest may escape. </p><p n="1214">Besides the fortifications of the town, numerous forts are dispersed
                  about the country to the distance of twenty or thirty miles; these seem to have
                  been intended merely to keep the natives in awe, and indeed they are fit for
                  nothing else. For the same purpose a kind of houses, each of which mounts about
                  eight guns, are placed in such situations as command the navigation of three or
                  four canals, and consequently the roads upon their banks: some of these are in the
                  town itself, and it was from one of these that all the best houses belonging to
                  the Chinese were levelled with the ground in the Chinese rebellion of 1740. These
                  defences are scattered over all <pb n="728"/> parts of Java,* and the other
                  islands of which the Dutch have got possession in these seas. Of one of these
                  singular forts, or fortified houses, we should have procured a drawing, if our
                  Gentlemen had not been confined by sickness almost all the time they were upon the
                  island. </p><p n="1215">If the Dutch fortifications here are not formidable in themselves, they
                  become so by their situation; for they are among morasses where the roads, which
                  are nothing more than a bank thrown up between a canal and a ditch, may easily be
                  destroyed, and consequently the approach of heavy artillery either totally
                  prevented or greatly retarded: for it would be exceedingly difficult, if not
                  impossible, to transport them in boats, as they all muster every night under the
                  guns of the castle, a situation from which it would be impossible for an enemy to
                  take them. Besides, in this country, delay is death; so that whatever retards an
                  enemy, will destroy him. In less than a week, we were sensible of the
                  unhealthiness of the climate; and in less than a month half the ship's company
                  were unable to do their duty. We were told, that of a hundred soldiers who arrive
                  here from Europe, it was a rare thing for fifty to survive the first year; that of
                  those fifty, half would then be in the hospital, and not ten of the rest in
                  perfect health: possibly this account may be exaggerated; but the pale and feeble
                  wretches whom we saw crawling about with a musquet, which they were scarcely able
                  to carry, inclined us to believe that it was true. Every white inhabitant of the
                  town indeed is a soldier; the younger are constantly mustered, and those who have
                  served five years are liable to be called out when their assistance is thought to
                  be necessary; but as neither of them are ever exercised, or do any kind of duty,
                  much cannot be expected from them. The Portuguese, indeed, are in general <pb n="729"/> good marksmen,* because they employ themselves much in shooting wild
                  hogs and deer: neither the Mardykers nor the Chinese know the use of fire-arms;
                  but as they are said to be brave, they might do much execution with their own
                  weapons, swords, lances, and daggers. The Mardykers are Indians of all nations,
                  who are descended from free ancestors, or have themselves been made free. </p><p n="1216">But if it is difficult to attack Batavia by land, it is utterly
                  impossible to attack it by sea: for the water is so shallow, that it will scarcely
                  admit a longboat to come within cannon shot of the walls, except in a narrow
                  channel, called the river, that is walled on both sides by strong piers, and runs
                  about half a mile into the harbour. At the other end, it terminates under the fire
                  of the strongest part of the castle; and here its communication with the canals
                  that intersect the town is cut off by a large wooden boom, which is shut every
                  night at six o'clock, and upon no pretence opened till the next morning. The
                  harbour of Batavia is accounted the finest in India, and to all appearance with
                  good reason; it is large enough to contain any number of ships, and the ground is
                  so good that one anchor will hold till the cable decays: it never admits any sea
                  that is troublesome, and its only inconvenience is the shoal water between the
                  road and the river. When the sea breeze blows fresh, it makes a cockling sea that
                  is dangerous to boats: our longboat once struck two or three times as she was
                  attempting to come out, and regained the river's mouth with some difficulty. A
                  Dutch boat, laden with sails and rigging for one of the Indiamen, was entirely
                  lost. </p><p n="1217">Round the harbour, on the outside, lie many islands, which the Dutch have
                  taken possession of, and apply to different uses. To one of them, called Edam,
                  they transport all Europeans <pb n="730"/> who have been guilty of crimes that are
                  not worthy of death:* some are sentenced to remain there ninety-nine years, some
                  forty, some twenty, some less, down to five, in proportion to their offence; and
                  during their banishment, they are employed as slaves in making ropes, and other
                  drudgery. In another island, called Purmerent, they have an hospital, where people
                  are said to recover much faster than at Batavia. In a third, called Kuyper, they
                  have warehouses belonging to the Company, chiefly for rice, and other merchandize
                  of small value; and here the foreign ships, that are to be laid down at Ourust,
                  another of these islands, which with Kuyper has been mentioned before, discharge
                  their cargoes at wharfs which are very convenient for the purpose. Here the guns,
                  sails, and other stores of the Falmouth, a man of war, which was condemned at this
                  place when she was returning from Manilla, were deposited, and the ship herself
                  remained in the harbour with only the warrant officers on board for many years.
                  Remittances were regularly made them from home; but no notice was ever taken of
                  the many memorials they sent, desiring to be recalled. Happily for them, the Dutch
                  thought fit, about six months before our arrival, to sell the vessel and all her
                  stores, by public auction, and send the officers home in their own ships. At
                  Ourust, they repair all their own shipping, and keep a large quantity of naval
                  stores. </p><p n="1218">The country round Batavia is for some miles a continued range of country
                  houses and gardens. Many of the gardens are very large, and, by some strange
                  fatality, all are planted with trees almost as thick as they can stand; so that
                  the country derives no advantage from its being cleared of the wood that
                  originally covered it, except the fruit of that which has been planted in its
                  room. These impenetrable <pb n="731"/> forests stand in a dead flat,* which
                  extends some miles beyond them, and is intersected in many directions by rivers,
                  and more still by canals, which are navigable for small vessels. Nor is this the
                  worst, for the fence of every field and garden is a ditch; and interspersed among
                  the cultivated ground there are many filthy fens, bogs, and morasses, as well
                  fresh as salt. </p><p n="1219">It is not strange that the inhabitants of such a country should be
                  familiar with disease and death: preventive medicines are taken almost as
                  regularly as food; and every body expects the returns of sickness, as we do the
                  seasons of the year. We did not see a single face in Batavia that indicated
                  perfect health, for there is not the least tint of colour in the cheeks either of
                  man or woman: the women indeed are most delicately fair; but with the appearance
                  of disease there never can be perfect beauty. People talk of death with as much
                  indifference as they do in a camp; and when an acquaintance is said to be dead,
                  the common reply is, "Well, he owed me nothing;" or, </p><p n="1220">I must get my money of his executors. To this description of the environs
                  of Batavia there are but two exceptions. The Governor's country house is situated
                  upon a rising ground; but its ascent is so inconsiderable, that it is known to be
                  above the common level only by the canals being left behind, and the appearance of
                  a few bad hedges: his Excellency, however, who is a native of this place, has,
                  with some trouble and expence, contrived to inclose his own garden with a ditch;
                  such is the influence of habit both upon the taste and the understanding. A famous
                  market also, called Passar Tanabank, is held upon an eminence that rises
                  perpendicularly about thirty feet above the plain; and except these situations,
                  the ground, for an extent <pb n="732"/> of between thirty and forty miles round
                  Batavia,* is exactly parallel to the horizon. At the distance of about forty miles
                  inland there are hills of a considerable height, where, as we were informed, the
                  air is healthy, and comparatively cool. Here the vegetables of Europe flourish in
                  great perfection, particularly strawberries, which can but ill bear heat; and the
                  inhabitants are vigorous and ruddy. Upon these hills some of the principal people
                  have country houses, which they visit once a-year; and one was begun for the
                  Governor, upon the plan of Blenheim, the famous seat of the Duke of Marlborough in
                  Oxfordshire, but it has never been finished. To these hills also people are sent
                  by the physicians, for the recovery of their health, and the effects of the air
                  are said to be almost miraculous: the patient grows well in a short time, but
                  constantly relapses soon after his return to Batavia. </p><p n="1221">But the same situation and circumstances which render Batavia and the
                  country round it unwholesome, render it the best gardener's ground in the world.
                  The soil is fruitful beyond imagination, and the conveniences and luxuries of life
                  that it produces are almost without number. </p><p n="1222">Rice, which is well known to be the corn of these countries, and to serve
                  the inhabitants instead of bread, grows in great plenty: and I must here observe,
                  that in the hilly parts of Java, and in many of the eastern islands, a species of
                  this grain is planted, which in the western parts of India is intirely unknown. It
                  is called by the natives Paddy Gunning, or Mountain rice; this, contrary to the
                  other sort which must be under water three parts in four of the time of its
                  growth, is planted upon the sides of hills where no water but rain can come: it is
                  however planted at the beginning of the rainy season, and reaped in the beginning
                  of the dry. How far this kind of rice might be useful in our West Indian islands,
                  where no <pb n="733"/> bread corn is grown,* it may perhaps be worth while to
                  enquire. </p><p n="1223">Indian corn, or maize, is also produced here; which the inhabitants
                  gather when young, and toast in the ear. Here is also a great variety of kidney
                  beans, and lentiles, which they call Cadjang, and which make a considerable part
                  of the food of the common people; besides millet, yams both wet and dry, sweet
                  potatoes, and European potatoes, which are very good, but not cultivated in great
                  plenty. In the gardens, there are cabbages, lettuces, cucumbers, rhadishes, the
                  white rhadishes of China, which boil almost as well as a turnep; carrots, parsley,
                  celery, pigeon peas, the egg plant, which broiled, and eaten with pepper and salt,
                  is very delicious; a kind of greens resembling spinage; onions, very small, but
                  excellent; and asparagus: besides some European plants of a strong smell,
                  particularly sage, hysop, and rue. Sugar is also produced here in immense
                  quantities: very great crops of the finest and largest canes that can be imagined
                  are produced with very little care, and yield a much larger proportion of sugar
                  than the canes of the West Indies. White sugar is sold here at two pence
                  half-penny a pound; and the molasses makes the arrack, of which, as of rum, it is
                  the chief ingredient; a small quantity of rice, and some cocoa-nut wine, being
                  added, chiefly, I suppose, to give it flavour. A small quantity of indigo is also
                  produced here, not as an article of trade, but merely for home consumption. </p><p n="1224">But the most abundant article of vegetable luxury here, is the fruit; of
                  which there is no less than six and thirty different kinds, and I shall give a
                  very brief account of each. </p><p n="1225">1. The pine apple; Bromelin Ananas. This fruit, which is here called
                  Nanas, grows very large, and in such plenty that they may sometimes be bought at
                  the first hand for a farthing <pb n="734"/> a piece;* and at the common fruit
                  shops we got three of them for two pence half-penny. They are very juicy and well
                  flavoured; but we all agreed that we had eaten as good from a hot-house in
                  England: they are however so luxuriant in their growth that most of them have two
                  or three crowns, and a great number of suckers from the bottom of the fruit; of
                  these Mr. Banks once counted nine, and they are so forward that very often while
                  they still adhered to the parent plant they shot out their fruit, which, by the
                  time the large one became ripe, were of no inconsiderable size. We several times
                  saw three upon one apple, and were told that a plant once produced a cluster of
                  nine, besides the principal: this indeed was considered as so great a curiosity,
                  that it was preserved in sugar, and sent to the Prince of Orange. </p><p n="1226">2. Sweet oranges. These are very good, but while we were here, sold for
                  six pence a piece. </p><p n="1227">3. Pumplemoeses, which in the West Indies are called Shaddocks. These
                  were well flavoured, but not juicy; their want of juice however was an accidental
                  effect of the season. </p><p n="1228">4. Lemons. These were very scarce; but the want of them was amply
                  compensated by the plenty of limes. </p><p n="1229">5. Limes. These were excellent, and to be bought at about twelve pence a
                  hundred. We saw only two or three Seville oranges, which were almost all rind; and
                  there are many sorts, both of oranges and lemons, which I shall not particularly
                  mention, because they are neither esteemed by Europeans nor the natives
                  themselves. </p><p n="1230">6. Mangos. This fruit during our stay was so infested with maggots, which
                  bred in the inside them, that scarcely one in three was eatable; and the best of
                  them were much inferior to those of Brazil; they are generally compared by <pb n="735"/> Europeans to a melting peach, which, indeed,* they resemble in
                  softness and sweetness, but certainly fall much short in flavour. The climate
                  here, we were told, is too hot and damp for them; but there are as many sorts of
                  them as there are of apples in England, and some are much superior to others. One
                  sort, which is called Mangha Cowani, has so strong a smell that a European can
                  scarcely bear one in the room; these, however, the natives are fond of. The three
                  sorts which are generally preferred, are the Mangha Doodool, the Mangha Santock,
                  and the Mangha Gure. </p><p n="1231">7. Bananes. Of these also there are innumerable sorts, but three only are
                  good; the Pissang Mas, the Pissang Radja, and the Pissang Ambou: all these have a
                  pleasant vinous taste, and the rest are useful in different ways; some are fried
                  in batter, and others are boiled and eaten as bread. There is one which deserves
                  the particular notice of the botanist, because, contrary to the nature of its
                  tribe, it is full of seeds, and is therefore called Pissang Batu, or Pissang
                  Bidjie; it has however no excellence to recommend it to the taste, but the Malays
                  use it as a remedy for the flux. </p><p n="1232">8. Grapes. These are not in great perfection, but they are very dear; for
                  we could not buy a moderate bunch for less than a shilling or eighteen pence. </p><p n="1233">9. Tamarinds. These are in great plenty, and very cheap: the people
                  however do not put them up in the manner practised by the West Indians, but cure
                  them with salt, by which means they become a black mass, so disagreeable to the
                  sight and taste, that few Europeans chuse to meddle with them. </p><p n="1234">10. Water melons. These are in great plenty, and very good. </p><p n="1235"><pb n="736"/>*11. Pumpkins. These are beyond comparison the most useful fruit that
                  can be carried to sea; for they will keep without any care several months, and
                  with sugar and lemon-juice, make a pye that can scarcely be distinguished from one
                  made of the best apples; and with pepper and salt, they are a substitute for
                  turneps, not to be despised. </p><p n="1236">12. Papaws. This fruit when it is ripe is full of seeds, and almost
                  without flavour; but if when it is green it is pared, and the core taken out, it
                  is better than the best turnep. </p><p n="1237">13. Guava. This fruit is much commended by the inhabitants of our islands
                  in the West Indies, who probably have a better sort than we met with here, where
                  the smell of them was so disagreeably strong that it made some of us sick; those
                  who tasted them, said, that the flavour was equally rank. </p><p n="1238">14. Sweet sop. The Annona squammosa of Linnaeus. This is also a West
                  Indian fruit; it consists only of a mass of large kernels, from which a small
                  proportion of pulp may be sucked, which is very sweet, but has little flavour. </p><p n="1239">15. Custard apple. The Annona reticulata of Linnaeus. The quality of this
                  fruit is well expressed by its English name, which it acquired in the West Indies;
                  for it is as like a custard, and a good one too, as can be imagined. </p><p n="1240">16. The cashew apple. This is seldom eaten on account of its astringency.
                  The nut that grows upon the top of it is well known in Europe. </p><p n="1241">17. The cocoa-nut. This is also well known in Europe; there are several
                  sorts, but the best of those we found here is called Calappi Edjou, and is easily
                  known by the redness of the flesh between the skin and the shell. </p><p n="1242"><pb n="73718"/>. Mangostan. The Garcinia Mangostana of Linnaeus.* This fruit,
                  which is peculiar to the East Indies, is about the size of the crab apple, and of
                  a deep red-wine colour: on the top of it is the figure of five or six small
                  triangles joined in a circle, and at the bottom several hollow green leaves, which
                  are remains of the blossom. When they are to be eaten, the skin, or rather flesh,
                  must be taken off, under which are found six or seven white kernels, placed in a
                  circular order, and the pulp with which these are inveloped, is the fruit, than
                  which nothing can be more delicious: it is a happy mixture of the tart and the
                  sweet, which is no less wholesome than pleasant; and with the sweet orange, this
                  fruit is allowed in any quantity to those who are afflicted with fevers, either of
                  the putrid or inflammatory kind. </p><p n="1243">19. The jamboo. The Eugenia Mallaccensis of Linnaeus. This fruit is of a
                  deep red colour, and an oval shape; the largest, which are always the best, are
                  not bigger than a small apple; they are pleasant and cooling, though they have not
                  much flavour. </p><p n="1244">20. The jambu-eyer. A species of the Eugenia of Linnaeus. Of this fruit
                  there are two sorts of a similar shape, resembling a bell, but differing in
                  colour; one being red, the other white. They somewhat exceed a large cherry in
                  size, and in taste have neither flavour nor even sweetness, containing nothing but
                  a watry juice, slightly acidulated; yet their coolness recommends them in this hot
                  country. </p><p n="1245">21. Jambu-eyer mauwar. The Eugenia jambos of Linnaeus. This is more
                  grateful to the smell than the taste; in taste it resembles the conserve of roses,
                  and in smell the fresh scent of those flowers. </p><p n="1246">22. The pomgranate. This is the same fruit that is known by the same name
                  all over Europe. </p><p n="1247"><pb n="738"/>*23. Durion. A fruit that in shape resembles a small melon, but the
                  skin is covered with sharp conical spines, whence its name; for dure, in the Malay
                  language, signifies prickle. When it is ripe, it divides longitudinally into seven
                  or eight compartments, each of which contains six or seven nuts, not quite so
                  large as chesnuts, which are covered with a substance that in colour and
                  consistence very much resembles thick cream: this is the part that is eaten, and
                  the natives are fond of it to excess. To Europeans it is generally disagreeable at
                  first; for in taste, it somewhat resembles a mixture of cream, sugar, and onions;
                  and in the smell, the onions predominate. </p><p n="1248">24. Nanca. This fruit, which in some parts of India is called Jack, has,
                  like the Durion, a smell very disagreeable to strangers, and somewhat resembling
                  that of mellow apples mixed with garlic: the flavour is not more adapted to the
                  general taste. In some countries that are favourable to it, it is said to grow to
                  an immense size. Rumphius relates, that it is sometimes so large that a man cannot
                  easily lift it; and we were told by a Malay, that at Madura it is sometimes so
                  large as not to be carried but by the united efforts of two men. At Batavia,
                  however, they never exceed the size of a large melon, which in shape they very
                  much resemble: they are covered with angular prickles, like the shootings of some
                  chrystals, which however are not hard enough to wound those who handle them. </p><p n="1249">25. Champada. This differs from the Nanca in little except size, it not
                  being so big. </p><p n="1250">26. Rambutan. This is a fruit little known to Europeans; in appearance it
                  very much resembles a chesnut with the husk on, and like that, is covered with
                  small points, which are soft and of a deep red colour: under this skin is the <pb n="739"/> fruit, and within the fruit a stone;* the eatable part therefore is
                  small in quantity, but its acid is perhaps more agreeable than any other in the
                  whole vegetable kingdom. </p><p n="1251">27. Jambolan. This in size and appearance is not unlike a damascene; but
                  in taste is still more astringent, and therefore less agreeable. </p><p n="1252">28. The Boa Bidarra; or Rhamnus Jujuba of Linnaeus. This is a round
                  yellow fruit, about the size of a gooseberry; its flavour is like that of an
                  apple, but it has the astringency of a crab. </p><p n="1253">29. Nam nam. The Cynometra Cauliflora of Linnaeus. This fruit in shape
                  somewhat resembles a kidney; it is about three inches long, and the outside is
                  very rough: it is seldom eaten raw, but fried with batter it makes a good fritter. </p><p n="1254">30, 31. The Catappa, or Terminalia Catappa; and the Canare, the Canarium
                  commune of Linnaeus; are both nuts, with kernels somewhat resembling an almond;
                  but the difficulty of breaking the shell is so great, that they are no where
                  publicly sold. Those which we tasted were gathered for curiosity by Mr. Banks,
                  from the tree upon which they grew. </p><p n="1255">32. The Madja; or Limonia of Linnaeus; contains, under a hard brittle
                  shell, a lightly acid pulp, which cannot be eaten without sugar; and with it, is
                  not generally thought pleasant. </p><p n="1256">33. Suntul. The Trichilia of Linnaeus. This is the worst of all the
                  fruits that I shall particularly mention: in size and shape it resembles the
                  Madja; and within a thick skin contains kernels like those of the Mangostan, the
                  taste of which is both acid and astringent, and so disagreeable that we were
                  surprised to see it exposed upon the fruit-stalls. </p><p n="1257"><pb n="740"/>*34, 35, 36. The Blimbing, or Averrhoa Belimbi; the Blimbing Besse,
                  or Averrhoa Carambola; and the Cherrema, or Averrhoa acida of Linnaeus, are three
                  species of one genus; and though they differ in shape, are nearly of the same
                  taste. The Blimbing Besse is the sweetest: the other two are so austerely acid,
                  that they cannot be used without dressing; they make however excellent pickles and
                  sour sauce. </p><p n="1258">37. The Salack; or Calamus Rotang Zalacca of Linnaeus. This is the fruit
                  of a prickly bush; it is about as big as a walnut, and covered with scales, like
                  those of a lizard: below the scales are two or three yellow kernels, in flavour
                  somewhat resembling a strawberry. </p><p n="1259">Besides these, the island of Java, and particularly the country round
                  Batavia, produces many kinds of fruit which were not in season during our stay; we
                  were also told that apples, strawberries, and many other fruits from Europe, had
                  been planted up in the mountains, and flourished there in great luxuriance. We saw
                  several fruits preserved in sugar, that we did not see recent from the tree, one
                  of which is called Kimkit, and another Boa Atap: and here are several others which
                  are eaten only by the natives, particularly the Kellor, the Guilindina, the
                  Moringa, and the Soccum. The Soccum is of the same kind with the bread-fruit in
                  the South Sea islands, but so much inferior, that if it had not been for the
                  similitude in the outward appearance both of the fruit and the tree, we should not
                  have referred it to that class. These and some others do not merit to be
                  particularly mentioned. </p><p n="1260">The quantity of fruit that is consumed at Batavia is incredible; but that
                  which is publicly exposed to sale is generally over-ripe. A stranger however may
                  get good fruit in a street called Passar Pissang, which lies north from the great
                  church, <pb n="741"/> and very near it.* This street is inhabited by none but
                  Chinese fruit-sellers, who are supplied from the gardens of Gentlemen in the
                  neighbourhood of the town, with such as is fresh, and excellent in its kind, for
                  which however they must be paid more than four times the market price. </p><p n="1261">The town in general is supplied from a considerable distance, where great
                  quantities of land are cultivated merely for the production of fruit. The country
                  people, to whom these lands belong, meet the people of the town at two great
                  markets; one on Monday, called Passar Sineen; and the other on Saturday, called
                  Passar Tanabank. These fairs are held at places considerably distant from each
                  other, for the convenience of different districts; neither of them however are
                  more than five miles distant from Batavia. At these fairs, the best fruit may be
                  bought at the cheapest rate; and the sight of them to a European is very
                  entertaining. The quantity of fruit is astonishing; forty or fifty cart loads of
                  the finest pine apples, packed as carelessly as turneps in England, are common,
                  and other fruit in the same profusion. The days however on which these markets are
                  held are ill contrived; the time between Saturday and Monday is too short, and
                  that between Monday and Saturday too long: great part of what is bought on Monday
                  is always much the worse for keeping before a new stock can be bought, either by
                  the retailer or consumer; so that for several days in every week there is no good
                  fruit in the hands of any people but the Chinese in Passar Pissang. </p><p n="1262">The inhabitants of this part of India practise a luxury which seems to be
                  but little attended to in other countries; they are continually burning aromatic
                  woods and resins, and scatter odours round them in a profusion of flowers,
                  possibly as an antidote to the noisome effluvia of their ditches <pb n="742"/> and
                  canals.* Of sweet smelling flowers they have a great variety, altogether unknown
                  in Europe, the chief of which I shall briefly describe. </p><p n="1263">1. The Champacka, or Michelia Champacca. This grows upon a tree as large
                  as an apple tree, and consists of fifteen long narrow petala, which give it the
                  appearance of being double, though in reality it is not so: its colour is yellow,
                  and much deeper than that of a jonquil, to which it has some resemblance in smell. </p><p n="1264">2. The Cananga, or Uvaria Cananga, is a green flower, not at all
                  resembling the blossom of any tree or plant in Europe: it has indeed more the
                  appearance of a bunch of leaves than a flower; its scent is agreeable, but
                  altogether peculiar to itself. </p><p n="1265">3. The Mulatti, or Nyctanthes Sambac. This is well known in English
                  hot-houses by the name of Arabian jessamine: it grows here in the greatest
                  profusion, and its fragrance, like that of all other Indian flowers, though
                  exquisitely pleasing, has not that over-powering strength which distinguishes some
                  of the same sorts in Europe. </p><p n="1266">4, 5. The Combang Caracnassi, and Combang Tonquin, Percularia Glabro.
                  These are small flowers, of the dog's-bane kind, very much resembling each other
                  in shape and smell, highly fragrant, but very different from every product of an
                  English garden. </p><p n="1267">6. The Bonga Tanjong, or Mimusops Elengi of Linnaeus. This flower is
                  shaped like a star of seven or eight rays, and is about half an inch in diameter;
                  it is of a yellowish colour, and has an agreeable smell. </p><p n="1268">Besides these, there is the Sundal Malam, or Polianthes Tuberosa. This
                  flower, being the same with our own tuberose, can <pb n="743"/> have no place
                  among those that are unknown in Europe,* but I mention it for its Malay name,
                  which signifies "Intriguer of the Night," and is not inelegantly conceived. The
                  heat of this climate is so great, that few flowers exhale their sweets in the day;
                  and this in particular, from its total want of scent at that time, and the modesty
                  of its colour, which is white, seems negligent of attracting admirers, but as soon
                  as night comes on, it diffuses its fragrance, and at once compels the attention,
                  and excites the complacency of all who approach it. </p><p n="1269">These are all sold about the streets every evening at sunset, either
                  strung upon a thread, in wreaths of about two feet long, or made up into nosegays
                  of different forms, either of which may be purchased for about a halfpenny.
                  Besides these, there are, in private gardens many other sweet flowers, which are
                  not produced in a sufficient quantity to be brought to market. With a mixture of
                  these flowers, and the leaves of a plant called pandang, cut into small pieces,
                  persons of both sexes fill their hair and their clothes, and with the same mixture
                  indulge a much higher luxury by strewing it on their beds, so that the chamber in
                  which they sleep, breathes the richest and purest of all odours, unallayed by the
                  fumes which cannot but arise where the sleeper lies under two or three blankets
                  and a quilt, for the bed covering here is nothing more than a single piece of fine
                  chintz. </p><p n="1270">Before I close my account of the vegetable productions of this part of
                  India, I must take some notice of the spices Java originally produced none but
                  pepper. This is now sent from hence into Europe to a great value, but the quantity
                  consumed here is very small: the inhabitants use Capsicum, or, as it is called in
                  Europe, Cayan pepper, almost universally in its stead. Cloves and nutmegs, having
                  been <pb n="744"/> monopolized by the Dutch,* are become too dear to be
                  plentifully used by the other inhabitants of this country, who are very fond of
                  them. Cloves, although they are said originally to have been the produce of
                  Machian, or Bachian, a small island far to the eastward, and only fifteen miles to
                  the northward of the line, and to have been from thence disseminated by the Dutch,
                  at their first coming into these parts, over all the eastern islands, are now
                  confined to Amboina, and the small isles that lie in its neighbourhood; the Dutch
                  having, by different treaties of peace between them and the conquered kings of all
                  the other islands, stipulated, that they should have only a certain number of
                  trees in their dominions, and in future quarrels, as a punishment for disobedience
                  and rebellion, lessened the quantity, till at last they left them no claim to any.
                  Nutmegs have in a manner been extirpated in all the islands except their first
                  native soil, Banda, which easily supplies every nation upon earth, and would as
                  easily supply every nation in another globe of the same dimensions, if there was
                  any such to which the industrious Hollander could transport the commodity; it is,
                  however, certain, that there are a few trees of this spice upon the coast of New
                  Guinea. There may perhaps be both cloves and nutmegs upon other islands to the
                  eastward; for those, neither the Dutch, nor any other European, seem to think it
                  worth while to examine. </p><p n="1271">The principal tame quadrupeds of this country are horses, cattle,
                  buffalos, sheep, goats, and hogs. The horses are small, never exceeding in size
                  what we call a stout galloway, but they are nimble and spirited, and are reported
                  to have been found here when the Europeans first came round the Cape of Good Hope.
                  The horned cattle are said to be the same species as those in Europe, but they
                  differ so much in appearance, that we were inclined to doubt it: they have indeed
                     <pb n="745"/> the palearia or dewlap,* which naturalists make the
                  distinguishing characteristic of the European species, but they certainly are
                  found wild, not only in Java but several of the eastern islands. The slesh of
                  those that we eat at Batavia, had a finer grain than European beef, but it was
                  less juicy, and miserably lean. Buffalos are plenty, but the Dutch never eat them,
                  nor will they drink their milk, being prepossessed with a notion that both are
                  unwholesome, and tend to produce fevers; though the natives and Chinese eat both,
                  without any injury to their health. The sheep are of the kind which have long ears
                  that hang down, and hair instead of wool: the flesh of these is hard and tough,
                  and in every respect the worst mutton we ever saw: we found here, however, a few
                  Cape sheep, which are excellent, but so dear that we gave five and forty shillings
                  a-piece for four of them, the heaviest of which weighed only five and forty
                  pounds. The goats are not better than the sheep, but the hogs, especially the
                  Chinese breed, are incomparable, and so fat, that the purchaser agrees for the
                  lean separately. The butcher, who is always a Chinese, without the least scruple
                  cuts off as much of the fat as he is desired, and afterwards sells it to his
                  countrymen, who melt it down, and eat it instead of butter with their rice: but
                  notwithstanding the excellence of this pork, the Dutch are so strongly prejudiced
                  in favour of every thing that comes from their native country, that they eat only
                  of the Dutch breed, which are here sold as much dearer than the Chinese, as the
                  Chinese are sold dearer than the Dutch in Europe. </p><p n="1272">Besides these animals, which are tame, they have dogs and cats, and there
                  are among the distant mountains some wild horses and cattle: buffalos are not
                  found wild in any part of Java, though they abound in Macassar, and several other
                  eastern islands. The neighbourhood of Batavia, however, <pb n="746"/> is
                  plentifully supplied with two kinds of deer,* and wild hogs, which are sold at a
                  reasonable price by the Portuguese, who shoot them, and are very good food. </p><p n="1273">Among the mountains, and in the desart parts of the island, there are
                  tygers, it is said, in great abundance, and some rhinoceroses; in these parts also
                  there are monkies, and there are a few of them even in the neighbourhood of
                  Batavia. </p><p n="1274">Of fish, here is an amazing plenty; many sorts are excellent, and all are
                  very cheap, except the few that are scarce. It happens here, as in other places,
                  that vanity gets the better even of appetite: the cheap fish, most of which is of
                  the best kind, is the food only of slaves, and that which is dear, only because it
                  is scarce, and very much inferior in every respect, is placed upon the tables of
                  the rich. A sensible housekeeper once spoke to us freely upon the subject. I know,
                  said he, as well as you, that I could purchase a better dish of fish for a
                  shilling, than what now costs me ten; but if I should make so good a use of my
                  money, I should here be as much despised, as you would be in Europe, if you were
                  to cover your table with offals, fit only for beggars or dogs. </p><p n="1275">Turtle is also found here, but it is neither so sweet nor so fat as the
                  West Indian turtle, even in London; such as it is, however, we should consider it
                  as a dainty; but the Dutch, among other singularities, do not eat it. We saw some
                  lizards, or Iguanas, here of a very large size; we were told that some were as
                  thick as a man's thigh, and Mr. Banks shot one that was five feet long: the flesh
                  of this animal proved to be very good food. </p><p n="1276">Poultry is very good here, and in great plenty: fowls of a very large
                  size, ducks, and geese are very cheap; pigeons <pb n="747"/> are dear, and the
                  price of turkies extravagant.* We sometimes found the flesh of these animals lean
                  and dry, but this was merely the effect of their being ill fed, for those that we
                  fed ourselves were as good as any of the same kind that we had tasted in Europe,
                  and we sometimes thought them even better. </p><p n="1277">Wild fowl in general is scarce. We once saw a wild duck in the fields,
                  but never any that were to be sold. We frequently saw snipes of two kinds, one of
                  them exactly the same as that in Europe, and a kind of thrush was always to be had
                  in great plenty of the Portuguese, who, for I know not what reason, seem to have
                  monopolized the wild fowl and game. Of snipes, it is remarkable that they are
                  found in more parts of the world than any other bird, being common almost all over
                  Europe, Asia, Africa, and America. </p><p n="1278">With respect to drink, Nature has not been quite so liberal to the
                  inhabitants of Java as to some whom she has placed in the less fruitful regions of
                  the north. The native Javanese, and most of the other Indians who inhabit this
                  island, are indeed Mahometans, and therefore have no reason to regret the want of
                  wine; but, as if the prohibition of their law respected only the manner of
                  becoming drunk, and not drunkenness itself, they chew opium, to the total
                  subversion not only of their understanding but their health. </p><p n="1279">The arrack that is made here, is too well known to need a description:
                  besides which, the palm yields a wine of the same kind with that which has already
                  been described in the account of the island of Savu; it is procured from the same
                  tree, in the same manner, and is sold in three states. The first, in which it is
                  called Tuac manise, differs little from that in which it comes from the tree; yet
                  even this has received <pb n="746"/>
                  <!--$B!R(B1 page duplicate$B!S(B--><pb n="747"/>
                  <!--$B!R(B1 page duplicate$B!S(B--><pb n="748"/> some preparation altogether unknown to us,* in consequence of which
                  it will keep eight and forty hours, though otherwise it would spoil in twelve: in
                  this state it has an agreeable sweetness, and will not intoxicate. In the other
                  two states it has undergone a fermentation, and received an infusion of certain
                  herbs and roots, by which it loses its sweetness, and acquires a taste very
                  austere and disagreeable. In one of these states it is called Tuac cras, and in
                  the other Tuac cuning, but the specific difference I do not know; in both,
                  however, it intoxicates very powerfully. A liquor called Tuac is also made from
                  the cocoa-nut tree, but this is used chiefly to put into the arrack, for in that
                  which is good it is an essential ingredient. </p></div><pb n="749"/><div type="chapter" n="42"><head><l>CHAP.XIV.</l><l><emph rend="italic"> Some Account of the Inhabitants of Batavia, and the
                        adjacent Country, their Manners, Customs, and Manner of Life.</emph></l></head><p n="1280">THE town of Batavia, although,* as I have already observed, it is the
                  capital of die Dutch dominions in India, is so far from being peopled with
                  Dutchmen, that not one fifth part, even of the European inhabitants of the town,
                  and its environs, are natives of Holland, or of Dutch extraction: the greater part
                  are Portuguese, and besides Europeans, there are Indians of various nations, and
                  Chinese, besides a great number of negro slaves. In the troops, there are natives
                  of almost every country in Europe, but the Germans are more than all the rest put
                  together; there are some English and French, but the Dutch, though other Europeans
                  are permitted to get money here, keep all the power in their own hands, and
                  consequently possess all public employments. No man, of whatever nation, can come
                  hither to settle, in any other character than that of a soldier in the Company's
                  service, in which, before they are accepted, they must covenant to remain five
                  years. As soon however as this form has been complied with, they are allowed, upon
                  application to the council, to absent themselves from their corps, and enter
                  immediately into any branch of trade, which their money or credit will enable them
                  to carry on; and by this means it is that all the white inhabitants of the place
                  are soldiers. </p><p n="1281">Women, however, of all nations, are permitted to settle here, without
                  coming under any restrictions; yet we were <pb n="750"/> told that there were
                  not,* when we were at Batavia, twenty women in the place that were born in Europe,
                  but that the white women, who were by no means scarce, were descendants from
                  European parents of the third or fourth generation, the gleanings of many families
                  who had successively come hither, and in the male line become extinct; for it is
                  certain that, whatever be the cause, this climate is not so fatal to the ladies as
                  to the other sex. </p><p n="1282">These women imitate the Indians in every particular; their dress is made
                  of the same materials, their hair is worn in the same manner, and they are equally
                  enslaved by the habit of chewing betel. </p><p n="1283">The merchants carry on their business here with less trouble perhaps than
                  in any other part of the world: every manufacture is managed by the Chinese, who
                  sell the produce of their labour to the merchant, resident here, for they are
                  permitted to sell it to no one else; so that when a ship comes in, and bespeaks
                  perhaps a hundred leagers of arrack, or any quantity of other commodities, the
                  merchant has nothing to do but to send orders to his Chinese to see them delivered
                  on board: he obeys the command, brings a receipt signed by the master of the ship
                  for the goods to his employer, who receives the money, and having deducted his
                  profit, pays the Chinese his demand. With goods that are imported, however, the
                  merchant has a little more trouble, for these he must examine, receive, and lay up
                  in his warehouse, according to the practice of other countries. </p><p n="1284">The Portuguese are called by the natives Oranserane, or Nazareen men,
                  (Oran, being Man in the language of the country,) to distinguish them from other
                  Europeans; yet they are included in the general appellation of Caper, or Cafir, an
                  opprobrious term, applied by Mahometans to all who do not <pb n="751"/> profess
                  their faith. These people, however,* are Portuguese only in name; they have
                  renounced the religion of Rome, and become Lutherans: neither have they the least
                  communication with the country of their forefathers, or even knowlege of it: they
                  speak indeed a corrupt dialect of the Portuguese language, but much more
                  frequently use the Malay: they are never suffered to employ themselves in any but
                  mean occupations: many of them live by hunting, many by washing linen, and some
                  are handicraftsmen and artificers. They have adopted all the customs of the
                  Indians, from whom they are distinguished chiefly by their features and
                  complexion, their skin being considerably darker, and their noses more sharp;
                  their dress is exactly the same, except in the manner of wearing their hair. </p><p n="1285">The Indians, who are mixed with the Dutch and Portuguese in the town of
                  Batavia, and the country adjacent, are not, as might be supposed, Javanese, the
                  original natives of the island, but natives of the various islands from which the
                  Dutch import slaves, and are either such as have themselves been manumized, or the
                  descendants of those who formerly received manumission; and they are all
                  comprehended under the general name of Oranslam, or Isalam, signifying Believers
                  of the true Faith. The natives of every country, however, in other respects keep
                  themselves distinct from the rest, and are not less strongly marked than the
                  slaves by the vices or virtues of their respective nations. Many of these employ
                  themselves in the cultivation of gardens, and in selling fruit and flowers. The
                  betel and areca, which are here called Siri and Pinang, and chewed by both sexes
                  and every rank in amazing quantities, are all grown by these Indians: lime is also
                  mixed with these roots here as it is in Savu, but it is less pernicious to the
                  teeth, because it is first slaked, and, besides the lime, a substance called
                     gambir,<pb n="752"/> which is brought from the continent of India;* the better
                  sort of women also add cardamum, and many other aromatics, to give the breath an
                  agreeable smell. Some of the Indians, however, are employed in fishing, and as
                  lightermen, to carry goods from place to place by water; and some are rich, and
                  live with much of the splendour of their country, which chiefly consists in the
                  number of their slaves. </p><p n="1286">In the article of food these Isalams are remarkably temperate: it
                  consists chiefly of boiled rice, with a small proportion of buffalo, fish, or
                  fowl, and sometimes of dried fish, and dried shrimps, which are brought hither
                  from China; every dish, however, is highly seasoned with Cayan pepper, and they
                  have many kinds of pastry made of rice flower, and other things to which I am a
                  stranger; they eat also a great deal of fruit, particularly plantanes. </p><p n="1287">But notwithstanding their general temperance, their feasts are plentiful,
                  and, according to their manner, magnificent. As they are Mahometans, wine and
                  strong liquors professedly make no part of their entertainment, neither do they
                  often indulge with them privately, contenting themselves with their betel and
                  opium. </p><p n="1288">The principal solemnity among them is a wedding, upon which occasion both
                  the families borrow as many ornaments of gold and silver as they can, to adorn the
                  bride and bride-groom, so that their dresses are very showy and magnificent. The
                  feasts that are given upon these occasions among the rich, last sometimes a
                  fortnight, and sometimes longer; and during this time, the man, although married
                  on the first day, is, by the women, kept from his wife. </p><p n="1289">The language that is spoken among all these people, from what place
                  soever they originally came, is the Malay; at least it is a language so called,
                  and probably it is a very <pb n="753"/> corrupt dialect of that spoken at
                  Malacca.* Every little island indeed has a language of its own, and Java has two
                  or three, but this lingua franca is the only language that is now spoken here,
                  and, as I am told, it prevails over a great part of the East Indies. A dictionary
                  of Malay and English was published in London by Thomas Bowrey, in the year 1701. </p><p n="1290">Their women wear as much hair as can grow upon the head, and to increase
                  the quantity, they use oils, and other preparations of various kinds. Of this
                  ornament Nature has been very liberal; it is universally black, and is formed into
                  a kind of circular wreath upon the top of the head, where it is fastened with a
                  bodkin, in a taste which we thought inexpressibly elegant: the wreath of hair is
                  surrounded by another of flowers, in which the Arabian jessamine is beautifully
                  intermixed with the golden stars of the Bonger Tanjong. </p><p n="1291">Both sexes constantly bathe themselves in the river at least once a day,
                  a practice which, in this hot country, is equally necessary both to personal
                  delicacy and health. The teeth of these people also, whatever they may suffer in
                  their colour by chewing beetle, are an object of great attention: the ends of
                  them, both in the upper and under jaw, are rubbed with a kind of whetstone, by a
                  very troublesome and painful operation, till they are perfectly even and slat, so
                  that they cannot lose less than half a line in their length. A deep grove is then
                  made cross the teeth of the upper jaw, parallel with the gums, and in the middle
                  between them and the extremity of the teeth; the depth of this groove is at least
                  equal to one-fourth of the thickness of the teeth, so that it penetrates far
                  beyond what is called the enamel, the least injury to which, according to the
                  dentists of Europe, is fatal; yet among these people, where the practice of thus
                  wounding the enamel is universal, we never saw a rotten <pb n="750"/> told that
                  there were not,* when we were at Batavia, twenty women in the place that were born
                  in Europe, but that the white women, who were by no means scarce, were descendants
                  from European parents of the third or fourth generation, the gleanings of many
                  families who had successively come hither, and in the male line become extinct;
                  for it is certain that, whatever be the cause, this climate is not so fatal to the
                  ladies as to the other sex. </p><p n="1292">These women imitate the Indians in every particular; their dress is made
                  of the same materials, their hair is worn in the same manner, and they are equally
                  enslaved by the habit of chewing betel. </p><p n="1293">The merchants carry on their business here with less trouble perhaps than
                  in any other part of the world: every manufacture is managed by the Chinese, who
                  sell the produce of their labour to the merchant, resident here, for they are
                  permitted to sell it to no one else; so that when a ship comes in, and bespeaks
                  perhaps a hundred leagers of arrack, or any quantity of other commodities, the
                  merchant has nothing to do but to send orders to his Chinese to see them delivered
                  on board: he obeys the command, brings a receipt signed by the master of the ship
                  for the goods to his employer, who receives the money, and having deducted his
                  profit, pays the Chinese his demand. With goods that are imported, however, the
                  merchant has a little more trouble, for these he must examine, receive, and lay up
                  in his warehouse, according to the practice of other countries. </p><p n="1294">The Portuguese are called by the natives Oranserane, or Nazareen men,
                  (Oran, being Man in the language of the country,) to distinguish them from other
                  Europeans; yet they are included in the general appellation of Caper, or Cafir, an
                  opprobrious term, applied by Mahometans to all who do not <pb n="751"/> profess
                  their faith. These people, however,* are Portuguese only in name; they have
                  renounced the religion of Rome, and become Lutherans: neither have they the least
                  communication with the country of their forefathers, or even knowlege of it: they
                  speak indeed a corrupt dialect of the Portuguese language, but much more
                  frequently use the Malay: they are never suffered to employ themselves in any but
                  mean occupations: many of them live by hunting, many by washing linen, and some
                  are handicraftsmen and artificers. They have adopted all the customs of the
                  Indians, from whom they are distinguished chiefly by their features and
                  complexion, their skin being considerably darker, and their noses more sharp;
                  their dress is exactly the same, except in the manner of wearing their hair. </p><p n="1295">The Indians, who are mixed with the Dutch and Portuguese in the town of
                  Batavia, and the country adjacent, are not, as might be supposed, Javanese, the
                  original natives of the island, but natives of the various islands from which the
                  Dutch import slaves, and are either such as have themselves been manumized, or the
                  descendants of those who formerly received manumission; and they are all
                  comprehended under the general name of Oranslam, or Isalam, signifying Believers
                  of the true Faith. The natives of every country, however, in other respects keep
                  themselves distinct from the rest, and are not less strongly marked than the
                  slaves by the vices or virtues of their respective nations. Many of these employ
                  themselves in the cultivation of gardens, and in selling fruit and flowers. The
                  betel and areca, which are here called Siri and Pinang, and chewed by both sexes
                  and every rank in amazing quantities, are all grown by these Indians: lime is also
                  mixed with these roots here as it is in Savu, but it is less pernicious to the
                  teeth, because it is first slaked, and, besides the lime, a substance called
                     gambir,<pb n="752"/> which is brought from the continent of India;* the better
                  sort of women also add cardamum, and many other aromatics, to give the breath an
                  agreeable smell. Some of the Indians, however, are employed in fishing, and as

                  wounding the enamel is universal, we never saw a rotten <pb n="754"/> tooth;* nor
                  is the blackness a stain, but a covering, which may be washed off at pleasure, and
                  the teeth then appear as white as ivory, which however is not an excellence in the
                  estimation of the belles and beaus of these nations. </p><p n="1302">These are the people among whom the practice that is called a mock, or
                  running a muck, has prevailed for time immemorial. It is well known, that to run a
                  muck in the original sense of the word, is to get intoxicated with opium, and then
                  rush into the street with a drawn weapon, and kill whoever comes in the way, till
                  the party is himself either killed or taken prisoner; of this several instances
                  happened while we were at Batavia, and one of the officers, whose business it is,
                  among other things, to apprehend such people, told us, that there was scarcely a
                  week in which he, or some of his brethren, were not called upon to take one of
                  them into custody. In one of the instances that came to our knowlege, the party
                  had been severely injured by the perfidy of women, and was mad with jealousy
                  before he made himself drunk with opium; and we were told, that the Indian who
                  runs a muck is always first driven to desperation by some outrage, and always
                  first revenges himself upon those who have done him wrong: we were also told, that
                  though these unhappy wretches afterwards run into the street with a weapon in
                  their hand, frantic and foaming at the mouth, yet they never kill any but those
                  who attempt to apprehend them, or those whom they suspect of such an intention,
                  and that whoever gives them way is safe. They are generally slaves, who indeed are
                  most subject to insults, and least able to obtain legal redress: freemen, however,
                  are sometimes provoked into this extravagance, and one of the persons who run a
                  muck while we were at Batavia, was free and in easy circumstances. He was jealous
                  of his own brother, whom he first killed, and afterwards two others, who attempted
                  to oppose <pb n="755"/> him: he did not, however, come out of his house,* but
                  endeavoured to defend himself in it, though the opium had so far deprived him of
                  his senses, that of three muskets, which he attempted to use against the officers
                  of justice, not one was either loaded or primed. If the officer takes one of these
                  amocks, or mohawks, as they have been called by an easy corruption, alive, his
                  reward is very considerable, but if he kills them, nothing is added to his usual
                  pay; yet such is the fury of their desperation, that three out of four are of
                  necessity destroyed in the attempt to secure them, though the officers are
                  provided with instruments like large tongs, or pincers, to lay hold of them
                  without coming within the reach of their weapon. Those who happen to be taken
                  alive are generally wounded, but they are always broken alive upon the wheel, and
                  if the physician who is appointed to examine their wounds, thinks them likely to
                  be mortal, the punishment is inflicted immediately, and the place of execution is
                  generally the spot where the first murder was committed. </p><p n="1303">Among these people, there are many absurd practices and opinions which
                  they derive from their Pagan ancestors: they believe that the devil, whom they
                  call Satan, is the cause of all sickness and adversity, and for this reason, when
                  they are sick, or in distress, they consecrate meat, money, and other things to
                  him as a propitiation. If any one among them is restless, and dreams for two or
                  three nights successively, he concludes that Satan has taken that method of laying
                  his commands upon him, which if he neglects to fulfil, he will certainly suffer
                  sickness or death, though they are not revealed with sufficient perspicuity to
                  ascertain their meaning: to interpret his dream, therefore, he taxes his wits to
                  the uttermost, and if, by taking it literally or figuratively, directly or by
                  contraries, he can put no explanation <pb n="756"/> upon it that perfectly
                  satisfies him,* he has recourse to the cawin or priest, who assists him with a
                  comment and illustrations, and perfectly reveals the mysterious suggestions of the
                  night. It generally appears that the devil wants victuals or money, which are
                  always allotted him, and being placed on a little plate of cocoa-nut leaves, are
                  hung upon the branch of a tree near the river, so that it seems not to be the
                  opinion of these people, that in prowling the earth the devil "walketh through dry
                  places." Mr. Banks once asked, whether they thought Satan spent the money, or eat
                  the victuals; he was answered, that as to the money it was considered rather as a
                  mulct upon an offender, than a gift to him who had enjoined it, and that therefore
                  if it was devoted by the dreamer, it mattered not into whose hands it came, and
                  they supposed that it was generally the prize of some stranger who wandered that
                  way; but as to the meat they were clearly of opinion that, although the devil did
                  not eat the gross parts, yet, by bringing his mouth near it, he sucked out all its
                  savour without changing its position, so that afterwards it was as tasteless as
                  water. </p><p n="1304">But they have another superstitious opinion that is still more
                  unaccountable. They believe that women, when they are delivered of children, are
                  frequently at the same time delivered of a young crocodile, as a twin to the
                  infant: they believe that these creatures are received most carefully by the
                  midwife, and immediately carried down to the river, and put into the water. The
                  family in which such a birth is supposed to have happened, constantly put victuals
                  into the river for their amphibious relation, and especially the twin, who, as
                  long as he lives, goes down to the river at stated seasons, to fulfil this
                  fraternal duty, for the neglect of which it is the universal opinion that he will
                  be visited with sickness or death. What could at first produce a notion so <pb n="757"/> extravagant and absurd, it is not easy to guess,* especially as it
                  seems to be totally unconnected with any religious mystery, and how a fact which
                  never happened, should be pretended to happen every day, by those who cannot be
                  deceived into a belief of it by appearances, nor have any apparent interest in the
                  fraud, is a problem still more difficult to solve. Nothing however can be more
                  certain than the firm belief of this strange absurdity among them, for we had the
                  concurrent testimony of every Indian who was questioned about it, in its favour.
                  It seems to have taken its rise in the islands of Celebes and Boutou, where many
                  of the inhabitants keep crocodiles in their families; but however that be, the
                  opinion has spread over all the eastern islands, even to Timor and Ceram, and
                  westward as far as Java and Sumatra, where, however, young crocodiles are, I
                  believe, never kept. </p><p n="1305">These crocodile twins are called Sudaras, and I shall relate one of the
                  innumerable stories that were told us, in proof of their existence, from ocular
                  demonstration. </p><p n="1306">A young female slave, who was born and bred up among the English at
                  Bencoolen, and had learnt a little of the language, told Mr. Banks that her
                  father, when he was dying, acquainted her that he had a crocodile for his sudara,
                  and solemnly charged her to give him meat when he should be dead, telling her in
                  what part of the river he was to be found, and by what name he was to be called
                  up. That in pursuance of her father's instructions and command, she went to the
                  river, and standing upon the bank, called out Radja Pouti, white king, upon which
                  a crocodile came to her out of the water, and eat from her hand the provisions
                  that she had brought him. When she was desired to describe this paternal uncle,
                  who in so strange a shape had taken up his dwelling in the water, she said, that
                  he was not like <pb n="758"/> other crocodiles,* but much handsomer; that his body
                  was spotted and his nose red; that he had bracelets of gold upon his feet, and
                  earrings of the same metal in his ears. Mr. Banks heard this tale of ridiculous
                  falsehood patiently to the end, and then dismissed the girl, without reminding
                  her, that a crocodile with ears was as strange a monster as a dog with a cloven
                  foot. Some time after this a servant whom Mr. Banks had hired at Batavia, and who
                  was the son of a Dutchman by a Javanese woman, thought fit to acquaint his master
                  that he had seen a crocodile of the same kind, which had also been seen by many
                  others, both Dutchmen and Malays: that being very young, it was but two feet long,
                  and had bracelets of gold upon its feet. There is no giving credit to these
                  stories, said Mr. Banks, for I was told the other day that a crocodile had
                  earrings; and you know that could not be true, because crocodiles have no ears. Ah
                  Sir, said the man, these Sudara Oran are not like other crocodiles; they have five
                  toes upon each foot, a large tongue that fills their mouth, and ears also,
                  although they are indeed very small. </p><p n="1307">How much of what these people related they believed, cannot be known; for
                  there are no bounds to the credulity of ignorance and folly. In the girl's
                  relation, however, there are some things in which she could not be deceived; and
                  therefore must have been guilty of wilful falsehood. Her father might perhaps give
                  her a charge to feed a crocodile, in consequence of his believing that it was his
                  Sudara; but its coming to her out of the river, when she called it by the name of
                  White King, and taking the food she had brought it, must have been a fable of her
                  own invention; for this being false, it was impossible that she should believe it
                  to be true. The girl's story, however, as well as that of the man, is a strong
                  proof that they both firmly believed the existence <pb n="759"/> of crocodiles
                  that are Sudaras to men;* and the girl's fiction will be easily accounted for, if
                  we recollect, that the earnest desire which every one feels to make others believe
                  what he believes himself, is a strong temptation to support it by unjustifiable
                  evidence. And the averring what is known to be false, in order to produce in
                  others the belief of what is thought to be true, must, upon the most charitable
                  principles, be imputed to many, otherwise venerable characters, through whose
                  hands the doctrines of Christianity passed for many ages in their way to us, as
                  the source of all the silly fables related of the Romish saints, many of them not
                  less extravagant and absurd than this story of the White King, and all of them the
                  invention of the first relater. </p><p n="1308">The Bougis, Macassars, and Boetons, are so firmly persuaded that they
                  have relations of the crocodile species in the rivers of their own country, that
                  they perform a periodical ceremony in remembrance of them. Large parties of them
                  go out in a boat, furnished with great plenty of provisions, and all kinds of
                  music, and row backwards and forwards, in places where crocodiles and allegators
                  are most common, singing and weeping by turns, each invoking his kindred, till a
                  crocodile appears, when the music instantly stops, and provisions, betele, and
                  tobacco are thrown into the water. By this civility to the species, they hope to
                  recommend themselves to their relations at home; and that it will be accepted
                  instead of offerings immediately to themselves, which it is not in their power to
                  pay. </p><p n="1309">In the next rank to the Indians stand the Chinese, who in this place are
                  numerous, but possess very little property; many of them live within the walls,
                  and keep shops. The fruit-sellers of Passar Pissang have been mentioned already;
                  but others have a rich show of European and Chinese goods: <pb n="760"/> the far
                  greater part however live in a quarter by themselves,* without the walls, called
                  Campang China. Many of them are carpenters, joiners, smiths, taylors, slipper
                  makers, dyers of cotton, and embroiderers; maintaining the character of industry
                  that is universally given of them: and some are scattered about the country, where
                  they cultivate gardens, fow rice and sugar, or keep cattle and buffaloes, whose
                  milk they bring daily to town. </p><p n="1310">There is nothing clean or dirty, honest or dishonest, provided there is
                  not too much danger of a halter, that the Chinese will not readily do for money.
                  But though they work with great diligence, and patiently undergo any degree of
                  labour; yet no sooner have they laid down their tools than they begin to game,
                  either at cards or dice, or some other play among the multitude that they have
                  invented, which are altogether unknown in Europe: to this they apply with such
                  eagerness, as scarcely to allow time for the necessary refreshments of food and
                  sleep; so that it as rare to see a Chinese idle, as it is to see a Dutchman or an
                  Indian employed. </p><p n="1311">In manners they are always civil, or rather obsequious; and in dress they
                  are remarkably neat and clean, to whatever rank of life they belong. I shall not
                  attempt a description either of their persons or habits, for the better kind of
                  China paper, which is now common in England, exhibits a perfect representation of
                  both, though perhaps with some slight exaggerations approaching towards the
                  caricatura. </p><p n="1312">In eating they are easily satisfied, though the few that are rich have
                  many savory dishes. Rice, with a small proportion of flesh or fish, is the food of
                  the poor; and they have greatly the advantage of the Mahometan Indians, whose
                  religion forbids them to eat of many things which they could most easily procure.
                  The Chinese, on the contrary, being <pb n="761"/> under no restraint, eat, besides
                  pork, dogs, cats, frogs, lizards,* serpents of many kinds, and a great variety of
                  sea animals, which the other inhabitants of this country do not consider as food:
                  they eat also many vegetables, which an European, except he was perishing with
                  hunger, would never touch. </p><p n="1313">The Chinese have a singular superstition with regard to the burial of
                  their dead; for they will upon no occasion open the ground a second time, where a
                  body has been interred. Their burying grounds, therefore, in the neighbourhood of
                  Batavia, cover many hundred acres, and the Dutch, grudging the waste of so much
                  land, will not sell any for this purpose but at the most exorbitant price. The
                  Chinese, however, contrive to raise the purchase money, and afford another
                  instance of the folly and weakness of human nature, in transferring a regard for
                  the living to the dead, and making that the object of solicitude and expence,
                  which cannot receive the least benefit from either. Under the influence of this
                  universal prejudice, they take an uncommon method to preserve the body intire, and
                  prevent the remains of it from being mixed with the earth that surrounds it. They
                  inclose it in a large thick coffin of wood, not made of planks joined together,
                  but hollowed out of the solid timber like a canoe; this being covered, and let
                  down into the grave, is surrounded with a coat of their mortar, called Chinam,
                  about eight or ten inches thick, which in a short time becomes as hard as a stone.
                  The relations of the deceased attend the funeral ceremony, with a considerable
                  number of women that are hired to weep: it might reasonably be supposed that the
                  hired appearance of sorrow could no more slatter the living than benefit the dead;
                  yet the appearance of sorrow is known to be hired among people much more
                  reflective and enlightened than the Chinese. In Batavia, the law requires <pb n="762"/> that every man should be buried according to his rank,* which is in
                  no case dispensed with; so that if the deceased has not left sufficient to pay his
                  debts, an officer takes an inventory of what was in his possession when he died,
                  and out of the produce buries him in the manner prescribed, leaving only the
                  overplus to his creditors. Thus in many instances are the living sacrificed to the
                  dead, and money that should discharge a debt, or feed an orphan, lavished in idle
                  processions, or deposited in the earth to rot. </p><p n="1314">Another numerous class among the inhabitants of this country is the
                  slaves; for by slaves the Dutch, Portuguese, and Indians, however different in
                  their rank or situation, are constantly attended: they are purchased from Sumatra,
                  Malacca, and almost all the eastern islands. The natives of Java, very few of
                  whom, as I have before observed, live in the neighbourhood of Batavia, have an
                  exemption from slavery under the sanction of very severe penal laws, which I
                  believe are seldom violated. The price of these slaves is from ten to twenty
                  pounds sterling; but girls, if they have beauty, sometimes fetch a hundred. They
                  are a very lazy set of people; but as they will do but little work, they are
                  content with a little victuals, subsisting altogether upon boiled rice, and a
                  small quantity of the cheapest fish. As they are natives of different countries,
                  they differ from each other extremely, both in person and disposition. The African
                  negroes, called here Papua, are the worst, and consequently may be purchased for
                  the least money: they are all thieves, and all •ncorrigible. Next to these are the
                  Bougis and Macassars, both from the island of Celebes; these are lazy in the
                  highest degree, and though not so much addicted to theft as the negroes, have a
                  cruel and vindictive spirit, which renders them extremely dangerous; especially
                  as, to gratify their <pb n="763"/> resentment, they will make no scruple of
                  sacrificing life.* The best slaves, and consequently the dearest, are procured
                  from the island of Bali: the most beautiful women from Nias, a small island on the
                  coast of Sumatra; but they are of a tender and delicate constitution, and soon
                  fall a sacrifice to the unwholesome air of Batavia. Besides these, there are
                  Malays, and slaves of several other denominations, whose particular
                  characteristics I do not remember. </p><p n="1315">These slaves are wholly in the power of their masters with respect to any
                  punishment that does not take away life; but if a slave dies in consequence of
                  punishment, though his death should not appear to have been intended, the master
                  is called to a severe account, and he is generally condemned to suffer capitally.
                  For this reason the master seldom inflicts punishment upon the slave himself, but
                  applies to an officer called a Marineu, one of whom is stationed in every
                  district. The duty of the Marineu is to quell riots, and take offenders into
                  custody; but more particularly to apprehend runaway slaves, and punish them for
                  such crimes as the master, supported by proper evidence, lays to their charge: the
                  punishment however is not inflicted by the Marineu in person, but by slaves who
                  are bred up to the business. Men are punished publicly, before the door of their
                  master's house; but women within it. The punishment is by stripes, the number
                  being proportioned to the offence; and they are given with rods made of rattans,
                  which are split into slender twigs for the purpose, and fetch blood at every
                  stroke. A common punishment costs the master a rixdollar, and a severe one a
                  ducatoon, about six shillings and eight pence. The master is also obliged to allow
                  the slave three dubbeleheys, equal to about seven pence half-penny a week, as an
                  encouragement, and to prevent his being under temptations to steal too strong to
                  be resisted. </p><p n="1316"><pb n="764"/>*Concerning the government of this place I can say but little. We
                  observed however a remarkable subordination among the people. Every man who is
                  able to keep house has a certain specific rank acquired by the length of his
                  services to the company; the different ranks which are thus acquired are
                  distinguished by the ornaments of the coaches and the dresses of the coachmen:
                  some are obliged to ride in plain coaches, some are allowed to paint them in
                  different manners and degrees, and some to gild them. The coachman also appears in
                  clothes that are quite plain, or more or less adorned with lace. </p><p n="1317">The officer who presides here has the title of Governor General of the
                  Indies, and the Dutch Governors of all the other settlements are subordinate to
                  him, and obliged to repair to Batavia that he may pass their accounts. If they
                  appear to have been criminal, or even negligent, he punishes them by delay, and
                  detains them during pleasure, sometimes one year, sometimes two years, and
                  sometimes three; for they cannot quit the place till he gives them a dismission.
                  Next to the Governor are the members of the council, called here Edele Heeren, and
                  by the corruption of the English, Idoleers. These Idoleers take upon them so much
                  state that whoever meets them in a carriage, is expected to rise up and bow, then
                  to drive on one side of the road, and there stop till they are past: the same
                  homage is required also to their wives and even their children; and it is commonly
                  paid them by the inhabitants. But some of our Captains have thought so slavish a
                  mark of respect beneath the dignity which they derived from the service of his
                  Britannic Majesty, and have refused to pay it; yet, if they were in a hired
                  carriage, nothing could deter the coachman from honouring the Dutch Grandee at
                  their expence, but the most peremptory menace of immediate death. </p><p n="1318"><pb n="765"/>Justice is administered here by a body of lawyers,* who have ranks of
                  distinction among themselves. Concerning their proceedings in questions of
                  property, I know nothing; but their decisions in criminal cases seem to be severe
                  with respect to the natives, and lenient with respect to their own people, in a
                  criminal degree. A Christian always is indulged with an opportunity of escaping
                  before he is brought to a trial, whatever may have been his offence; and if he is
                  brought to a trial and convicted, he is seldom punished with death: while the poor
                  Indians on the contrary are hanged, and broken upon the wheel, and even impaled
                  alive without mercy. </p><p n="1319">The Malays and Chinese have judicial officers of their own, under the
                  denominations of Captains and Lieutenants, who determine in civil cases, subject
                  to an appeal to the Dutch court. </p><p n="1320">The taxes paid by these people to the Company are very considerable; and
                  that which is exacted of them for liberty to wear their hair, is by no means the
                  least. They are paid monthly, and to save the trouble and charge of collecting
                  them, a slag is hoisted upon the top of a house in the middle of the town when a
                  payment is due, and the Chinese have experienced that it is their interest to
                  repair thither with their money without delay. </p><p n="1321">The money current here consists of ducats, worth a hundred and thirty-two
                  stivers; ducatoons, eighty stivers; imperial rixdollars, sixty; rupees of Batavia,
                  thirty; schellings, six; double cheys, two stivers and a half; and doits, one
                  fourth of a stiver. Spanish dollars, when we were here, were at five shillings and
                  five pence; and we were told, that they were never lower than five shillings and
                  four pence, even at <pb n="766"/> the Company's warehouse.* For English guineas we
                  could never get more than nineteen shillings upon an average; for though the
                  Chinese would give twenty shillings for some of the brightest, they would give no
                  more than seventeen shillings for those that were much worn. </p><p n="1322">It may perhaps be of some advantage to strangers to be told that there
                  are two kinds of coin here, of the same denomination, milled and unmilled, and
                  that the milled is of most value. A milled ducatoon is worth eighty stivers; but
                  an unmilled ducatoon is worth no more than seventy-two. All accounts are kept in
                  rixdollars and stivers, which, here at least, are mere nominal coins, like our
                  pound sterling. The rixdollar is equal to forty-eight stivers, about four
                  shillings and six pence English currency. </p></div><pb n="767"/><div type="chapter" n="43"><head><l>CHAP.XV.</l><l><emph rend="italic"> The Passage from Batavia to the Cape of Good Hope: Some

                  the afternoon of the <date>5th</date>,* when we anchored under the south east side of Prince's
                  Island in eighteen fathom, in order to recruit our wood and water, and procure
                  refreshments for the sick, many of whom were now become much worse than they were
                  when we left Batavia. As soon as the ship was secured, I went ashore accompanied
                  by Mr. Banks and Dr Solander, and we were met upon the beach by some Indians who
                  carried us immediately to a man, who, they said, was their King. After we had
                  exchanged a few compliments with his Majesty, we proceeded to business; but <pb n="768"/> in settling the price of turtle we could not agree:* this however did
                  not discourage us, as we made no doubt but that we should buy them at our own
                  price in the morning. As soon as we parted, the Indians dispersed, and we
                  proceeded along the shore in search of a watering-place. In this we were more
                  successful; we found water very conveniently situated, and, if a little care was
                  taken in filling it, we had reason to believe that it would prove good. Just as we
                  were going off, some Indians, who remained with a canoe upon the beach, sold us
                  three turtle; but exacted a promise of us that we should not tell the King. </p><p n="1325">*The next morning, while a party was employed in filling water, we
                  renewed our traffic for turtle: at first, the Indians dropped their demands
                  slowly, but about noon, they agreed to take the price that we offered, so that
                  before night we had turtle in plenty: the three that we had purchased the evening
                  before, were in the mean time served to the ship's company, who, till the day
                  before, had not once been served with salt provisions from the time of our arrival
                  at Savu, which was now near four months In the evening, Mr. Banks went to pay his
                  respects to the King, at his palace, in the middle of a rice field, and though his
                  Majesty was busily employed in dressing his own supper, he received the stranger
                  very graciously. </p><p n="1326">The next day, the natives came down to the trading-place, with fowls,
                  fish, monkies, small deer, and some vegetables, but no turtle, for they said that
                  we had bought them all the day before. The next day, however, more turtle appeared
                  at market, and some were brought down every day afterwards, during our stay,
                  though the whole, together, was not equal to the quantity that we bought the day
                  after our arrival. </p><p n="1327"><pb n="769"/>On the <date>11th</date>,* Mr. Banks having learnt from the servant whom he had
                  hired at Batavia, that the Indians of this island had a town upon the shore, at
                  some distance to the westward, he determined to see it: with this view he set out
                  in the morning, accompanied by the Second Lieutenant, and as he had some reason to
                  think that his visit would not be agreeable to the inhabitants, he told the people
                  whom he met, as he was advancing along the shore, that he was in search of plants,
                  which indeed was also true. In about two hours they arrived at a place where there
                  were four or five houses, and meeting with an old man, they ventured to make some
                  enquiries concerning the town. He said that it was far distant; but they were not
                  to be discouraged in their enterprise, and he, seeing them proceed in their
                  journey, joined company and went on with them. He attempted several times to lead
                  them out of the way, but without success; and at length they came within fight of
                  the houses. The old man then entered cordially into their party, and conducted
                  them into the town. The name of it is Samadang, it consists of about four hundred
                  houses, and is divided by a river of brackish water into two parts, one of which
                  is called the old town and the other the new. As soon as they entered the old
                  town, they met several Indians whom they had seen at the trading-place, and one of
                  them undertook to carry them over to the new town, at the rate of two pence a
                  head. When the bargain was made, two very small canoes were produced, in which
                  they embarked; the canoes being placed alongside of each other, and held together,
                  a precaution which was absolutely necesssary to prevent their oversetting, the
                  navigation was at length safely performed, though not without some difficulty; and
                  when they landed in the new town, the people received them with great friendship,
                  and showed them the houses of their Kings and principal people, which <pb n="770"/> are in this district:* few of them however were open, for at this time the
                  people had taken up their residence in the rice-grounds, to defend the crop
                  against the birds and monkies, by which it would otherwise have been destroyed.
                  When their curiosity was satisfied, they hired a large sailing boat for two
                  roupees, four shillings, which brought them back to the ship time enough to dine
                  upon one of the small deer, weighing only forty pounds, which had been bought the
                  day before, and proved to be very good and savory meat. </p><p n="1328">We went on shore in the evening, to see how the people who were employed
                  in wooding and watering went on, and were informed that an ax had been stolen. As
                  the passing over this fault might encourage the commission of others of the same
                  kind, application was immediately made to the King, who after some altercation
                  promised that the ax should be restored in the morning;* and kept his word, for it
                  was brought to us by a man who pretended that the thief, being afraid of a
                  discovery, had privately brought it and left it at his house in the night. </p><p n="1329">We continued to purchase between two and three hundred weight of turtle
                  in a day, besides fowls and other necessaries; and in the evening of the <date>13th</date>,*
                  having nearly completed our wood and water, Mr. Banks went ashore to take leave of
                  his Majesty, to whom he had made several trifling presents, and at parting gave
                  him two quires of paper, which he graciously received. They had much conversation,
                  in the course of which his Majesty enquired, why the English did not touch there
                  as they had been used to do. Mr. Banks replied, that he supposed it was because
                  they found a deficiency of turtle, of which there not being enough to supply one
                  ship, many could not be expected. To supply this defect, he advised his Majesty to
                  breed cattle, buffaloes, and <pb n="771"/> sheep, a measure which he did not seem
                  much inclined to adopt.* </p><p n="1330">On the <date>14th</date> we made ready to sail,* having on board a good stock of
                  refreshments, which we purchased of the natives, consisting of turtle, fowl, fish,
                  two species of deer, one as big as a sheep, the other not larger than a rabbit;
                  with cocoa-nuts, plantains, limes, and other vegetables. The deer however served
                  only for present use, for we could seldom keep one of them alive more than four
                  and twenty hours after it was on board. On our part, the trade was carried on
                  chiefly with Spanish dollars, the natives seeming to set little value upon any
                  thing else; so that our people, who had a general permission to trade, parted with
                  old shirts and other articles, which they were obliged to substitute for money to
                  great disadvantage. In the morning of the <date>15th</date>, we weighed,* with a light breeze
                  at N.E. and stood out to sea. Java Head, from which I took my departure, lies in
                  latitude <geo select="lat" n="163">6° 49′ S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="163">253° 12′ W</geo>. </p><p n="1331">Prince's Island, where we lay about ten days, is, in the Malay language,
                  called Pulo Selan; and in the language of the inhabitants, Pulo Paneitan. It is a
                  small island, situated in the western mouth of the Streight of Sunda. It is woody,
                  and a very small part of it only has been cleared: there is no remarkable hill
                  upon it, yet the English call the small eminence which is just over the
                  landing-place the Pike. It was formerly much frequented by the India ships of many
                  nations, but especially those of England, which of late have forsaken it, as it is
                  said, because the water is bad; and touch either at North Island, a small island
                  that lies on the coast of Sumatra, without the east entrance of the Streight, or
                  at New Bay, which lies only a few leagues from Prince's Island, at neither of
                  which places any considerable quantity <pb n="772"/> of other refreshments can be
                  procured.* Prince's Island is, upon the whole, certainly more eligible than either
                  of them; and though the water is brackish, if it is filled at the lower part of
                  the brook, yet higher up it will be found excellent. </p><p n="1332">The first and second, and perhaps the third ship that comes in the season
                  may be tolerably supplied with turtle; but those that come afterwards must be
                  content with small ones. Those that we bought were of the green kind, and at an
                  average cost us about a half-penny or three farthings a pound. We were much
                  disappointed to find them neither fat nor well flavoured; and we imputed it to
                  their having been long kept in crawls or pens of brackish water, without food. The
                  fowls are large, and we bought a dozen of them for a Spanish dollar, which is
                  about five pence a piece: the small deer cost us two pence a piece, and the
                  larger, of which two only were brought down, a rupee. Many kinds of fish are to be
                  had here, which the natives sell by hand, and we found them tolerably cheap.
                  Cocoa-nuts we bought at the rate of a hundred for a dollar, if they were picked;
                  and if they were taken promiscuously, one hundred and thirty. Plantains we found
                  in great plenty; we procured also some pine apples, water melons, jaccas, and
                  pumpkins; besides rice, the greater part of which was of the mountain kind, that
                  grows in dry land; yams, and several other vegetables, at a very reasonable rate. </p><p n="1333">The inhabitants are Javanese, whose Raja is subject to the Sultan of
                  Bantam. Their customs are very similar to those of the Indians about Batavia; but
                  they seem to be more jealous of their women, for we never saw any of them during
                  all the time that we were there, except one by chance in the woods, as she was
                  running away to hide herself. They profess the Mahometan religion, but I believe
                  there is not a <pb n="773"/> mosque in the whole island:* we were among them
                  during the fast, which the Turks call Ramadan, which they seemed to keep with
                  great rigour, for not one of them would touch a morsel of victuals, or even chew
                  their betel till sun-set. </p><p n="1334">Their food is nearly the same as that of the Batavian Indians, except the
                  addition of the nuts of the palm, called Cycas circinalis, with which, upon the
                  coast of New Holland, some of our people were made sick, and some of our hogs
                  poisoned. </p><p n="1335">Upon observing these nuts to be part of their food, we enquired by what
                  means they deprived them of their deleterious quality; and they told us, that they
                  first cut them into thin slices, and dried them in the sun, then steeped them in
                  fresh water for three months, and afterwards, pressing out the water, dried them
                  in the sun a second time; but we learnt that, after all, they are eaten only in
                  times of scarcity, when they mix them with their rice to make it go farther. </p><p n="1336">The houses of their town are built upon piles, or pillars, four or five
                  feet above the ground: upon these is laid a floor of bamboo canes, which are
                  placed at some distance from each other, so as to leave a free passage for the air
                  from below: the walls also are of bamboo, which are interwoven, hurdlewise, with
                  small sticks, that are fastened perpendicularly to the beams which form the frame
                  of the building: it has a sloping roof, which is so well thatched with palm
                  leaves, that neither the sun nor the rain can find entrance. The ground over which
                  this building is created, is an oblong square. In the middle of one side is the
                  door, and in the middle between that and the end of the house, towards the left
                  hand, is a window: a partition runs out from each end towards the middle, which,
                  if continued, would divide the whole floor into two equal parts, longitudinally,
                     <pb n="774"/> but they do not meet in the middle,* so that an opening is left
                  over-against the door; each end of the house therefore, to the right and left of
                  the door, is divided into two rooms, like stalls in a stable, all open towards the
                  passage from the door to the wall on the opposite side: in that next the door, to
                  the left hand, the children sleep; that opposite to it, on the right hand, is
                  allotted to strangers; the master and his wife sleep in the inner room on the left
                  hand, and that opposite to it is the kitchen. There is no difference between the
                  houses of the poor and the rich, but in the size; except that the royal palace,
                  and the house of a man, whose name is Gundang, the next in riches and influence to
                  the King, is walled with boards instead of being wattled with sticks and bamboo. </p><p n="1337">As the people are obliged to abandon the town, and live in the
                  rice-fields at certain seasons, to secure their crops from the birds and the
                  monkies, they have occasional houses there for their accommodation. They are
                  exactly the same as the houses in the town, except that they are smaller, and are
                  elevated eight or ten feet above the ground instead of four. </p><p n="1338">The disposition of the people, as far as we could discover it, is good.
                  They dealt with us very honestly, except, like all other Indians, and the
                  itinerant retailers of fish in London, they asked sometimes twice, and sometimes
                  thrice as much for their commodities as they would take. As what they brought to
                  market, belonged, in different proportions, to a considerable number of the
                  natives, and it would have been difficult to purchase it in separate lots, they
                  found out a very easy expedient with which every one was satisfied: they put all
                  that was bought of one kind, as plantains, or cocoa-nuts, together, and when we
                  had agreed for the heap, they divided the money that was paid for it, among those
                     <pb n="775"/> of whose separate property it consisted,* in a proportion
                  corresponding with their contributions. Sometimes, indeed, they changed our money,
                  giving us 240 doits, amounting to five shillings, for a Spanish dollar, and
                  ninety-six, amounting to two shillings, for a Bengal roupee. </p><p n="1339">They all speak the Malay language, though they have a language of their
                  own, different both from the Malay and the Javanese. Their own language they call
                  Catta Gunung, the language of the mountains; and they say that it is spoken upon
                  the mountains of Java, whence their tribe originally migrated, firs to New Bay,
                  and then to their present station, being driven from their first settlement by
                  tygers, which they found too numerous to subdue. I have already observed, that
                  several languages are spoken by the native Javanese, in different parts of their
                  island; but when I say that the language of these people is different from the
                  Javanese, I mean that it is different from the language which is spoken at
                  Samarang, a place that is distant only one day's journey from the residence of the
                  emperor of Java. The following is a list of corresponding words in the languages

                  names of different parts of the body are chosen, because they are easily obtained
                  from people whose language is utterly unknown, and because they are more likely to
                  be part of the original stamen of the language, than any other, as types of the
                  first objects to which they would give names. It is very remarkable that the
                  Malay, the Javanese, and the Prince's Island language, have words, which, if not
                  exactly similar to the corresponding words in the language of the islands in the
                  South Seas, are manifestly derived from the same source, as will appear from the

                  from the following comparative table, which Mr. Banks drew up, with the assistance
                  of a negro slave, born at Madagascar, who was on board an English ship at Batavia,
                  and sent to him to gratify his curiosity on this subject. </p><p n="1343">English. S. Sea Islands. Malay. Javanese. Prince's Island. Madagascar.

                  the same import in the Malay. The nose in Malay is called Erung, at Madagascar
                  Ourou; Lida, the <pb n="778"/> tongue,* is Lala; Tangan, the hand, is Tang; and
                  Tanna, the ground, is Taan. </p><p n="1344">From the similitude between the language of the Eastern Indies, and the
                  islands of the South Sea, conjectures may be formed with respect to the peopling
                  those countries, which cannot easily be referred to Madagascar. The inhabitants of
                  Java and Madagascar appear to be a different race; the Javanese is of an olive
                  complexion, and has long hair; the native of Madagascar is black, and his head is
                  not covered with hair, but wool; and yet perhaps this will not conclude against
                  their having common ancestors so strongly as at first appears. It does not seem
                  less difficult to account for the personal difference between a native of England
                  and France, as an effect of mere local situation, than for the difference between
                  the natives of Java and Madagascar; yet it has never been supposed, that England
                  and France were not peopled from common ancestors. If two natives of England marry
                  in their own country, and afterwards remove to our settlements in the West Indies,
                  the children that are conceived and born there will have the complexion and cast
                  of countenance that distinguish the Creole; if they return, the children conceived
                  and born afterwards, will have no such characteristics. If it be said that the
                  mother's mind being impressed with different external objects, impresses
                  corresponding features and complexion upon the child during her pregnancy, it will
                  be as difficult to refer the effect into this cause, upon mere physical
                  principles, as into the other; for it can no more be shewn how a mere idea,
                  conceived in the mother's imagination, can change the corporeal form of her
                  infant, than how its form can be changed by mere local situation. We know that
                  people within the small circle of Great Britain and Ireland, who are born at the
                  distance of two or three hundred miles from each other, will be distinguished by
                  the Scotch <pb n="779"/> face, the Welsh face, and the Irish face;* may we not
                  then reasonably suppose, that there are in nature qualities which act powerfully
                  as efficient causes, and yet are not cognizable by any of the five modes of
                  perception which we call senses? A deaf man, who sees the string of a harpsichord
                  vibrate, when a corresponding tone is produced by blowing into a flute at a
                  distance, will see an effect of which he can no more conceive the cause to exist
                  in the blowing air into the flute, than we can conceive the cause of the personal
                  difference of the various inhabitants of the globe to exist in mere local
                  situation; nor can he any more form an idea of the cause itself, in one case, than
                  we can in the other: what happens to him then, in consequence of having but four
                  senses instead of five, may, with respect to many phaenomena of nature, happen to
                  us, in consequence of having but five senses instead of six, or any greater
                  number. </p><p n="1345">Possibly, however, the learning of ancient Aegypt might run in two
                  courses, one through Africa, and the other through Asia, disseminating the same
                  words in each, especially terms of number, which might thus become part of the
                  language of people who never had any communication with each other. </p><p n="1346">We now made the best of our way for the Cape of Good Hope, but the seeds
                  of disease which we had received at Batavia began to appear with the most
                  threatening symptoms in dysenteries and slow fevers. Lest the water which we had
                  taken in at Prince's Island should have had any share in our sickness, we purified
                  it with lime, and we washed all parts of the ship between decks with vinegar, as a
                  remedy against infection. Mr. Banks was among the sick, and for some time there
                  was no hope of his life. We were very soon in a most deplorable situation; the
                  ship was nothing better than <pb n="780"/> an hospital,* in which those that were
                  able to go about, were too few to attend the sick, who were confined to their
                  hammocks; and we had almost every night a dead body to commit to the sea. In the
                  course of about six weeks, we buried Mr. Sporing, a gentleman who was in Mr.
                  Banks's retinue, Mr. Parkinson, his natural history painter, Mr. Green the
                  astronomer, the boatswain, the carpenter and his mate, Mr. Monkhouse the
                  midshipman, who had fothered the ship after she had been stranded on the coast of
                  New Holland, our old jolly sail-maker and his assistant, the ship's cook, the
                  corporal of the marines, two of the carpenter's crew, a midshipman, and nine
                  seamen; in all three and twenty persons, besides the seven that we buried at
                  Batavia. </p></div><pb n="781"/><div type="chapter" n="44"><head><l>CHAP.XVI.</l><l><emph rend="italic"> Our Arrival at the Cape of Good Hope; some Remarks on the

                  anchored off the Cape of Good Hope, in seven fathom with an ouzey bottom. The west
                  point of the bay, called the Lion's Tail, bore W. N. W. and the castle S. W.
                  distant about a mile and a half. I immediately waited upon the Governor, who told
                  me that I should have every thing the country afforded. My first care was to
                  provide a proper place ashore for the sick, which were not a few; and a house was
                  soon found, where it was agreed they should be lodged and boarded at the rate of
                  two shillings a head per day. </p><p n="1348">Our run from Java head, to this place, afforded very few subjects of
                  remark that can be of use to future navigators; such as occurred, however, I shall
                  set down. We had left Java Head eleven days before we got the general south east
                  trade-wind, during which time, we did not advance above <geo select="lat">5°</geo> to the
                  southward, and <geo select="lon">3°</geo> to the west, having variable light airs, interrupted
                  by calms, with sultry weather, and an unwholesome air, occasioned probably by the
                  load of vapours which the eastern trade-wind, and westerly monsoons, bring into
                  these latitudes, both which blow in these seas at the time of year when we
                  happened to be there. The easterly <pb n="782"/> wind prevails as far as 10 or
                  <geo select="lat">12° S</geo>. and the westerly as far as 6 or <geo select="lon">8°</geo>;* in the
                  intermediate space the winds are variable, and the air, I believe, always
                  unwholesome; it certainly aggravated the diseases which we brought with us from
                  Batavia, and particularly the flux, which was not in the least degree checked by
                  any medicine, so that whoever was seized with it, considered himself as a dead
                  man; but we had no sooner got into the trade-wind, than we began to feel its
                  salutary effects: we buried indeed several of our people afterwards, but they were
                  such as had been taken on board in a state so low and feeble that there was
                  scarcely a possibility of their recovery. At first we suspected that this dreadful
                  disorder might have been brought upon us by the water that we took on board at
                  Prince's Island, or even by the turtle that we bought there; but there is not the
                  least reason to believe that this suspicion was well grounded, for all the ships
                  that came from Batavia at the same season, suffered in the same degree, and some
                  of them even more severely, though none of them touched at Prince's Island in
                  their way. </p><p n="1349">A few days after we left Java, we saw boobies about the ship for several
                  nights successively, and as these birds are known to roost every night on shore,
                  we thought them an indication that some island was not far distant; perhaps it
                  might be the island of Selam, which, in different charts, is very differently laid
                  down both in name and situation. </p><p n="1350">The variation of the compass off the west coast of Java is about <geo select="lon">3°
                     W</geo>. and so it continued without any sensible variation, in the common
                  track of ships to the longitude of <geo select="lon">288° W</geo>. latitude 22 S. after which
                  it increased apace, so that in longitude <geo select="lon">295°</geo>, latitude
                  <geo select="lat">230°</geo>, the variation was <geo select="lon">10° 20′ W</geo>.: in seven degrees more of
                  longitude, and one of latitude, it increased <pb n="783"/> two degrees; in the
                  same space, farther to the west,* it increased five degrees: in latitude
                  <geo select="lat" n="164">28°</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon" n="164">314°</geo>, it was <geo select="lon">24° 20′</geo>, in
                  latitude <geo select="lat">29°</geo> longitude <geo select="lon">317°</geo>, it was <geo select="lon">26° 10′</geo>, and
                  was then stationary for the space of about ten degrees farther to the west; but in
                  latitude <geo select="lat">34°</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon">333°</geo>, we observed it twice to be
                     <geo select="lon">28°¼ W</geo>. and this was its greatest variation, for in latitude
                  <geo select="lat">35°½</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon">337°</geo>, it was <geo select="lon">24°</geo>, and
                  continued gradually to decrease; so that off Cape Anguillas it was <geo select="lon">22°
                     30′</geo>, and in Table Bay <geo select="lon">20° 30′ W</geo>. </p><p n="1351">As to currents it did not appear that they were at all considerable, till
                  we came within a little distance of the meridian of Madagascar; for after we had
                  made <geo select="lon">52°</geo> of longitude from Java Head, we found, by observation, that
                  our error in longitude was only two degrees, and it was the same when we had made
                  only nineteen. This error might be owing partly to a current setting to the
                  westward, partly to our not making proper allowances for the setting of the sea
                  before which we run, and perhaps to an error in the assumed longitude of Java
                  Head. If that longitude is erroneous, the error must be imputed to the
                  imperfection of the charts of which I made use in reducing the longitude from
                  Batavia, to that place, for there can be no doubt but that the longitude of
                  Batavia is well determined. After we had passed the longitude of <geo select="lon">307°</geo>,
                  the effects of the westerly currents began to be considerable; for in three days,
                  our error in longitude was <geo select="lon">1° 5′</geo>: the velocity of the current kept
                  increasing, as we proceeded to the westward, in so much that for five days
                  successively after we made the land, we were driven to the S. W. or S. W. by W.
                  not less than twenty leagues a day; and this continued till we were within sixty
                  or seventy leagues of the Cape, where the current set sometimes one way, and
                  sometimes the other, though inclining rather to the westward. </p><p n="1352"><pb n="784"/>*After the boobies had left us, we saw no more birds till we got
                  nearly abreast of Madagascar, where, in latitude <geo select="lat">27° ¾ S</geo>. we saw an
                  albatross, and after that time we saw them every day in great numbers, with birds
                  of several other sorts, particularly one about as big as a duck, of a very dark
                  brown colour, with a yellowish bill. These birds became more numerous as we
                  approached the shore, and as soon as we got into soundings we saw gannets, which
                  we continued to see as long as we were upon the bank which stretches off Anguillas
                  to the distance of forty leagues, and extends along the shore to the eastward,
                  from Cape False, according to some charts, one hundred and sixty leagues. The real
                  extent of this bank is not exactly known; it is however useful as a direction to
                  shipping when to haul in, in order to make the land. </p><p n="1353">While we lay here, the Houghton Indiaman sailed for England, who, during
                  her stay in India, lost by sickness between thirty and forty men; and when she
                  left the Cape had many in a helpless condition with the scurvy. Other ships
                  suffered in the same proportion, who had been little more than twelve months
                  absent from England; our sufferings therefore were comparatively light,
                  considering that we had been absent near three times as long. </p><p n="1354">Having lain here to recover the sick, procure stores, and perform several
                  necessary operations upon the ship and rigging,* till the <date>13th of April</date>, I then
                  got all the sick on board, several of whom were still in a dangerous state, and
                  having taken leave of the Governor,* I unmoored the next morning, and got ready to
                  sail. </p><p n="1355">The Cape of Good Hope has been so often described, and is so well known
                  in Europe, that I shall mention only a few <pb n="785"/> particulars,* which in
                  other relations are omitted or misrepresented. </p><p n="1356">Notwithstanding all that has been said to the contrary, no country that
                  we saw during the voyage makes a more forlorn appearance, or is in reality a more
                  sterile desart. The land over the Cape, which constitutes the peninsula formed by
                  Table Bay on the north, and False Bay on the south, consists of high mountains,
                  altogether naked and desolate: the land behind these to the east, which may be
                  considered as the isthmus, is a plain of vast extent, consisting almost wholly of
                  a light kind of sea sand, which produces nothing but heath, and is utterly
                  incapable of cultivation. All the spots that will admit of improvement, which
                  together bear about the same proportion to the whole as one to one thousand, are
                  laid out in vineyards, orchards, and kitchen grounds; and most of these little
                  spots lie at a considerable distance from each other. There is also the greatest
                  reason to believe, that in the interior parts of this country, that which is
                  capable of cultivation does not bear a greater proportion to that which is
                  incorrigibly barren; for the Dutch told us, that they had settlements eight and
                  twenty days journey up the country, a distance equal to at least nine hundred
                  miles, from which they bring provisions to the Cape by land; so that it seems
                  reasonable to conclude that provisions are not to be had within a less compass.
                  While we were at the Cape, a farmer came thither from the country, at the distance
                  of fifteen days journey, and brought his young children with him. We were
                  surprised at this, and asked him, if it would not have been better to have left
                  them with his next neighbour: Neighbour! said the man, I have no neighbour within
                  less than five days journey of me. Surely the country must be deplorably barren in
                  which those who settle only to raise <pb n="786"/> provisions for a market,* are
                  dispersed at such distances from each other. That the country is every where
                  destitute of wood appears to demonstration; for timber and planks are imported
                  from Batavia, and fuel is almost as dear as food. We saw no tree, except in
                  plantations near the town, that was six feet high; and the stems, that were not
                  thicker than a man's thumb, had roots as thick as an arm or a leg, such is the
                  influence of the winds here to the disadvantage of vegetation, setting the
                  sterility of the soil out of the question. </p><p n="1357">The only town which the Dutch have built here is, from its situation,
                  called Cape Town, and consists of about a thousand houses, neatly built of brick,
                  and in general whited on the outside; they are however covered only with thatch,
                  for the violence of the south east winds would render any other roof inconvenient
                  and dangerous. The streets are broad and commodious, all crossing each other at
                  right angles. In the principal street there is a canal, on each side of which is
                  planted a row of oaks, that have flourished tolerably well, and yield an agreeable
                  shade: there is a canal also in one other part of the town, but the slope of the
                  ground in the course of both is so great, that they are furnished with floodgates,
                  or locks, at intervals of little more than fifty yards. </p><p n="1358">A much greater proportion of the inhabitants are Dutch in this place than
                  in Batavia; and as the town is supported principally by entertaining strangers,
                  and supplying them with necessaries, every man, to a certain degree, imitates the
                  manners and customs of the nation with which he is chiefly concerned. The ladies
                  however are so faithful to the mode of their country, that not one of them will
                  stir without a chaudpied or chausset, which is carried by a servant that it may be
                  ready to place under her feet whenever she shall sit down. This practice is the
                  more remarkable, as very few of <pb n="787"/> these chaussets have sire in them,*
                  which indeed the climate renders unnecessary. </p><p n="1359">The women in general are very handsome; they have fine clear skins, and a
                  bloom of colour that indicates a purity of constitution, and high health. They
                  make the best wives in the world, both as mistresses of a family and mothers; and
                  there is scarcely a house that does not swarm with children. </p><p n="1360">The air is salutary in a high degree; so that those who bring diseases
                  hither from Europe, generally recover perfect health in a short time; but the
                  diseases that are brought from India are not so certainly cured. </p><p n="1361">Notwithstanding the natural sterility of the climate, industry has
                  supplied this place with all the necessaries, and even the luxuries of life in the
                  greatest profusion. The beef and mutton are excellent, though the cattle and sheep
                  are natives of the country; the cattle are lighter than ours, more neatly made,
                  and have horns that spread to a much wider extent. The sheep are clothed with a
                  substance between wool and hair, and have tails of an enormous size; we saw some
                  that weighed twelve pounds, and were told that there were many much larger. Good
                  butter is made of the milk of the cows, but the cheese is very much inferior to
                  our own. Here are goats, but they are never eaten, hogs, and a variety of poultry.
                  Hares are also found here, exactly like those of Europe; antelopes of many kinds,
                  quails of two sorts, and bustards, which are well flavoured, but not juicy. The
                  fields produce European wheat and barley, and the gardens European vegetables, and
                  fruit of all kinds, besides plantains, guavas, jambu, and some other Indian
                  fruits, but these are not in perfection; the plantains in particular, are very
                  bad, and the guavas no larger than gooseberries. The vineyards also produce wine
                  of various sorts, but not equal to those of Europe, except <pb n="788"/> the
                  Constantia,* which is made genuine only at one vineyard, about ten miles distant
                  from the town. There is another vineyard near it, where wine is made that is
                  called by the same name, but it is greatly inferior. </p><p n="1362">The common method in which strangers live here, is to lodge and board
                  with some of the inhabitants, many of whose houses are always open for their
                  reception: the rates are from five shillings to two shillings a day, for which all
                  necessaries are found. Coaches may be hired at four and twenty shillings a day,
                  and horses at six shillings; but the country affords very little temptation to use
                  them. There are no public entertainments; and those that are private, to which
                  strangers of the rank of Gentlemen are always admitted, were suspended while we
                  were there by the breaking out of the measles. </p><p n="1363">At the farther end of the High-street, the Company have a garden, which
                  is about two thirds of an English mile long; the whole is divided by walks that
                  intersect each other at right angles, and are planted with oaks that are clipt
                  into wall hedges, except in the center walk, where they are suffered to grow to
                  their full size, and afford an agreeable shade, which is the more welcome, as,
                  except the plantations by the sides of the two canals, there is not a single tree
                  that would serve even for a shepherd's bush, within many miles of the town. The
                  greater part of this garden is kitchen ground; but two small squares are allotted
                  to botanical plants, which did not appear to be so numerous by one half as they
                  were when Oldenland wrote his catalogue. At the farther end of the garden is a
                  menagerie, in which there are many birds and beasts that are never seen in Europe;
                  particularly a beast called by the Hottentots Coe Doe, which is as large as a
                  horse, and has the fine spiral horns which <pb n="789"/> are sometimes seen in
                  private and public collections of curiosities.* </p><p n="1364">Of the natives of this country, we could learn but little except from
                  report; for there were none of their habitations, where alone they retain their
                  original customs, within less than four days journey from the town; those that we
                  saw at the Cape were all servants to Dutch farmers, whose cattle they take care
                  of, and are employed in other drudgery of the meanest kind. These are in general
                  of a slim make, and rather lean than plump, but remarkably strong, nimble, and
                  active. Their size is nearly the same with that of Europeans, and we saw some that
                  were six feet high: their eyes are dull and without expression: their skins are of
                  the colour of soot, but that is in a great measure caused by the dirt, which is so
                  wrought into the grain that it cannot be distinguished from complexion; for I
                  believe they never wash any part of their bodies. Their hair curls strongly, not
                  like a negroe's, but falls in ringlets about seven or eight inches long. Their
                  clothing consists of a skin, generally that of a sheep, thrown over their
                  shoulders; besides which, the men wear a small pouch in the middle of the waist,
                  and the women, a broad leather flap, both which hang from a girdle or belt that is
                  adorned with beads and small pieces of copper. Both men and women wear necklaces,
                  and sometimes bracelets, of beads; and the women wear rings of hard leather round
                  their ancles, to defend them from the thorns, with which their country every where
                  abounds: some of them have a sandal, made of wood or bark; but the greater part of
                  them are unshod. </p><p n="1365">To a European, their language appears to be scarcely articulate; besides
                  which it is distinguished by a very remarkable singularity. At very frequent
                  intervals, while they are <pb n="790"/> speaking,* they cluck with the tongue
                  against the roof of the mouth: these clucks do not appear to have any meaning, but
                  rather to divide what they say into sentences. Most of these Hottentots speak
                  Dutch, without any peculiarity of pronunciation. </p><p n="1366">They are all modest, even to sheepishness; for it was not without the
                  greatest difficulty that we could persuade any of them to dance, or even to speak
                  in their own language to each other, in our presence. We did however both see them
                  dance, and hear them sing; their dances are by turns active and sluggish to
                  excess; sometimes consisting of quick and violent motions, with strange
                  distortions of the body, and unnatural leaps backwards and forwards, with the legs
                  crossing each other; and being sometimes so spiritless that the dancer only
                  strikes the ground first with one foot and then with the other, neither changing
                  place nor moving any other part of his body: the songs also are alternately to
                  quick and slow movements, in the same extremes as the dance. </p><p n="1367">We made many enquiries concerning these people of the Dutch, and the
                  following particulars are related upon the credit of their report: </p><p n="1368">Within the boundaries of the Dutch settlements there are several nations
                  of these people, who very much differ from each other in their customs and manner
                  of life: all however are friendly and peaceable, except one clan that is settled
                  to the eastward, which the Dutch call Bosch men, and these live entirely by
                  plunder, or rather by theft; for they never attack their neighbours openly, but
                  steal the cattle privately in the night. They are armed however to defend
                  themselves, if they happen to be detected, with lances or assagays, and arrows,
                  which they know how to poison by various ways, some with the juice of herbs, and
                  some with the venom <pb n="791"/> of the serpent called Cobra di Capelo;* in the
                  hands of these people a stone also is a very formidable weapon, for they can throw
                  it with such force and exactness as repeatedly to hit a dollar at the distance of
                  a hundred paces. As a defence against these freebooters, the other Indians train
                  up bulls, which they place round their towns in the night, and which, upon the
                  approach of either man or beast, will assemble and oppose them, till they hear the
                  voice of their masters encouraging them to fight, or calling them off, which they
                  obey with the same docility as a dog. </p><p n="1369">Some nations have the art of melting and preparing copper, which is found
                  among them, probably native; and of this they make broad plates, which they wear
                  as ornaments upon their foreheads. Some of them also know how to harden bits of
                  iron, which they procure from the Dutch, and form into knives, so as to give them
                  a temper superior to that of any they can buy. </p><p n="1370">The Chiefs, many of whom are possessors of very numerous herds of cattle,
                  are generally clad in the skins of lions, tygers, or zebras, to which they add
                  fringes, and other ornaments in a very good taste. Both sexes frequently anoint
                  the body with grease, but never use any that is rancid or foetid, if fresh can be
                  had. Mutton suet and butter are generally used for this purpose; butter is
                  perferred, which they make by shaking the milk in a bag made of the skin of some
                  beast. </p><p n="1371">We were told that the priest certainly gives the nuptial benediction by
                  sprinkling the bride and bridegroom with his urine. But the Dutch universally
                  declared that the women never wrapped the entrails of sheep round their legs, as
                  they have been said to do, and afterwards make them part of their food.
                  Semicastration was also absolutely denied to be <pb n="792"/> general;* but it was
                  acknowledged that some among the particular nation which knew how to melt copper
                  had suffered that operation, who were said to be the best warriors, and
                  particularly to excel in the art of throwing stones. </p><p n="1372">We were very desirous to determine the great question among natural
                  historians, whether the women of this country have or have not that fleshy flap or
                  apron which has been called the Sinus pudoris, and what we learnt I shall relate.
                  Many of the Dutch and Malays, who said they had received favours from Hottentots
                  women, positively denied its existence; but a physician of the place declared that
                  he had cured many hundreds of venereal complaints, and never saw one without two
                  fleshy, or rather skinny appendages, proceeding from the upper part of the Labia,
                  in appearance somewhat resembling the teats of a cow, but flat; they hung down, he
                  said, before the Pudendum, and were in different subjects of different lengths, in
                  some not more than half an inch, in others three or four inches: these he imagined
                  to be what some writers have exaggerated into a flap, or apron, hanging down from
                  the bottom of the abdomen, of sufficient extent to render an artificial covering
                  of the neighbouring parts unnecessary. </p><p n="1373">Thus much for the country, its productions, and inhabitants. The bay is
                  large, safe, and commodious; it lies open indeed to the north west winds, but they
                  seldom blow hard; yet as they sometimes send in a great sea, the ships moor N. E.
                  and S. W. so as to have an open hawser with north west winds: the south east winds
                  blow frequently with great violence, but as this direction is right out of the
                  bay, they are not dangerous. Near the town a wharf of wood is run out to a proper
                  distance for the convenience of landing and shipping goods. To this wharf water is
                  conveyed in pipes, from which <pb n="793"/> several boats may fill water at the
                  same time;* and several large boats or hoys are kept by the Company to carry
                  stores and provisions to and from the shipping in the harbour. The bay is defended
                  by a square fort, situated close to the beach on the east side of the town, and by
                  several outworks and batteries extending along the shore, as well on this side of
                  the town as the other; but they are so situated as to be cannonaded by shipping,
                  and are in a manner defenceless against an enemy of any force by land. The
                  garrison consists of eight hundred regular troops, besides militia of the country,
                  in which is comprehended every man able to bear arms. They have contrivances to
                  alarm the whole country by signals in a very short time, and the militia is then
                  to repair immediately to the town. </p><p n="1374">The French at Mauritius are supplied from this place with salted beef,
                  biscuit, flour, and wine: the provisions for which the French contracted this year
                  were 500,000 lb. weight of salt beef, 400,000 lb. of flour, 400,000 lb. of
                  biscuit, and 1,200 leagers of wine. </p><p n="1375">In the morning of the <date>14th</date>,* we weighed and stood out of the bay; and at
                  five in the evening anchored under Penquin, or Robin Island: we lay here all
                  night, and as I could not sail in the morning for want of wind, I sent a boat to
                  the island for a few trifling articles which we had forgot to take in at the Cape.
                  But as soon as the boat came near the shore, the Dutch hailed her, and warned the
                  people not to land at their peril, bringing down at the same time six men armed
                  with musquets, who paraded upon the beach. The officer who commanded the boat not
                  thinking it worth while to risk the lives of the people on board for the sake of a
                  few cabbages, which were all we wanted, returned to the ship. At first we were at
                  a loss to account for our repulse, but we <pb n="794"/> afterwards recollected,*
                  that to this island the Dutch at the Cape banish such criminals as are not thought
                  worthy of death, for a certain number of years, proportioned to the offence; and
                  employ them as slaves in digging lime-stone, which though scarce upon the
                  continent is plenty here: and that a Danish ship, which by sickness had lost great
                  part of her crew, and had been refused assistance at the Cape, came down to this
                  island, and sending her boat ashore, secured the guard, and took on board as many
                  of the criminals as she thought proper to navigate her home: we concluded
                  therefore that the Dutch, to prevent the rescue of their criminals in time to
                  come, had given order to their people here to suffer no boat of any foreign nation
                  to come ashore. </p><p n="1376">*On the <date>25th</date>, at three o'clock in the afternoon, we weighed, with a light
                  breeze at S. E. and put to sea. About an hour afterwards, we lost our Master, Mr.
                  Robert Mollineux, a young man of good parts, but unhappily given up to
                  intemperance, which brought on disorders that put an end to his life. </p><p n="1377">We proceeded in our voyage homeward without any remarkable incident;* and
                  in the morning of the <date>29th</date>, we crossed our first meridian, having circumnavigated
                  the globe in the direction from east to west, and consequently lost a day, for
                  which we made an allowance at Batavia. </p><p n="1378">*At day-break, on the <date>1st of May</date>, we saw the island of St. Helena; and at
                  noon, we anchored in the road before James's fort. </p><p n="1379">We staid here till the <date>4th</date>, to refresh, and Mr. Banks improved the time
                  in making the complete circuit of the island, and visiting the most remarkable
                  places upon it. </p><p n="1380"><pb n="795"/>It is situated as it were in the middle of the vast Atlantic ocean,*
                  being four hundred leagues distant from the coast of Africa, and six hundred from
                  that of America. It is the summit of an immense mountain rising out of the sea,
                  which, at a little distance all round it, is of an unfathomable depth, and is no
                  more than twelve leagues long, and six broad. </p><p n="1381">The seat of volcanoes has, without exception, been found to be the
                  highest part of the countries in which they are found. Aetna and Vesuvius have no
                  land higher than themselves, in their neighbourhood; Hecla is the highest hill in
                  Iceland; volcanoes are frequent in the highest part of the Andes in South America;
                  and the pike of Teneriffe is known to be the covering of subterraneous fire: these
                  are still burning, but there are innumerable other mountains which bear evident
                  marks of fire that is now extinct, and has been so from the time of our earliest
                  traditions: among these is Saint Helena, where the inequalities of the ground, in
                  its external surface, are manifestly the effect of the sinking of the earth, for
                  the opposite ridges, though separated always by deep, and sometimes by broad
                  vallies, are exactly similar both in appearance and direction; and that the
                  sinking of the earth in these parts, was caused by subterraneous fire, is equally
                  manifest from the stones, for some of them, especially those in the bottom of the
                  vallies, are burnt almost to a cinder: in some there are small bubbles, like those
                  that are seen in glass which has been urged almost to fusion, and some, though at
                  first sight they do not appear to have been exposed to the action of great heat,
                  will be found, upon a closer inspection, to contain small pieces of extraneous
                  bodies, particularly mundick, which have yielded to the power of fire, though it
                  was not sufficient to alter the appearance of the stone which contained them. </p><p n="1382"><pb n="796"/>*It appeared, as we approached it on the windward side, like a rude
                  heap of rocks, bounded by precipices of amazing height, and consisting of a kind
                  of half friable stone, which shows not the least sign of vegetation; nor is it
                  more promising upon a nearer view: in sailing along the shore, we came so near the
                  huge cliffs, that they seemed to over-hang the ship, and the tremendous effect of
                  their giving way, made us almost fear the event: at length we opened a valley,
                  called Chappel Valley, which resembles a large trench; and in this valley we
                  discovered the town. The bottom of it is slightly covered with herbage, but the
                  sides are as naked as the cliffs that are next the sea. Such is the first
                  appearance of the island in its present cultivated state, and the first hills must
                  be passed before the vallies look green, or the country displays any other marks
                  of fertility. </p><p n="1383">The town stands just by the sea side, and the far greater part of the
                  houses are ill built; the church, which originally was a mean structure, is in
                  ruins, and the market-house is nearly in the same condition. </p><p n="1384">The white inhabitants are all English, who, as they are not permitted by
                  the East India Company, to whom the island belongs, to carry on any trade or
                  commerce on their own account, subsist wholly by supplying such ships as touch at
                  the place with refreshments, which, however, they do not provide in proportion to
                  the fertility of the soil, and the temperament of the climate, which would enable
                  them, by cultivation, to produce all the fruits and vegetables both of Europe and
                  India. This island indeed, small as it is, enjoys the different advantages of
                  different climates, for the cabbage trees which grow upon the highest ridges, can
                  by no art be cultivated upon the ridges next below, where the red-wood and
                  gum-wood both flourish, which will not grow <pb n="797"/> upon the ridges above,*
                  and neither of the three are to be found in the vallies, which, in general, are
                  covered with European plants, and the more common ones of India. </p><p n="1385">Here are a few horses, but they are kept only for the saddle, so that all
                  labour is performed by slaves; nor are they furnished with any of the various
                  machines which art has invented to facilitate their task. The ground is not every
                  where too steep for a cart, and where it is, the wheelbarrow might be used with
                  great advantage, yet there is no wheelbarrow in the whole island; every thing is
                  conveyed from place to place by the slaves, and they are not furnished even with
                  the simple convenience of a porter's knot, but carry their burden upon their
                  heads. They are indeed very numerous, and are brought from almost every part of
                  the world, but they appeared to be a miserable race, worn out partly by excessive
                  labour, and partly by ill usage, of which they frequently complained; and I am
                  sorry to say, that instances of wanton cruelty are much more frequent among my
                  countrymen here, than among the Dutch, who are, and perhaps not without reason,
                  generally reproached with want of humanity at Batavia and the Cape. </p><p n="1386">Among the native products of this island, which are not numerous, must be
                  reckoned ebony, though the trees are now nearly extinct, and are not remembered to
                  have been plenty: pieces of the wood are frequently found in the vallies, of a
                  fine black colour, and a hardness almost equal to iron: these pieces, however, are
                  always so short and crooked, that no use can be made of them. Whether the tree is
                  the same with that which produces ebony upon the isle of Bourbon, or the islands
                  adjacent, is not known, as the French have not yet published any account of it. </p><p n="1387"><pb n="798"/>*There are but few insects in this place, but there is a species of
                  snail found upon the tops of the highest ridges, which probably has been there
                  since the original creation of their kind, at the beginning of the world. It is
                  indeed very difficult to conceive how any thing which was not deposited here at
                  its creation, or brought hither by the diligence of man, could find its way to a
                  place so severed from the rest of the world, by seas of immense extent, except the
                  hypothesis that has been mentioned on another occasion be adopted, and this rock
                  be supposed to have been left behind, when a large tract of country, of which it
                  was part, subsided by some convulsion of nature, and was swallowed up in the
                  ocean. </p><p n="1388">*At one o'clock in the afternoon, of the <date>4th of May</date>, we weighed and stood
                  out of the Road, in company with the Portland man of war, and twelve sail of
                  Indiamen. </p><p n="1389">We continued to sail in company with the fleet, till the <date>10th</date> in the
                  morning,* when, perceiving that we sailed much heavier than any other ship, and
                  thinking it for that reason probable that the Portland would get home before us, I
                  made the signal to speak with her, upon which Captain Elliot himself came on
                  board, and I delivered to him a letter for the Admiralty, with a box, containing
                  the common log books of the ship, and the journals of some of the officers. We
                  continued in company,* however, till the <date>23d</date> in the morning, and then there was
                  not one of the ships in sight. About one o'clock in the afternoon, died our First
                  Lieutenant Mr. Hicks, and in the evening we committed his body to the sea, with
                  the usual ceremonies. The disease of which he died, was a consumption, and as he
                  was not free from it when we sailed from England, it may truly be said that he was
                  dying during <pb n="799"/> the whole voyage,* though his decline was very gradual
                  till we came to Batavia: the next day, I gave Mr. Charles Clerk an order to act as
                  Lieutenant in his room, a young man who was extremely well qualified for that
                  station. </p><p n="1390">Our rigging and sails were now become so bad, that something was giving
                  way every day. We continued our course, however, in safety till the <date>10th of June</date>,
                  when land,* which proved to be the Lizard, was discovered by Nicholas Young, the
                  same boy that first saw New Zealand;* on the <date>11th</date> we run up the channel,* at six
                  in the morning of the <date>12th</date> we passed Beachy Head, at noon we were abreast of
                  Dover, and about three came to an anchor in the Downs, and went ashore at Deal. </p><p n="1391">FINIS. </p></div></div></body></text></TEI>
