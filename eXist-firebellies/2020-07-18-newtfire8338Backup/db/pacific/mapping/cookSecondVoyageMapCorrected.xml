contain another continent, as speculative geography seemed to suggest, was a question which had long
engaged the attention, not only of learned men, but of most of the maritime powers of Europe.</p><p>To put an end to all diversity of opinion about a matter so curious and important, was his
majesty's principal motive in directing this voyage to be undertaken, the history of which is now
submitted to the public.</p><p>But, in order to give the reader a clear idea of what has been done in it, and to enable him to
judge more accurately, how far the great object that was proposed, has been obtained, it will be
necessary to prefix a short account of the several voyages which have been made on discoveries to
the Southern Hemisphere, prior to that which I had lately the honour to conduct, and which I am now
going to relate.</p><p><date>1519 Magalhaens</date>.</p><p>The first who crossed the vast Pacific Ocean, was Ferdinand Magalhaens, a Portuguese, who, in the
service of Spain, sailed from Seville, with five ships, on <date>the 10th of April, 1519</date>. He discovered
the straits which bear his name; and having passed through them, on <date>the 27th of November, 1520</date>,
entered the South Pacific Ocean.</p><p>In this sea he discovered two uninhabited islands, whose situations are not well known. He
afterwards crossed the Line; discovered the Ladrone Islands; and then proceeded to the Phillipines,
in one of which he was killed in a skirmish with the natives.</p><p>His ship, called the Victory, was the first that circumnavigated the globe; and the only one of
his squadron that surmounted the dangers and distresses which attended this heroic enterprise.</p><p>The Spaniards, after Magalhaens had shewed them the way, made several voyages from America to the
westward, previous to that of Alvaro Mendana De Neyra, in 1595, which is the first that can be
traced step by step. For the antecedent expeditions are not handed down to us with much
precision.</p><p>We know, however, in general, that, in them, New Guinea, the islands called Solomon's, and
several others, were discovered. </p><p>Geographers differ greatly concerning the situation of the Solomon Islands. The most probable
opinion is, that they are the cluster which comprises what has since been called New Britain, New
Ireland, &amp;c.</p><p><date>1595 Mendana</date>.</p><p>On <date>the 9th of April, 1595</date>, Mendana, with intention to settle these islands, sailed from Callao,
with four ships; and his discoveries in his route to the west, were the Marquesas, in the latitude
of <geo select="lat">10° S</geo>.; the island of St Bernardo, which I take to be the same that Commodore Byron calls the
Island of Danger; after that, Solitary Island, in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="1">10° 40' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">178° W</geo>.;
and, lastly, Santa Cruz, which is undoubtedly the same that Captain Carteret calls Egmont
Island.</p><p>In this last island, Mendana, with many of his companions, died; and the shattered remains of the
squadron were conducted to Manilla, by Pedro Fernandes de Quiros, the chief pilot.</p><p><date>1605 Quiros</date>.</p><p>This same Quiros was the first sent out, with the sole view of discovering a southern continent,
and, indeed, he seems to have been the first who had any idea of the existence of one.</p><p>He sailed from Callao <date>the 21st of December, 1605</date>, as pilot of the fleet, commanded by Luis Paz de
Torres, consisting of two ships and a tender; and steering to the W.S.W., on the 26th of January,
1606. being then, by their reckoning, a thousand Spanish leagues from the coast of America, they
discovered a small low island in latitude <geo select="lat">26° S</geo>. Two days after, they discovered another that was
high, with a plain on the top. This is probably the same that Captain Carteret calls Pitcairn's
Island.</p><p>After leaving these islands, Quiros seems to have directed his course to W.N.W. and N.W. to 10°
or <geo select="lat">11° S</geo>. latitude, and then westward, till he arrived at the Bay of St Philip and Jago, in the
Island of Tierra del Espirito Santo. In this route be discovered several islands; probably some of
those that have been seen by later navigators.</p><p>On leaving the bay of St Philip and St Jago, the two ships were separated. Quiros, with the
Capitana, stood to the north, and returned to New Spain, after having suffered greatly for want of
provisions and water. Torres, with the Almiranta and the tender, steered to the west, and seems to
have been the first who sailed between New Holland and New Guinea.</p><p>1615. Le Maire and Schouten</p><p>The next attempt to make discoveries in the South Pacific Ocean, was conducted by Le Maire and
Schouten. They sailed from the Texel, on <date>the 14th of June, 1615</date>, with the ships Concord and Horn.
The latter was burnt by accident in Port Desire. With the other they discovered the straits that
bear the name of Le Maire, and were the first who ever entered the Pacific Ocean, by the way of Cape
Horn.</p><p>They discovered the island of Dogs, in latitude <geo select="lat" n="1">15° 15' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">136° 30' W</geo>.; Sondre Grondt
in <geo select="lat" n="2">15° S</geo>. latitude, and <geo select="lon" n="2">143° 10' W</geo>. longitude; Waterland in <geo select="lat" n="3">14° 46' S</geo>., and <geo select="lon" n="3">144° 10' W</geo>.; and
twenty-five leagues westward of this, Fly Island, in latitude <geo select="lat">15° 20' S</geo>; Traitor's and Coco's Islands,
in latitude <geo select="lat" n="4">15° 43' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="4">173° 13' W</geo>.; two degrees more to the westward, the isle of Hope;
and in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="5">14° 56' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="5">179° 30' E</geo>., Horn Island.</p><p>They next coasted the north side of New Britain and New Guinea, and arrived at Batavia in
<date>October, 1616</date>.</p><p><date>1642 Tasman</date>.</p><p>Except some discoveries on the western and northern coasts of New Holland, no important voyage to
the Pacific Ocean was undertaken till 1642, when Captain Tasman sailed from Batavia, with two ships
belonging to the Dutch East India Company, and discovered Van Diemen's Land; a small part of the
western coast of New Zealand; the Friendly Isles; and those called Prince William's.</p><p><date>1594 Sir</date> Richard Hawkins.</p><p>Thus far I have thought it best not to interrupt the progress of discovery in the South Pacific
Ocean, otherwise I should before have mentioned, that Sir Richard Hawkins in 1594, being about fifty
leagues to the eastward of the river Plate, was driven by a storm to the eastward of his intended
course, and when the weather grew moderate, steering towards the Straits of Magalhaens, he
unexpectedly fell in with land, about sixty leagues of which he coasted, and has very particularly
described. This he named Hawkins's Maiden Land, in honour of his royal mistress, Queen Elizabeth,
and says it lies some threescore leagues from the nearest part of South America.</p><p><date>1689 Strong</date>.</p><p>This land was afterwards discovered to be two large islands, by Captain John Strong, of the
Farewell, from London, who, in 1689, passed through the strait which divides the eastern from the
western of those islands. To this strait he gave the name of Falkland's Sound, in honour of his
patron Lord Falkland; and the name has since been extended, through inadvertency, to the two islands
it separates.</p><p>Having mentioned these islands, I will add, that future navigators will mis-spend their time, if
they look for Pepy's Island in <geo select="lat">47° S</geo>.; it being now certain, that Pepy's Island is no other than
these islands of Falkland.</p><p><date>1675 La</date> Roche.</p><p>In <date>April, 1675</date>, Anthony la Roche, an English merchant, in his return from the South Pacific
Ocean, where he had been on a trading voyage, being carried by the winds and currents, far to the
east of Strait Le Maire, fell in with a coast, which may possibly be the same with that which I
visited during this voyage, and have called the Island of Georgia.</p><p>Leaving this land, and sailing to the north, La Roche, in the latitude of <geo select="lat">45° S</geo>., discovered a
large island, with a good port towards the eastern part, where he found wood, water, and fish.</p><p><date>1699 Halley</date>.</p><p>In 1699, that celebrated astronomer, Dr Edmund Halley, was appointed to the command of his
majesty's ship the Paramour Pink, on an expedition for improving the knowledge of the longitude, and
of the variation of the compass; and for discovering the unknown lands supposed to lie in the
southern part of the Atlantic Ocean. In this voyage he determined the longitude of several places;
and, after his return, constructed his variation-chart, and proposed a method of observing the
longitude at sea, by means of the appulses and occultations of the fixed stars. But, though he so
successfully attended to the two first articles of his instructions, he did not find any unknown
southern land.</p><p><date>1721 Roggewein</date>.</p><p>The Dutch, in 1721, fitted out three ships to make discoveries in the South Pacific Ocean, under
the command of Admiral Roggewein. He left the Texel on the 21st of August, and arriving in that
ocean, by going round Cape Horn, discovered Easter Island, probably seen before, though not visited,
by Davis;* then between 14° 41' and <geo select="lat">15° 47' S</geo>. latitude, and between the longitude of 142° and 150°
W., fell in with several other islands, which I take to be some of those seen by the late English
navigators. He next discovered two islands in latitude <geo select="lat" n="1">15° S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">170° W</geo>., which he called
Baumen's Islands; and, lastly, Single Island, in latitude <geo select="lat" n="2">13° 41' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="2">171° 30' W</geo>. These
three islands are, undoubtedly, the same that Bougainville calls the Isles of Navigators.</p><p>[* See Waser's description of the Isthmus of Darien.]</p><p><date>1738 Bouvet</date>.</p><p>In 1738, the French East India Company sent Lozier Bouvet with two ships, the Eagle and Mary, to
make discoveries in the South Atlantic Ocean. He sailed from Port L'Orient on the 19th of July in
that year; touched at the island of St Catherine; and from thence shaped his course towards the
south-east.</p><p>On <date>the 1st of January, 1739</date>, he discovered land, or what he judged to be land, in latitude <geo select="lat" n="1">54°
S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">11° E</geo>. It will appear in the course of the following narrative, that we made several
attempts to find this land without success. It is, therefore, very probable, that what Bouvet saw
was nothing more than a large ice-island. From hence he stood to the east, in <geo select="lat">51° S</geo> of latitude to<geo select="lat">35° E</geo> 
of E. longitude: After which the two ships separated, one going to the island of Mauritius, and the
other returning to France.</p><p>After this voyage of Bouvet, the spirit of discovery ceased, till his present majesty formed a
design of making discoveries, and exploring the southern hemisphere; and, in the year 1764, directed
it to be put in execution.</p><p><date>1764 Byron</date>.</p><p>Accordingly Commodore Byron, having under his command the Dolphin and Tamer, sailed from the
Downs on the 21st of June the same year; and having visited the Falkland Islands, passed through the
Straits of Magalhaens into the Pacific Ocean, where he discovered the islands of Disappointment,
George's, Prince of Wales's, the isles of Danger, York Island, and Byron Island.</p><p><date>1766 Wallis</date>.</p><p>He returned to England <date>the 9th of May, 1766</date>, and, in the month of August following, the Dolphin
was again sent out under the command of Captain Wallis, with the Swallow, commanded by Captain
Carteret.</p><p>They proceeded together, till they came to the west end of the Straits of Magalhaens, and the
Great South Sea in sight, where they were separated. </p><p>Captain Wallis directed his course more westerly than any navigator had done before him in so
high a latitude; but met with no land till he got within the tropic, where he discovered the islands
of Whitsunday, Queen Charlotte, Egmont, Duke of Gloucester, Duke of Cumberland, Maitea, Otaheite,
Eimeo, Tapamanou, How, Scilly, Boscawen, Keppel, and Wallis; and returned to England in May,
1768.</p><p>Carteret.</p><p>His companion Captain Carteret kept a different route, in which he discovered the islands of
Osnaburg, Gloucester, Queen Charlotte's Isles, Carteret's, Gower's, and the strait between New
Britain and New Ireland; and returned to England in <date>March, 1769</date>.</p><p><date>1766 Bougainville</date>.</p><p>In <date>November, 1766</date>, Commodore Bougainville sailed from France in the frigate La Boudeuse, with the
store-ship L'Etoile. After spending some time on the coast of Brazil, and at Falkland's Islands, he
got into the Pacific Sea by the Straits of Magalhaens, in <date>January, 1768</date>.</p><p>In this ocean he discovered the Four Facardines, the isle of Lanciers, and Harp Island, which I
take to be the same that I afterwards named Lagoon, Thrum Cap, and Bow Island. About twenty leagues
farther to the west he discovered four other islands; afterwards fell in with Maitea, Otaheite,
isles of Navigators, and Forlorn Hope, which to him were new discoveries. He then passed through
between the Hebrides, discovered the Shoal of Diana, and some others, the land of Cape Deliverance,
several islands more to the north, passed the north of New Ireland, touched at Batavia, and arrived
in France in <date>March, 1769</date>.</p><p>This year was rendered remarkable by the transit of the planet Venus over the sun's disk, a
phenomenon of great importance to astronomy; and which every-where engaged the attention of the
learned in that science.</p><p>In the beginning of the 1768, the Royal Society presented a memorial to his majesty, setting
forth the advantages to be derived from accurate observations of this transit in different parts of
the world; particularly from a set of such observations made in a southern latitude, between the
140th and 130th degrees of longitude, west from the Royal Observatory at Greenwich; and that
vessels, properly equipped, would be necessary to convey the observers to their destined stations;
but that the society were in no condition to defray the expence of such an undertaking.</p><p>In consequence of this memorial, the Admiralty were directed by his majesty to provide proper
vessels for this purpose. Accordingly, the Endeavour bark, which had been built for the coal-trade,
was purchased and fitted out for the southern voyage, and I was honoured with the command of her.
The Royal Society, soon after, appointed me, in conjunction with Mr Charles Green the astronomer, to
make the requisite observations on the transit.</p><p>It was at first intended to perform this great, and now a principal business of our voyage,
either at the Marquesas, or else at one of those islands which Tasman had called Amsterdam,
Rotterdam, and Middleburg, now better known under the name of the Friendly Islands. But while the
Endeavour was getting ready for the expedition, Captain Wallis returned from his voyage round the
world, in the course of which he had discovered several islands in the South Sea; and, amongst
others, Otaheite. This island was preferred to any of those before mentioned, on account of the
conveniences it afforded; because its place had been well ascertained, and found to be extremely
well suited to our purpose.</p><p>I was therefore ordered to proceed directly to Otaheite; and after astronomical observations
should be completed, to prosecute the design of making discoveries in the South Pacific Ocean, by
proceeding to the south as far as the latitude of<geo select="lat">40° S</geo> ; then, if I found no land, to proceed to the
west between 40° and 35°, till I fell in with New Zealand, which I was to explore; and thence to
return to England by such route as I should think proper.</p><p><date>1768 Cook</date>'s first voyage.</p><p>In the prosecution of these instructions, I sailed from Deptford the 30th <date>July, 1768</date>; from
Plymouth the 26th of August, touched at Madeira, Rio de Janeiro, and Straits Le Maire, and entered
the South Pacific Ocean by Cape Horn in January the following year. </p><p>I endeavoured to make a direct course to Otaheite, and in part succeeded; but I made no discovery
till I got within the tropic, where I fell in with Lagoon Island, Two Groups, Bird Island, Chain
Island; and on the 13th of April arrived at Otaheite, where I remained three months, during which
time the observations on the transit were made.</p><p>I then left it; discovered and visited the Society Isles and Oheteroa; thence proceeded to the
south till I arrived in the latitude of <geo select="lat">40° 22' S</geo> , longitude <geo select="lon">147° 29' W</geo>.; and, on the 6th of October,
fell in with the east side of New Zealand.</p><p>I continued exploring the coast of this country till <date>the 31st of March, 1770</date>, when I quitted it,
and proceeded to New Holland; and having surveyed the eastern coast of that vast country, which part
had not before been visited, I passed between its northern extremity and New Guinea, landed on the
latter, touched at the island of Savu, Batavia, the Cape of Good Hope, and St Helena,* and arrived
in England on <date>the 12th of July, 1771</date>.</p><p>[* In the account given of St Helena in the narrative of my former voyage, I find two mistakes.
Its inhabitants are far from exercising a wanton cruelty over their slaves, and they have had
wheel-carriages and porters' knots for many years.]</p><p>In this voyage I was accompanied by Mr Banks and Dr Solander; the first a gentleman of ample
fortune; the other an accomplished disciple of Linnæus, and one of the librarians of the British
Museum; both of them distinguished in the learned world, for their extensive and accurate knowledge
of natural history. These gentlemen, animated by the love of science, and by a desire to pursue
their enquiries in the remote regions I was preparing to visit, desired permission to make a voyage
with me. The Admiralty readily complied with a request that promised such advantage to the republic
of letters. They accordingly embarked with me, and participated in all the dangers and sufferings of
our tedious and fatiguing navigation.</p><p>The voyages of Messrs de Surville, Kerguelen, and Marion, of which some account is given in the
following work, did not come to my knowledge time enough to afford me any advantage; and as they
have not been communicated to the world in a public way, I can say little about them, or about two
other voyages, which, I am told, have been made by the Spaniards; one to Easter Island in the year
1769, and the other to Otaheite in 1775.</p><p>Before I begin my narrative of the expedition entrusted to my care, it will be necessary to add
here some account of its equipment, and of some other matters equally interesting, connected with my
subject.</p><p>Soon after my return home in the Endeavour, it was resolved to equip two ships, to complete the
discovery of the Southern Hemisphere. The nature of this voyage required ships of a particular
construction, and the Endeavour being gone to Falkland's Isles as a store-ship, the Navy-board was
directed to purchase two such ships as were most suitable for this service.</p><p>At this time various opinions were espoused by different people, touching the size and kind of
vessels most proper for such a voyage. Some were for having large ships, and proposed those of forty
guns, or East India Company's ships. Others preferred large good sailing frigates, or three- decked
ships, employed in the Jamaica trade, fitted with round-houses. But of all that was said and offered
to the Admiralty's consideration on this subject, as far as has come to my knowledge, what, in my
opinion, was most to the purpose, was suggested by the Navy-board.</p><p>As the kind of ships most proper to be employed on discoveries, is a very interesting
consideration to the adventurers in such undertakings, it may possibly be of use to those, who, in
future, may be so employed, to give here the purport of the sentiments of the Navy-board thereon,
with whom, after the experience of two voyages of three years each, I perfectly agree.</p><p>The success of such undertakings as making discoveries in distant parts of the world, will
principally depend on the preparations being well adapted to what ought to be the first
considerations, namely, the preservation of the adventurers and ships; and this will ever chiefly
depend on the kind, the size, and the properties of the ships chosen for the service.</p><p>These primary considerations will not admit of any other that may interfere with the necessary
properties of the ships. Therefore, in choosing the ships, should any of the most advantageous
properties be wanting, and the necessary room in them, be in any degree diminished, for less
important purposes, such a step would be laying a foundation for rendering the undertaking abortive
in the first instance.</p><p>As the greatest danger to be apprehended and provided against, on a voyage of discovery,
especially to the most distant parts of the globe, is that of the ship's being liable to be run
a-ground on an unknown, desert, or perhaps savage coast; so no consideration should be set in
competition with that of her being of a construction of the safest kind, in which the officers may,
with the least hazard, venture upon a strange coast. A ship of this kind must not be of a great
draught of water, yet of a sufficient burden and capacity to carry a proper quantity of provisions
and necessaries for her complement of men, and for the time requisite to perform the voyage.</p><p>She must also be of a construction that will bear to take the ground; and of a size, which in
case of necessity, may be safely and conveniently laid on shore, to repair any accidental damage or
defect. These properties are not to be found in ships of war of forty guns, nor in frigates, nor in
East India Company's ships, nor in large three-decked West India ships, nor indeed in any other but
North-country-built ships, or such as are built for the coal-trade, which are peculiarly adapted to
this purpose.</p><p>In such a vessel an able sea-officer will be most venturesome, and better enabled to fulfil his
instructions, than he possibly can (or indeed than would be prudent for him to attempt) in one of
any other <emph rend="italic">sort</emph> or <emph rend="italic">size</emph>.</p><p>Upon the whole, I am firmly of opinion, that no ships are so proper for discoveries in distant
unknown parts, as those constructed as was the Endeavour, in which I performed my former voyage. For
no ships of any other kind can contain stores and provisions sufficient (in proportion to the
necessary number of men,) considering the length of time it will be necessary they should last. And,
even if another kind of ships could stow a sufficiency, yet on arriving at the parts for discovery,
they would still, from the nature of their construction and size, be <emph rend="italic">less
fit</emph> for the purpose.</p><p>Hence, it may be concluded, so little progress had been hitherto made in discoveries in the
Southern Hemisphere. For all ships which attempted it before the Endeavour, were unfit for it;
although the officers employed in them had done the utmost in their power.</p><p>It was upon this consideration that the Endeavour was chosen for that voyage. It was to those
properties in her that those on board owed their preservation; and hence we were enabled to
prosecute discoveries in those seas so much longer than any other ship ever did, or could do. And,
although discovery was not the first object of that voyage, I could venture to traverse a far
greater space of sea, til then unnavigated; to discover greater tracts of country in high and low
south latitudes, and to persevere longer in exploring and surveying more correctly the extensive
coasts of those new-discovered countries, than any former navigator perhaps had done during one
voyage.</p><p>In short, these properties in the ships, with perseverance and resolution in their commanders,
will enable them to execute their orders; to go beyond former discoverers; and continue to Britain
the reputation of taking the lead of nations, in exploring the globe.</p><p>These considerations concurring with Lord Sandwich's opinion on the same subject, the Admiralty
determined to have two such ships as are here recommended. Accordingly two were purchased of Captain
William Hammond of Hull. They were both built at Whitby, by the same person who built the Endeavour,
being about fourteen or sixteen months old at the time they were purchased, and were, in my opinion,
as well adapted to the intended service, as if they had been built for the purpose. The largest of
the two was four hundred and sixty-two tons burden. She was named Resolution, and sent to Deptford
to be equipped. The other was three hundred and thirty-six tons burden. She was named Adventure, and
sent to be equipped at Woolwich.</p><p>It was at first proposed to sheathe them with copper; but on considering that copper corrodes the
iron-work, especially about the rudder, this intention was laid aside, and the old method of
sheathing and fitting pursued, as being the most secure; for although it is usual to make the
rudder-bands of the same composition, it is not, however, so durable as iron, nor would it, I am
well assured, last out such a voyage as the Resolution performed.</p><p>Therefore, till a remedy is found to prevent the effect of copper upon iron-work, it would not be
advisable to use it on a voyage of this kind, as, the principal fastenings of the ship being iron,
they may be destroyed.</p><p>On <date>the 28th of November, 1771</date>, I was appointed to the command of the Resolution; and Tobias
Furneaux (who had been second lieutenant with Captain Wallis) was promoted, on this occasion, to the
command of the Adventure. </p><p><emph rend="italic">Our Complements of Officers and Men were fixed, as in the following

The
second and third lieutenants, the lieutenant of marines, two of the warrant officers, and several of
the petty officers, had been with me during the former voyage. The others were men of known
abilities; and all of them, on every occasion, shewed their zeal for the service in which they were
employed, during the whole voyage.</p><p>In the equipping of these ships, they were not confined to ordinary establishments, but were
fitted in the most complete manner, and supplied with every extra article that was suggested to be
necessary.</p><p>Lord Sandwich paid an extraordinary attention to this equipment, by visiting the ships from time
to time, to satisfy himself that the whole was completed to his wish, and to the satisfaction of
those who were to embark in them.</p><p>Nor were the Navy and Victualling Boards wanting in providing them with the very best of stores
and provisions, and whatever else was necessary for so long a voyage.—Some alterations were adopted
in the species of provisions usually made use of in the navy. That is, we were supplied with wheat
in lieu of so much oatmeal, and sugar in lieu of so much oil; and when completed, each ship had two
years and a half provisions on board, of all species.</p><p>We had besides many extra articles, such as <emph rend="italic">malt, sour krout, salted cabbage,
portable broth, saloup, mustard, marmalade of carrots, and inspissated juice of wort and
beer</emph>. Some of these articles had before been found to be highly antiscorbutic; and others
were now sent out on trial, or by way of experiment;—the inspissated juice of beer and wort, and
marmalade of carrots especially. As several of these antiscorbutic articles are not generally known,
a more particular account of them may not be amiss.</p><p>Of <emph rend="italic">malt</emph> is made <emph rend="italic">sweet wort</emph>, which is given
to such persons as have got the scurvy, or whose habit of body threatens them with it, from one to
five or six pints a-day, as the surgeon sees necessary.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Sour krout</emph> is cabbage cut small, to which is put a little salt, juniper
berries, and anniseeds; it is then fermented, and afterwards close packed in casks; in which state
it will keep good a long time. This is a wholesome vegetable food, and a great antiscorbutic. The
allowance to each man is two pounds a week, but I increased or diminished their allowance as I
thought proper.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Salted cabbage</emph> is cabbage cut to pieces, and salted down in casks, which
will preserve it a long time.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Portable broth</emph> is so well known, that it needs no description. We were
supplied with it both for the sick and well, and it was exceedingly beneficial.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Saloup</emph> and <emph rend="italic">rob of lemons</emph> and <emph rend="italic">oranges</emph> were for the sick and scorbutic only, and wholly under the surgeon's
care.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Marmalade of carrots</emph> is the juice of yellow carrots, inspissated till it
is of the thickness of fluid honey, or treacle, which last it resembles both in taste and colour. It
was recommended by Baron Storsch, of Berlin, as a very great antiscorbutic; but we did not find that
it had much of this quality.</p><p>For the <emph rend="italic">inspissated juice of wort</emph> and <emph rend="italic">beer</emph>
we were indebted to Mr Pelham, secretary to the commissioners of the victualling office. This
gentleman, some years ago, considered that if the juice of malt, either as beer or wort, was
inspissated by evaporation, it was probable this inspissated juice would keep good at sea; and, if
so, a supply of beer might be had, at any time, by mixing it with water. Mr Pelham made several
experiments, which succeeded so well, that the commissioners caused thirty- one half barrels of this
juice to be prepared, and sent out with our ships for trial; nineteen on board the Resolution, and
the remainder on board the Adventure. The success of the experiments will be mentioned in the
narrative, in the order as they were made.</p><p>The frame of a small vessel, twenty tons burthen, was properly prepared, and put on board each of
the ships to be set up (if found necessary) to serve as tenders upon any emergency, or to transport
the crew, in case the ship was lost.</p><p>We were also well provided with fishing-nets, lines, and hooks of every kind for catching of
fish.—And, in order to enable us to procure refreshments, in such inhabited parts of the world as we
might touch at, where money was of no value, the Admiralty caused to be put on board both the ships,
several articles of merchandize; as well to trade with the natives for provisions, as to make them
presents to gain their friendship and esteem.</p><p>Their lordships also caused a number of medals to be struck, the one side representing his
majesty, and the other the two ships. These medals were to be given to the natives of new-discovered
countries, and left there as testimonies of our being the first discoverers.</p><p>Some additional clothing, adapted to a cold climate, was put on board; to be given to the seamen
whenever it was thought necessary. In short, nothing was wanting that could tend to promote the
success of the undertaking, or contribute to the conveniences and health of those who embarked in
it.</p><p>The Admiralty shewed no less attention to science in general, by engaging Mr William Hodges, a
landscape painter, to embark in this voyage, in order to make drawings and paintings of such places
in the countries we should touch at, as might be proper to give a more perfect, idea thereof, than
could be formed from written descriptions only.</p><p>And it being thought of public utility, that some person skilled in natural history, should be
engaged to accompany me in this voyage, the parliament granted an ample sum for the purpose, and Mr
John Reinhold Forster, with his son, were pitched upon for this employment.</p><p>The Board of Longitude agreed with Mr William Wales and Mr William Bayley, to make astronomical
observations; the former on board the Resolution, and the latter on board the Adventure. The great
improvements which astronomy and navigation have met with from the many interesting observations
they have made, would have done honour to any person whose reputation for mathematical knowledge was
not so well known as theirs.</p><p>The same Board furnished them with the best instruments, for making both astronomical and
nautical observations and experiments; and likewise with four time-pieces, or watch machines; three
made by Mr Arnold, and one made by Mr Kendal on Mr Harrison's principles. A particular account of
the going of these watches, as also the astronomical and nautical observations made by the
astronomers, has been before the public, by order of the Board of Longitude, under the inspection of
Mr Wales.</p><p>Besides the obligation I was under to this gentleman for communicating to me the observations he
made, from time to time, during the voyage, I have since been indebted to him for the perusal of his
journal, with leave to take from it whatever I thought might contribute to the improvement of this
work.</p><p>For the convenience of the generality of readers, I have reduced the time from the nautical to
the civil computation, so that whenever the terms A.M. and P.M. are used, the former signifies the
<time>forenoon</time>, and the latter the <time>afternoon</time> of the same day.</p><p>In all the courses, bearings, &amp;c., the variation of the compass is allowed, unless the
contrary is expressed. And now it may be necessary to say, that, as I am on the point of sailing on
a third expedition, I leave this account of my last voyage in the hands of some friends, who, in my
absence, have kindly accepted the office of correcting the press for me; who are pleased to think
that what I have here to relate is better to be given in my own words, than in the words of another
person; especially as it is a work designed for information, and not merely for amusement; in which,
it is their opinion, that candour and fidelity will counter-balance the want of ornament.</p><p>I shall therefore conclude this introductory discourse with desiring the reader to excuse the
inaccuracies of style, which doubtless he will frequently meet with in the following narrative; and
that, when such occur, he will recollect that it is the production of a man, who has not had the
advantage of much school education, but who has been constantly at sea from his youth; and though,
with the assistance of a few good friends, he has passed through all the stations belonging to a
seaman, from an apprentice boy in the coal trade, to a post-captain in the royal navy, he has had no
opportunity of cultivating letters. After this account of myself, the public must not expect from me
the elegance of a fine writer, or the plausibility of a professed book-maker; but will, I hope,
consider me as a plain man, zealously exerting himself in the service of his country, and determined
to give the best account he is able of his proceedings.</p><p>JAMES COOK.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Plymouth Sound, <date>July 7, 1776</date>.</emph></p><p>******************</p><list type="simple"><item>LIST OF THE PLATES</item><item/><item>With directions for placing them.</item><item/><item>[As the Plates, for the sake of expedition, were printed off as fast as they were finished, it

by easterly winds till the 23d, when the ship fell down to Long Reach, and the next day was joined
by the Adventure. Here both ships received on board their powder, guns, gunners' stores, and
marines.</p><p><date>1772 May</date></p><p>On the 10th of May we left Long Reach, with orders to touch at Plymouth; but in plying down the
river, the Resolution was found to be very crank, which made it necessary to put into Sheerness in
order to remove this evil, by making some alteration in her upper works. These the officers of the
yard were ordered to take in hand immediately; and Lord Sandwich and Sir Hugh Palliser came down to
see them executed in such a manner as might effectually answer the purpose intended.</p><p><date>1772 June</date></p><p>On the 22d of June the ship was again completed for sea, when I sailed from Sheerness; and on the
3d of July joined the Adventure in Plymouth Sound. The evening before, we met, off the Sound, Lord
Sandwich, in the Augusta yacht, (who was on his return from visiting the several dock-yards,) with
the Glory frigate and Hazard sloop. We saluted his lordship with seventeen guns; and soon after he
and Sir Hugh Palliser gave us the last mark of the very great attention they had paid to this
equipment, by coming on board, to satisfy themselves that every thing was done to my wish, and that
the ship was found to answer to my satisfaction.</p><p>At Plymouth I received my instructions, dated the 25th of June, directing me to take under my
command the Adventure; to make the best of my way to the island of Madeira, there to take in a
supply of wine, and then proceed to the Cape of Good Hope, where I was to refresh the ships'
companies, and to take on board such provisions and necessaries as I might stand in need of. After
leaving the Cape of Good Hope, I was to proceed to the southward, and endeavour to fall in with Cape
Circumcision, which was said by Monsieur Bouvet to lie in the latitude of <geo select="lat">54° S</geo>. and in about 11°
20' E. longitude from Greenwich. If I discovered this cape, I was to satisfy myself whether it was a
part of the continent which had so much engaged the attention of geographers and former navigators,
or a part of an island. If it proved to be the former, I was to employ myself diligently in
exploring as great an extent of it as I could, and to make such notations thereon, and observations
of every kind, as might be useful either to navigation or commerce, or tend to the promotion of
natural knowledge. I was also directed to observe the genius, temper, disposition, and number of the
inhabitants, if there were any, and endeavour, by all proper means, to cultivate a friendship and
alliance with them; making them presents of such things as they might value; inviting them to
traffic, and shewing them every kind of civility and regard. I was to continue to employ myself on
this service, and making discoveries either to the eastward or westward, as my situation might
render most eligible; keeping in as high a latitude as I could, and prosecuting my discoveries as
near to the South Pole as possible, so long as the condition of the ships, the health of their
crews, and the state of their provisions, would admit of; taking care to reserve as much of the
latter as would enable me to reach some known port, where I was to procure a sufficiency to bring me
home to England. But if Cape Circumcision should prove to be part of an island only, or if I should
not be able to find the said Cape, I was in the first case to make the necessary survey of the
island, and then to stand on to the southward, so long as I judged there was a likelihood of falling
in with the continent, which I was also to do in the latter case, and then to proceed to the
eastward in further search of the said continent, as well as to make discoveries of such islands as
might be situated in that unexplored part of the southern hemisphere; keeping in high latitudes, and
prosecuting my discoveries, as above mentioned, as near the pole as possible until I had
circumnavigated the globe; after which I was to proceed to the Cape of Good Hope, and from thence to
Spithead.</p><p>In the prosecution of these discoveries, wherever the season of the year rendered it unsafe for
me to continue in high latitudes, I was to retire to some known place to the northward, to refresh
my people, and refit the ships; and to return again to the southward as soon as the season of the
year would admit of it. In all unforeseen cases, I was authorised to proceed according to my own
discretion; and in case the Resolution should be lost or disabled, I was to prosecute the voyage on
board the Adventure.</p><p>I gave a copy of these instructions to Captain Furneaux, with an order directing him to carry
them into execution; and, in case he was separated from me, appointed the island of Madeira for the
first place of rendezvous; Port Praya in the island of St Jago for the second; Cape of Good Hope for
the third; and New Zealand for the fourth.</p><p>During our stay at Plymouth, Messrs Wales and Bayley, the two astronomers, made observations on
Drake's Island, in order to ascertain the latitude, longitude, and true time for putting the
time-pieces and watches in motion. The latitude was found to be <geo select="lat">50° 21' 30" N</geo>., and the longitude <geo select="lon">4°
20' W</geo>. of Greenwich, which, in this voyage, is every where to be understood as the first meridian,
and from which the longitude is reckoned east and west to <geo select="lon">180° E</geo>ach way.</p><p><date>1772 July</date></p><p>On the 10th of July the watches were set a-going in the presence of the two astronomers, Captain
Furneaux, the first lieutenants of the ships, and myself, and put on board. The two on board the
Adventure were made by Mr Arnold, and also one of those on board the Resolution; but the other was
made by Mr Kendal, upon the same principle, in every respect, as Mr Harrison's time-piece. The
commander, first lieutenant, and astronomer, on board each, of the ships, kept each of them keys of
the boxes which contained the watches, and were always to be present at the winding them up, and
comparing the one with the other; or some other officer, if at any time, through indisposition, or
absence upon any other necessary duties, any of them could not conveniently attend. The same day,
according to the custom of the navy, the companies of both ships were paid two months wages in
advance, and, as a further encouragement for their going this extraordinary voyage, they were also
paid the wages due to them to the 28th of the preceding May. This enabled them to provide
necessaries for the voyage.</p><p>On the 13th, at <time>six o'clock  in the morning</time>, I sailed from Plymouth Sound, with the Adventure in
company; and on the evening of the 29th anchored in Funchiale Road, in the island of Madeira. The
next morning I saluted the garrison with eleven guns; which compliment was immediately returned.
Soon after I went on shore, accompanied by Captain Furneaux, the two Mr Forsters, and Mr Wales. At
our landing, we were received by a gentleman from the vice-consul, Mr Sills, who conducted us to the
house of Mr Loughnans, the most considerable English merchant in the place. This gentleman not only
obtained leave for Mr Forster to search the island for plants, but procured us every other thing we
wanted, and insisted on our accommodating ourselves at his house during our stay.</p><p>The town of Funchiale, which is the capital of the island, is situated about the middle of the
south side, in the bottom of the bay of the same name, in latitude <geo select="lat">32° 33' 34" N</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">17°
12-7/8" W</geo>. The longitude was deduced from lunar observations made by Mr Wales, and reduced to the
town by Mr Kendal's watch, which made the longitude <geo select="lon">17° 10' 14" W</geo>. During our stay here, the crews
of both ships were supplied with fresh beef and onions; and a quantity of the latter was distributed
amongst them for a sea-store.</p><p><date>1772 August</date></p><p>Having got on board a supply of water, wine, and other necessaries, we left Madeira on the 1st of
August, and stood to the southward with a fine gale at N.E. On the 4th we passed Palma, one of the
Canary isles. It is of a height to be seen twelve or fourteen leagues, and lies in the latitude <geo select="lat">28°
38' N</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">17° 58' W</geo>. The next day we saw the isle of Ferro, and passed it at the distance of
fourteen leagues. I judged it to lie in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="1">27° 42' N</geo>. and longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">18° 9' W</geo>.</p><p>I now made three puncheons of beer of the inspissated juice of malt. The proportion I made use of
was about ten of water to one of juice. Fifteen of the nineteen half barrels of the inspissated
juice which we had on board, were produced from wort that was hopped before inspissated. The other
four were made of beer that had been both hopped and fermented before inspissated. This last
requires no other preparation to make it fit for use, than to mix it with cold water, from one part
in eight to one part in twelve of water, (or in such other proportion as might be liked,) then stop
it down, and in a few days it will be brisk and drinkable. But the other sort, after being mixed
with water in the same manner, will require to be fermented with yeast, in the usual way of making
beer; at least it was so thought. However, experience taught us that this will not always be
necessary: For by the heat of the weather, and the agitation of the ship, both sorts were at this
time in the highest state of fermentation, and had hitherto evaded all our endeavours to stop it. If
this juice could be kept from fermenting, it certainly would be a most valuable article at sea.</p><p>On finding that our stock of water would not last as to the Cape of Good Hope, without putting
the people to a scanty allowance, I resolved to stop at St Jago for a supply. On the <date>9th</date>, at <time>nine
o'clock in the morning</time>, we made the island of Bonavista, bearing S.W. The next day, we passed the
isle of Mayo on our right; and the same evening anchored in Port Praya in the island of St Jago, in
eighteen fathom water. The east point of the bay bore E.; the west point S.W. 1/2 S.; and the fort
N.W. I immediately dispatched an officer to ask leave to water, and purchase refreshments, which was
granted. On the return of the officer, I saluted the fort with eleven guns, on a promise of its
being returned with an equal number. But by a mistake, as they pretended, the salute was returned
with only nine; for which the governor made an excuse the next day. The 14th, in the evening, having
completed our water, and got on board a supply of refreshments, such as hogs, goats, fowls, and
fruit, we put to sea, and proceeded on our voyage.</p><p>Port Praya is a small bay, situated about the middle of the south side of the island of St Jago,
in the latitude of <geo select="lat">14° 53' 30" N</geo>. longitude <geo select="lon">23° 30' W</geo>. It may be known, especially in coming from
the east, by the southernmost hill on the island, which is round, and peaked at top; and lies a
little way inland, in the direction of west from the port. This mark is the more necessary, as there
is a small cove about a league to the eastward, with a sandy beach in the bottom of it, a valley,
and cocoa-nut trees behind, which strangers may mistake for Port Praya, as we ourselves did. The two
points which form the entrance of Port Praya Bay are rather low, and in the direction of W.S.W. and
E.N.E. half a league from each other. Close to the west point are sunken rocks, on which the sea
continually breaks. The bay lies in N.W. near half a league; and the depth of water is from fourteen
to four fathoms. Large ships ought not to anchor in less than eight, in which depth the south end of
the Green Island (a small island lying under the west shore) will bear W. You water at a well that
is behind the beach at the head of the bay. The water is tolerable, but scarce; and bad getting off,
on account of a great surf on the beach. The refreshments to be got here, are bullocks, hogs, goats,
sheep, poultry, and fruits. The goats are of the antelope kind, so extraordinarily lean, that hardly
any thing can equal them; and the bullocks, hogs, and sheep, are not much better. Bullocks must be
purchased with money; the price is twelve Spanish dollars a-head, weighing between 250 and 300
pounds. Other articles may be got from the natives in exchange for old clothes, &amp;c. But the sale
of bullocks is confined to a company of merchants; to whom this privilege is granted, and who keep
an agent residing upon the spot. The fort above mentioned seems wholly designed for the protection
of the bay, and is well situated for that purpose, being built on an elevation, which rises directly
from the sea on the right, at the head of the bay.</p><p>We had no sooner got clear of Port Praya, than we got a fresh gale at N.N.E. which blew in
squalls, attended with showers of rain. But the next day the wind and showers abated, and veered to
the S. It was, however, variable and unsettled for several days, accompanied with dark gloomy
weather, and showers of rain.</p><p>On the 19th, in the <time>afternoon</time>, one of the carpenter's mates fell overboard, and was drowned. He
was over the side, fitting in one of the scuttles, from whence it is supposed he had fallen; for he
was not seen till the very instant he sunk under the ship's stern, when our endeavours to save him
were too late. This loss was sensibly felt during the voyage, as he was a sober man and a good
workman. About <time>noon</time> the next day, the rain poured down upon us, not in drops but in streams. The
wind, at the same time, was variable and squally, which obliged the people to attend the decks, so
that few in the ships escaped a good soaking. We, however, benefited by it, as it gave us an
opportunity of filling all our empty water-casks. This heavy rain at last brought on a dead calm,
which continued twenty-four hours, when it was succeeded by a breeze from S.W. Betwixt this point
and S. it continued for several days; and blew at times in squalls, attended with rain and hot
sultry weather. The mercury in the thermometers at <time>noon</time>, kept generally from 79 to 82.</p><p>On the 27th, spoke with Captain Furneaux, who informed us that one of his petty officers was
dead. At this time <emph rend="italic">we</emph> had not one sick on board, although we had every
thing of this kind to fear from the rain we had had, which is a great promoter of sickness in hot
climates. To prevent this, and agreeable to some hints I had from Sir Hugh Palliser and from Captain
Campbell, I took every necessary precaution by airing and drying the ship with fires made betwixt
decks, smoaking, &amp;c. and by obliging the people to air their bedding, wash and dry their
clothes, whenever there was an opportunity. A neglect of these things causeth a disagreeable smell
below, affects the air, and seldom fails to bring on sickness, but more especially in hot and wet
weather.</p><p>We now began to see some of those birds which are said never to fly far from land; that is,
man-of-war and tropic birds, gannets, &amp;c. No land, however, that we knew of, could be nearer
than eighty leagues.</p><p>On the 30th at <time>noon</time>, being in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="1">2° 35' N</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">7° 30' W</geo>., and the wind having
veered to the east of south, we tacked and stretched to the S.W. In the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="2">0° 52' N</geo>.,
longitude <geo select="lon" n="2">9° 25' W</geo>., we had one calm day, which gave us an opportunity of trying the current in a
boat. We found it set to the north one-third of a mile an hour. We had reason to expect this from
the difference we frequently found between the observed latitude, and that given by the log; and Mr
Kendal's watch shewed us that it set to the east also. This was fully confirmed by the lunar
observations; when it appeared that we were 3° 0' more to the east than the common reckoning. At the
time of trying the current, the mercury in the thermometer in the open air stood at 75-1/2; and when
immerged in the surface of the sea, at 74; but when immerged eighty fathoms deep (where it remained
fifteen minutes) when it came up, the mercury stood at 66. At the same time we sounded, without out
finding the bottom, with a line of two hundred and fifty fathoms.</p><p>The calm was succeeded by a light breeze at S.W., which kept veering by little and little to the
south, and at last to the eastward of south, attended with clear serene weather.</p><p><date>1772 September</date></p><p>At length, on the 8th of September, we crossed the Line in the longitude of <geo select="lon">8° W</geo>.; after which,
the ceremony of ducking, &amp;c., generally practised on this occasion, was not omitted.</p><p>The wind now veering more and more to the east, and blowing a gentle top- gallant gale, in eight
days it carried us into the latitude <geo select="lat">9° 30' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">18° W</geo>. The weather was pleasant; and we
daily saw some of those birds which are looked upon as signs of the vicinity of land; such as
boobies, man of war, tropic birds, and gannets. We supposed they came from the isle of St Matthew,
or Ascension; which isles we must have passed at no great distance.</p><p>On the 27th, in the latitude of <geo select="lat">25° 29' S</geo> , longitude <geo select="lon">24° 54' W</geo>, we discovered a sail to the west
standing after us. She was a snow; and the colours she shewed, either a Portuguese or St George's
ensign, the distance being too great to distinguish the one from the other, and I did not choose to
wait to get nearer, or to speak with her.</p><p>The wind now began to be variable. It first veered to the north, where it remained two days with
fair weather. Afterwards it came round by the west to the south, where it remained two days longer,
and, after a few hours calm, sprung up at S.W. But here it remained not long, before it veered to
S.E.E. and to the north of east; blew fresh, and by squalls, with showers of rain.</p><p><date>1772 October</date></p><p>With these winds we advanced but slowly; and, without meeting with anything remarkable till the
11th of October, when, at 6h 24m 12s, by Mr Kendal's watch, the moon rose about four digits
eclipsed, and soon after we prepared to observe the end of the eclipse, as follows, viz.</p><p> h. m. s.</p><p>By me at 6 53 51 with a common refractor. By Mr Forster 6 55 23 By Mr Wales 6 54 57 quadrant

7/8 </p><p>The next morning, having but little wind, we hoisted a boat out, to try if there was any current,
but found none. From this time to the 16th, we had the wind between the north and east, a gentle
gale. We had for some time ceased to see any of the birds before-mentioned; and were now accompanied
by albatrosses, pintadoes, sheerwaters, &amp;c., and a small grey peterel, less than a pigeon. It
has a whitish belly, and grey back, with a black stroke across from the tip of one wing to the tip
of the other. These birds sometimes visited us in great flights. They are, as well as the pintadoes,
southern birds; and are, I believe, never seen within the tropics, or north of the Line.</p><p>On the 17th, we saw a sail to the N.W., standing to the eastward, which hoisted Dutch colours.
She kept us company for two days, but the third we outsailed her.</p><p>On the 21st, at 7h. 30m. 20s. a, m., our longitude, by the mean of two observed distances of the
sun and moon, was <geo select="lon">8° 4' 30" E</geo>., Mr Kendal's watch at the same time gave 7° 22'. Our latitude was<geo select="lat">35° 
20' N</geo>. The wind was now easterly, and continued so till the 23d, when it veered to N. and N.W. after
some hours calm; in which we put a boat in the water, and Mr Forster shot some albatrosses and other
birds, on which we feasted the next day, and found them exceedingly good. At the same time we saw a
seal, or, as some thought, a sea-lion, which probably might be an inhabitant of one of the isles of
Tristian de Cunhah, being now nearly in their latitude, and about <geo select="lon">5° E</geo>ast of them.</p><p>The wind continued but two days at N.W. and S.W.; then veered to the S.E., where it remained two
days longer; then fixed at N.W., which carried us to our intended port. As we approached the land,
the sea-fowl, which had accompanied us hitherto, began to leave us; at least they did not come in
such numbers. Nor did we see gannets, or the black bird, commonly called the Cape Hen, till we were
nearly within sight of the Cape. Nor did we strike sounding till Penguin Island bore N.N.E., distant
two or three leagues, where we had fifty fathom water. Not but that the soundings may extend farther
off. However, I am very sure that they do not extend very far west from the Cape. For we could not
find ground with a line of 210 fathoms, twenty-five leagues west of Table-Bay; the same at
thirty-five leagues, and at sixty-four leagues. I sounded these three times, in order to find a
bank, which, I had been told, lies to the west of the cape; but how far I never could learn.</p><p>I was told before I left England, by some gentlemen who were well enough acquainted with the
navigation between England and the Cape of Good Hope, that I sailed at an improper season of the
year; and that I should meet with much calm weather, near and under the Line. This probably may be
the case some years. It is, however, not general. On the contrary, we hardly met with any calms; but
a brisk S.W. wind in those very latitudes where the calms are expected. Nor did we meet with any of
those tornadoes, so much spoken of by other navigators. However, what they have said of the current
setting towards the coast of Guinea, as you approach that shore, is true. For, from the time of our
leaving St Jago, to our arrival into the latitude of 1-1/2° N., which was eleven days, we were
carried by the current 3° of longitude more east than our reckoning. On the other hand, after we had
crossed the Line, and got the S.E. trade-wind, we always found, by observation, that the ship
outstripped the reckoning, which we judged to be owing to a current setting between the south and
west. But, upon the whole, the currents in this run seemed to balance each other; for upon our
arrival at the Cape, the difference of longitude by dead reckoning kept from England, without once
being corrected, was only three quarters of a degree less than that by observation.</p><p>At two in the <time>afternoon</time> on the 29th, we made the land of the Cape of Good Hope. The Table
Mountain, which is over the Cape Town, bore E.S.E., distance twelve or fourteen leagues. At this
time it was a good deal obscured by clouds, otherwise it might, from its height, have been seen at a
much greater distance. We now crowded all the sail we could, thinking to get into the bay before
dark. But when we found this could not be accomplished, we shortened sail, and spent the night
standing off and on. Between eight and <time>nine o'clock</time>, the whole sea, within the compass of our sight,
became at once, as it were illuminated; or, what the seamen call, all on fire. This appearance of
the sea, in some degree, is very common; but the cause is not so generally known. Mr Banks and Dr
Solander had satisfied me that it was occasioned by sea-insects. Mr Forster, however, seemed not to
favour this opinion. I therefore had some buckets of water drawn up from alongside the ship, which
we found full of an innumerable quantity of small globular insects, about the size of a common
pin's-head, and quite transparent. There was no doubt of their being living animals, when in their
own proper element, though we could not perceive any life in them: Mr Forster, whose province it is
more minutely to describe things of this nature, was now well satisfied with the cause of the sea's
illumination.</p><p>At length day-light came and brought us fair weather; and having stood into Table Bay, with the
Adventure in company, we anchored in five fathom water. We afterwards moored N.E. and S.W., Green
Point on the west point of the bay, bearing N.W. by W., and the church, in one with the valley
between the Table Mountain and the Sugar-Loaf, or Lion's Head, bearing S.W. by S., and distant from
the landing-place near the fort, one mile.</p><p>We had no sooner anchored than we were visited by the captain of the port, or master-attendant,
some other officers belonging to the company, and Mr Brandt. This last gentleman brought us off such
things as could not fail of being acceptable to persons coming from sea. The purport of the master
attendant's visit was, according to custom, to take an account of the ships; to enquire into the
health of the crews; and, in particular, if the small-pox was on board; a thing they dread, above
all others, at the Cape, and for these purposes a surgeon is always one of the visitants.</p><p>My first step after anchoring, was, to send an officer to wait on Baron Plettenberg, the
governor, to acquaint him with our arrival, and the reasons which induced me to put in there. To
this the officer received a very polite answer; and, upon his return, we saluted the garrison with
eleven guns, which compliment was returned. Soon after I went on shore myself, and waited upon the
governor, accompanied by Captain Furneaux, and the two Mr Forsters. He received us, with very great
politeness, and promised me every assistance the place could afford. From him I learned that two
French ships from the Mauritius, about eight months before, had discovered land, in the latitude of
48° S., and in the meridian of that island, along which they sailed forty miles, till they came to a
bay into which they were about to enter, when they were driven off and separated in a hard gale of
wind, after having lost some of their boats and people, which they had sent to sound the bay. One of
the ships, viz. the La Fortune, soon after arrived at the Mauritius, the captain of which was sent
home to France with an account of the discovery. The governor also informed me, that in March last,
two other French ships from the island of Mauritius, touched at the Cape in their way to the South
Pacific Ocean; where they were going to make discoveries, under the command of M. Marion. Aotourou,
the man M. de Bougainville brought from Otaheite, was to have returned with M. Marion, had he been
living.</p><p>After having visited the governor and some other principal persons of the place, we fixed
ourselves at Mr Brandt's, the usual residence of most officers belonging to English ships. This
gentleman spares neither trouble nor expence to make his house agreeable to those who favour him
with their company, and to accommodate them with every thing they want. With him I concerted
measures for supplying the ships with provisions, and all other necessaries they wanted; which he
set about procuring without delay, while the seamen on board were employed in overhauling the
rigging; and the carpenters in caulking the ships' sides and decks, &amp;c.</p><p>Messrs Wales and Bayley got all their instruments on shore, in order to make astronomical
observations for ascertaining the going of the watches, and other purposes. The result of some of
these observations shewed, that Mr Kendal's watch had answered beyond all expectation, by pointing
out the longitude of this place to within one minute of time to what it was observed by Messrs Mason
and Dixon in 1761.</p><p>Three or four days after us, two Dutch Indiamen arrived here from Holland; after a passage of
between four and five months, in which one lost, by the scurvy and other putrid diseases, 150 men,
and the other 41. They sent, on their arrival, great numbers to the hospital in very dreadful
circumstances. It is remarkable that one of these ships touched at Port Praya, and left it a month
before we arrived there; and yet we got here three days before her. The Dutch at the Cape having
found their hospital too small for the reception of their sick, were going to build a new one at the
east part of the town; the foundation of which was laid with great ceremony while we were there.</p><p><date>1772 November</date></p><p>By the healthy condition of the crews of both ships at our arrival, I thought to have made my
stay at the Cape very short. But, as the bread we wanted was unbaked, and the spirit, which I found
scarce, to be collected from different parts out of the country, it was the 18th of November before
we had got every thing on board, and the 22d before we could put to sea. During this stay the crews
of both ships were served every day with fresh beef or mutton, new-baked bread, and as much greens
as they could eat. The ships were caulked and painted; and, in every respect, put in as good a
condition as when they left England. Some alterations in the officers took place in the Adventure.
Mr Shank the first lieutenant having been in an ill state of health ever since we sailed from
Plymouth, and not finding himself recover here, desired my leave to quit, in order to return home
for the re- establishment of his health. As his request appeared to be well-founded, I granted him
leave accordingly, and appointed Mr Kemp, first lieutenant in his room, and Mr Burney, one of my
midshipmen, second, in the room of Mr Kemp.</p><p>Mr Forster, whose whole time was taken up in the pursuit of natural history and botany, met with
a Swedish gentleman, one Mr Sparman, who understood something of these sciences, having studied
under Dr Linnæus. He being willing to embark with us, Mr Forster strongly importuned me to take him
on board, thinking that he would be of great assistance to him in the course of the voyage. I at
last consented, and he embarked with us accordingly, as an assistant to Mr Forster, who bore his
expences on board, and allowed him a yearly stipend besides.</p><p>Mr Hodges employed himself here in drawing a view of the Cape, town, and parts adjacent, in oil
colours, which, was properly packed up with some others, and left with Mr Brandt, in order to be
forwarded to the Admiralty by the first ship that should sail for England.</p></div><div type="chapter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N"><head><l part="N">CHAPTER II.</l><l part="N"><emph rend="italic">Departure from the Cape of Good Hope, in search of a Southern Continent.</emph></l></head><p><date>1772 November</date></p><p>Having at length finished my business at the Cape, and taken leave of the governor and some
others of the chief officers, who, with very obliging readiness, had given me all the assistance I
could desire, on the 22d of November we repaired on board; and at <time>three o'clock</time> in the <time>afternoon</time>
weighed, and came to sail with the wind at N. by W. As soon as the anchor was up, we saluted the
port with fifteen guns, which was immediately returned; and after making a few trips, got out of the
bay by <time>seven o'clock</time>, at which time the town bore S.E. distant four miles. After this we stood to
the westward all night, in order to get clear of the land, having the wind at N.N.W. and N.W.,
blowing in squalls attended with rain, which obliged us to reef our topsails. The sea was again
illuminated for some time, in the same manner as it was the night before we arrived in Table
Bay.</p><p>Having got clear of the land, I directed my course for Cape Circumcision. The wind continued at
N.W. a moderate gale, until the 24th, when it veered round to the eastward. On the <time>noon</time> of this day,
we were in the latitude of <geo select="lat">35° 25' S</geo>., and 29' west of the Cape; and had abundance of albatrosses
about us, several of which were caught with hook and line; and were very well relished by many of
the people, notwithstanding they were at this time served with fresh mutton. Judging that we should
soon come into cold weather, I ordered slops to be served to such as were in want; and gave to each
man the fearnought jacket and trowsers allowed them by the Admiralty.</p><p><date>1772 December</date></p><p>The wind continued easterly for two days, and blew a moderate gale, which brought us into the
latitude of <geo select="lat">39° 4' S</geo>,  and 2° of longitude west of the Cape, thermometer 52-1/2 The wind now came to W.
and S.W.; and on the 29th fixed at W.N.W., and increased to a storm, which continued, with some few
intervals of moderate weather, till the 6th of December, when we were in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="1">48° 41' S</geo>.,
and longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">18° 24' E</geo>. This gale, which was attended with rain and hail, blew at times with such
violence that we could carry no sails; by which means we were driven far to the eastward of our
intended course, and no hopes were left me of reaching Cape Circumcision. But the greatest
misfortune that attended us, was the loss of great part of our live stock, which we had brought from
the Cape, and which consisted of sheep, hogs, and geese. Indeed this sudden transition from warm,
mild weather, to extreme cold and wet, made every man in the ship feel its effects. For by this time
the mercury in the thermometer had fallen to 38; whereas at the Cape it was generally at 67 and
upwards. I now made some addition to the people's allowance of spirit, by giving them a dram
whenever I thought it necessary, and ordered Captain Furneaux to do the same. The night proved clear
and serene, and the only one that was so since we left the Cape; and the next morning the rising sun
gave us such flattering hopes of a fine day, that we were induced to let all the reefs out of the
top-sails, and to get top-gallant yards across, in order to make the most of a fresh gale at north.
Our hopes, however, soon vanished; for before <time>eight o'clock</time>, the serenity of the sky was changed
into a thick haze, accompanied with rain. The gale increasing obliged us to hand the main-sail,
close-reef our top-sails, and to strike top-gallant yards. The barometer at this time was unusually
low, which foreboded an approaching storm, and this happened accordingly. For, by <time>one o'clock</time> p. m.
the wind, which was at N.W., blew with such strength as obliged us to take in all our sails, to
strike top-gallant-masts, and to get the spritsail-yard in. And I thought proper to wear, and
lie-to, under a mizzen-stay-sail, with the ships' heads to the N.E. as they would bow the sea, which
ran prodigiously high, better on this tack.</p><p>At <time>eight o'clock</time> next morning, being the 8th, we wore, and lay on the other tack; the gale was a
little abated, but the sea ran too high to make sail, any more than the fore-top-mast-stay-sail. In
the evening, being in the latitude of <geo select="lat">49° 40 S</geo>., and 1-1/2° E. of the Cape, we saw two penguins and
some sea or rock-weed, which occasioned us to sound, without finding ground at 100 fathoms. At eight
p. m. we wore, and lay with our heads to the N.E. till three in the morning of the 9th, then wore
again to the southward, the wind blowing in squalls attended with showers of snow. At eight, being
something more moderate, I made the Adventure signal to make sail; and soon after made sail
ourselves under the courses and close-reefed top-sails. In the evening, took in the top-sails and
main-sail, and brought-to under fore-sail and mizzen; thermometer at 36°. The wind still at N.W.
blew a fresh gale, accompanied with a very high sea. In the night had a pretty smart frost with
snow.</p><p>In the morning of the 10th we made sail under courses and top-sails close- reefed; and made the
signal for the Adventure to make sail and lead. At <time>eight o'clock</time> saw an island of ice to the
westward of us, being then in the latitude of <geo select="lat">56° 40' S</geo>. and longitude <geo select="lon">2° 0' E</geo>. of the Cape of Good
Hope. Soon after the wind moderated, and we let all the reefs out of the top- sails, got the
spritsail-yard out, and top-gallant-mast up. The weather coming hazy, I called the Adventure by
signal under my stern, which was no sooner done, than the haze increased so much with snow and
sleet, that we did not see an island of ice, which we were steering directly for, till we were less
than a mile from it. I judged it to be about 50 feet high, and half a mile in circuit. It was flat
at top, and its sides rose in a perpendicular direction, against which the sea broke exceedingly
high. Captain Furneaux at first took this ice for land, and hauled off from it, until called back by
signal. As the weather was foggy, it was necessary to proceed with caution. We therefore reefed our
top-sails, and at the same time sounded, but found no ground with 150 fathoms. We kept on to the
southward with the wind at north till night, which we spent in making short trips, first one way and
then another, under an easy sail; thermometer these 24 hours from 36-1/2 to 31.</p><p>At day-light in the morning of the 11th, we made sail to the southward with the wind at west,
having a fresh gale, attended with sleet and snow. At <time>noon</time> we were in the latitude of <geo select="lat">51° 50' S</geo>.,
and longitude <geo select="lon">21° 3' E</geo>., where we saw some white birds about the size of pigeons, with blackish
bills and feet. I never saw any such before; and Mr Forster had no knowledge of them. I believe them
to be of the peterel tribe, and natives of these icy seas. At this time we passed between two ice
islands, which lay at a little distance from each other.</p><p>In the night the wind veered to N.W. which enabled us to steer S.W. On the 12th we had still
thick hazy weather, with sleet and snow; so that we were obliged to proceed with great caution on
account of the ice islands. Six of these we passed this day; some of them near two miles in circuit,
and sixty feet high. And yet, such was the force and height of the waves, that the sea broke quite
over them. This exhibited a view which for a few moments was pleasing to the eye; but when we
reflected on the danger, the mind was filled with horror. For were a ship to get against the
weather-side of one of these islands when the sea runs high, she would be dashed to pieces in a
moment. Upon our getting among the ice islands, the albatrosses left us; that is, we saw but one now
and then. Nor did our other companions, the pintadoes, sheerwaters, small grey birds, fulmars,
&amp;c., appear in such numbers; on the other hand, penguins began to make their appearance. Two of
these birds were seen to-day.</p><p>The wind in the night veered to west, and at last fixed at S.W., a fresh gale, with sleet and
snow, which froze on our sails and rigging as it fell, so that they were all hung with icicles. We
kept on to the southward, passed no less than eighteen ice islands, and saw more penguins. At <time>noon</time>
on the 13th, we were in the latitude of <geo select="lat">54° S</geo>., which is the latitude of Cape Circumcision,
discovered by M. Bouvet in 1739; but we were ten degrees of longitude east of it; that is, near 118
leagues in this latitude. We stood on to the S.S.E. till <time>eight o'clock  in the evening</time>, the weather
still continuing thick and hazy, with sleet and snow. From <time>noon</time> till this time, twenty ice islands,
of various extent, both for height and circuit, presented themselves to our view. At <time>eight o'clock</time>
we sounded, but found no ground with 150 fathom of line.</p><p>We now tacked and made a trip to the northward till midnight, when we stood again to the
southward; and at half an hour past <time>six o'clock  in the morning</time> of the 14th, we were stopped by an
immense field of low ice; to which we could see no end, either to the east, west, or south. In
different parts of this field were islands or hills of ice, like those we found floating in the sea;
and some on board thought they saw land also over the ice, bearing S.W. by S. I even thought so
myself; but changed my opinion upon more narrowly examining these ice hills, and the various
appearances they made when seen through the haze. For at this time it was both hazy and cloudy in
the horizon; so that a distant object could not be seen distinct. Being now in the latitude of<geo select="lat">54° 
50' S</geo>. and longitude <geo select="lon">21° 34' E</geo>., and having the wind at N.W. we bore away along the edge of the ice,
steering S.S.E. and S.E., according to the direction of the north side of it, where we saw many
whales, penguins, some white birds, pintadoes, &amp;c.</p><p>At <time>eight o'clock</time> we brought-to under a point of the ice, where we had smooth water: and I sent on
board for Captain Furneaux. After we had fixed on rendezvouses in case of separation, and some other
matters for the better keeping company, he returned on board, and we made sail again along the ice.
Some pieces we took up along-side, which yielded fresh water. At <time>noon</time> we had a good observation, and
found ourselves in latitude <geo select="lat">54° 55' S</geo>.</p><p>We continued a south-east course along the edge of the ice, till <time>one o'clock</time>, when we came to a
point round which we hauled S.S.W., the sea appearing to be clear of ice in that direction. But
after running four leagues upon this course, with the ice on our starboard side, we found ourselves
quite imbayed; the ice extending from N.N.E. round by the west and south, to east, in one compact
body. The weather was indifferently clear; and yet we could see no end to it. At <time>five o'clock</time> we
hauled up east, wind at north, a gentle gale, in order to clear the ice. The extreme east point of
it, at <time>eight o'clock</time>, bore E. by S., over which appeared a clear sea. We however spent the night in
making short boards, under an easy sail. Thermometer, these 24 hours, from 32 to 30.</p><p>Next day, the 15th, we had the wind at N.W., a small gale, thick foggy weather, with much snow;
thermometer from 32 to 27; so that our sails and rigging were all hung with icicles. The fog was so
thick at times, that we could not see the length of the ship; and we had much difficulty to avoid
the many islands of ice that surrounded us. About <time>noon</time>, having but little wind, we hoisted out a
boat to try the current, which we found set S.E. near 3/4 of a mile an hour. At the same time, a
thermometer, which in the open air was at 32°, in the surface of the sea was at 30°; and, after
being immerged 100 fathoms deep for about fifteen or twenty minutes, came up at 34°, which is only
2° above freezing. Our latitude at this time was <geo select="lat">55° 8' S</geo>.</p><p>The thick fog continued till <time>two o'clock</time> in the <time>afternoon</time> of the next day, when it cleared away a
little, and we made sail to the southward, wind still at N.W. a gentle gale. We had not run long to
the southward before we fell in with the main field of ice extending from S.S.W. to E. We now bore
away to east along the edge of it; but at night hauled off north, with the wind at W.N.W., a gentle
gale, attended with snow.</p><p>At four in the morning on the 17th, stood again to the south; but was again obliged to bear up on
account of the ice, along the side of which we steered betwixt E. and S.S.W., hauling into every bay
or opening, in hopes of finding a passage to the south. But we found every where the ice closed. We
had a gentle gale at N.W. with showers of snow. At <time>noon</time> we were, by observation, in the latitude of
<geo select="lat">55° 16' S</geo>. In the evening the weather was clear and serene. In the course of this day we saw many
whales, one seal, penguins, some of the white birds, another sort of peterel, which is brown and
white, and not much unlike a pintado; and some other sorts already known. We found the skirts of the
loose ice to be more broken than usual; and it extended some distance beyond the main field,
insomuch that we sailed amongst it the most part of the day; and the high ice islands without us
were innumerable. At <time>eight o'clock</time> we sounded, but found no ground with 250 fathoms of line. After
this we hauled close upon a wind to the northward, as we could see the field of ice extend as far as
N.E. But this happened not to be the northern point; for at <time>eleven o'clock</time> we were obliged to tack
to avoid it.</p><p>At <time>two o'clock</time> the next morning we stood again to the northward, with the wind at N.W. by W.,
thinking to weather the ice upon this tack; on which we stood but two hours, before we found
ourselves quite imbayed, being then in latitude <geo select="lat">55° 8' S</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon">24° 3' E</geo>. The wind veering more to
the north, we tacked and stood to the westward under all the sail we could carry, having a fresh
breeze and clear weather, which last was of short duration. For at <time>six o'clock</time> it became hazy, and
soon after there was thick fog; the wind veered to the N.E., freshened and brought with it snow and
sleet, which froze on the rigging as it fell. We were now enabled to get clear of the field of ice:
but at the same time we were carried in amongst the ice islands, in a manner equally dangerous, and
which with much difficulty we kept clear of.</p><p>Dangerous as it is to sail among these floating rocks (if I may be allowed to call them so) in a
thick fog, this, however, is preferable to being entangled with immense fields of ice under the same
circumstances. The great danger to be apprehended in this latter case, is the getting fast in the
ice; a situation which would be exceedingly alarming. I had two men on board that had been in the
Greenland trade; the one of them in a ship that lay nine weeks, and the other in one that lay six
weeks, fast in this kind of ice, which they called packed ice. What they called field ice is
thicker; and the whole field, be it ever so large, consists of one piece. Whereas this which I call
field-ice, from its immense extent, consists of many pieces of various sizes, both in thickness and
surface, from thirty or forty feet square to three or four, packed close together, and in places
heaped one upon another. This, I am of opinion, would be found too hard for a ship's side, that is
not properly armed against it. How long it may have lain, or will lie here, is a point not easily
determined. Such ice is found in the Greenland seas all the summer long; and I think it cannot be
colder there in the summer, than it is here. Be this as it may, we certainly had no thaw; on the
contrary, the mercury in Fahrenheit's thermometer kept generally below the freezing point, although
it was the middle of summer.</p><p>It is a general opinion, that the ice I have been speaking of, is formed in bays and rivers.
Under this supposition we were led to believe that land was not far distant; and that it even lay to
the southward behind the ice, which alone hindered us from approaching to it. Therefore, as we had
now sailed above thirty leagues along the edge of the ice, without finding a passage to the south, I
determined to run thirty or forty leagues to the east, afterwards endeavour to get to the southward,
and, if I met with no land, or other impediment, to get behind the ice, and put the matter out of
all manner of dispute. With this view, we kept standing to the N.W., with the wind at N.E. and N.,
thick foggy weather, with sleet and snow, till six in the evening, when the wind veered to N.W., and
we tacked and stood to the eastward, meeting with many islands of ice of different magnitudes, and
some loose pieces: The thermometer from 30 to 34; weather very hazy, with sleet and snow, and more
sensibly colder than the thermometer seemed to point out, insomuch that the whole crew complained.
In order to enable them to support this weather the better, I caused the sleeves of their jackets
(which were so short as to expose their arms) to be lengthened with baize; and had a cap made for
each man of the same stuff, together with canvas; which proved of great service to them.</p><p>Some of our people appearing to have symptoms of the scurvy, the surgeons began to give them
fresh wort every day, made from the malt we had on board for that purpose. One man in particular was
highly scorbutic; and yet he had been taking the rob of lemon and orange for some time, without
being benefited thereby. On the other hand, Captain Furneaux told me, that he had two men, who,
though far gone in this disease, were now in a manner entirely cured by it.</p><p>We continued standing to the eastward till <time>eight o'clock  in the morning</time> of the 21st; when, being
in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="1">53° 50' S</geo> , and longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">29° 24' E</geo>., we hauled to the south, with the wind at west,
a fresh gale and hazy, with snow. In the evening the wind fell and the weather cleared up, so as
that we could see a few leagues round us; being in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="2">54° 43' S</geo>. longitude <geo select="lon" n="2">29° 30'
E</geo>.</p><p>At <time>ten o'clock</time>, seeing many islands of ice a-head, and the weather coming on foggy, with snow, we
wore and stood to the northward, till three in the morning, when we stood again to the south. At
eight, the weather cleared up, and the wind came to W.S.W., with which we made all the sail we could
to the south; having never less than ten or twelve islands of ice in sight.</p><p>Next day we had the wind at S.W. and S.S.W., a gentle gale, with now and then showers of snow and
hail. In the morning, being in the latitude of <geo select="lat">55° 20' S</geo>., and longitude <geo select="lon">31° 30' E</geo>., we hoisted out
a boat to see if there was any current, but found none. Mr Forster, who went in the boat, shot some
of the small grey birds before-mentioned, which were of the peterel tribe, and about the size of a
small pigeon. Their back, and upper side of their wings, their feet and bills, are of a blue-grey
colour. Their bellies, and under side of their wings are white, a little tinged with blue. The upper
side of their quill feathers is a dark-blue tinged with black. A streak is formed by feathers nearly
of this colour, along the upper parts of the wings, and crossing the back a little above the tail.
The end of the tail feathers is also of the same colour. Their bills are much broader than any I
have seen of the same tribe; and their tongues are remarkably broad. These blue peterels, as I shall
call them, are seen no where but in the southern hemisphere, from about the latitude of<geo select="lat">28° S</geo> , and
upwards. Thermometer at 33° in the open air, and 32° in the sea at the surface, and at 34-1/2 when
drawn, and 6-1/2 minutes in drawing up from 100 fathoms below it, where it had been sixteen
minutes.</p><p>On the 24th, the wind blew from N.W. to N.E., a gentle gale, fair and cloudy. At <time>noon</time> we were by
observation, in the latitude of <geo select="lat">56° 31' S</geo>, and longitude <geo select="lon">31° 19' E</geo>., the thermometer at 35. And
being near an island of ice, which was about fifty feet high, and 400 fathoms in circuit, I sent the
master in the jolly-boat to see if any water run from it. He soon returned with an account that
there was not one drop, or any other appearance of thaw. In the evening we sailed through several
floats, or fields of loose ice, lying in the direction of S.E. and N.W.; at the same time we had
continually several islands of the same composition in sight.</p><p>On the 25th, the wind veering round from the N.E., by the east to south, it blew a gentle gale;
with which we stood to the W.S.W, and at <time>noon</time> were in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="1">57° 50' S</geo>., and longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">29°
32' E</geo>. The weather was fair and cloudy; the air sharp and cold, attended with a hard frost. And,
although this was the middle of summer with us, I much question if the day was colder in any part of
England. The wind continued at south, blew a fresh gale, fair and cloudy weather, till near <time>noon</time> the
next day, when we had clear sun-shine, and found ourselves, by observation, in the latitude of<geo select="lat" n="2">58° 
31' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="2">26° 57' E</geo>.</p><p>In the course of the last twenty-four hours we passed through several fields of broken loose ice.
They were in general narrow, but of a considerable length, in the direction of N.W. and S.E. The ice
was so close in one, that it would hardly admit the ship through it. The pieces were flat, from four
to six or eight inches thick, and appeared of that sort of ice which is generally formed in bays or
rivers. Others again were different; the pieces forming various honey-combed branches, exactly like
coral rocks, and exhibiting such a variety of figures as can hardly be conceived.</p><p>We supposed this ice to have broke from the main field we had lately left; and which I was
determined to get to the south of, or behind, if possible, in order to satisfy myself whether or not
it joined to any land, as had been conjectured. With this view I kept on to the westward, with a
gentle gale at south, and S.S.W., and soon after <time>six o'clock  in the evening</time>, we saw some penguins,
which occasioned us to sound; but we found no ground with 150 fathoms.</p><p>In the morning of the 27th, we saw more loose ice, but not many islands; and those we did see
were but small. The day being calm and pleasant, and the sea smooth, we hoisted out a boat, from
which Mr Forster shot a penguin and some peterels. These penguins differ not from those seen in
other parts of the world, except in some minute particulars distinguishable only by naturalists.
Some of the peterels were of the blue sort, but differed from those before-mentioned, in not having
a broad bill; and the ends of their tail feathers were tipped with white instead of dark-blue. But
whether these were only the distinctions betwixt the male and female, was a matter disputed by our
naturalists. We were now in the latitude of <geo select="lat">58° 19' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">24° 39' E</geo>., and took the
opportunity of the calm, to sound; but found no ground with a line of 220 fathoms. The calm
continued till six in the evening, when it was succeeded by a light breeze from the east, which
afterwards increased to a fresh gale.</p><p>In the morning of the 28th I made the signal to the Adventure to spread four miles on my
starboard beam; and in this position we continued sailing W.S.W., until <time>four o'clock</time> in the
<time>afternoon</time>, when the hazy weather, attended with snow showers, made it necessary for us to join. Soon
after we reefed our top-sails, being surrounded on all sides with islands of ice. In the morning of
the 29th we let them out again, and set top-gallant-sails; still continuing our course to the
westward, and meeting with several penguins. At <time>noon</time> we were by observation in the latitude of<geo select="lat">59° 
12' S</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon">19° 1' E</geo>., which is 3° more to the west than we were when we first fell in with the
field of ice; so that it is pretty clear that it joined to no land, as we conjectured.</p><p>Having come to a resolution to run as far west as the meridian of Cape Circumcision, provided we
met with no impediment, as the distance was not more than eighty leagues, the wind favourable, and
the sea seemed to be pretty clear of ice, I sent on board for Captain Furneaux, to make him
acquainted therewith, and after dinner he returned to his ship. At <time>one o'clock</time> we steered for an
island of ice, thinking if there were any loose ice round it, to take some on board, and convert it
into fresh water. At four we brought-to, close under the lee of the island, where we did not find
what we wanted, but saw upon it eighty-six penguins. This piece of ice was about half a mile in
circuit, and one hundred feet high and upwards, for we lay for some minutes with every sail becalmed
under it. The side on which the penguins were, rose sloping from the sea, so as to admit them to
creep up it.</p><p>It is a received opinion, that penguins never go far from land, and that the sight of them is a
sure indication of its vicinity. The opinion may hold good where there are no ice islands; but where
such are, these birds, as well as many others which usually keep near the shores, finding a
roosting-place upon these islands, may be brought by them a great distance from any land. It will,
however, be said, that they must go on shore to breed, that probably the females were there, and
that these are only the males which we saw. Be this as it may, I shall continue to take notice of
these birds whenever we see them, and leave every one to judge for himself.</p><p>We continued our course to the westward, with a gentle gale at E.N.E., the weather being
sometimes tolerably clear, and at other times thick and hazy, with snow. The thermometer for a few
days past was from 31 to 36. At <time>nine o'clock</time> the next morning, being the 30th, we shot one of the
white birds, upon which we lowered a boat into the water to take it up, and by that means killed a
penguin which weighed eleven pounds and a half. The white bird was of the peterel tribe; the bill,
which is rather short, is of a colour between black and dark blue, and their legs and feet are blue.
I believe them to be the same sort of birds that Bouvet mentions to have seen when he was off Cape
Circumcision.</p><p>We continued our westerly course till <time>eight o'clock  in the evening</time>, when we steered N.W., the
point on which I reckoned the above-mentioned cape to bear. At midnight we fell in with loose ice,
which soon after obliged us to tack, and stretch to the southward. At half an hour past <time>two o'clock</time>
in the morning of the 31st, we stood for it again, thinking to take some on board, but this was
found impracticable; for the wind, which had been at N.E, now veered to S.E., and increasing to a
fresh gale, brought with it such a sea as made it very dangerous for the ships to remain among the
ice. The danger was yet farther increased by discovering an immense field to the north, extending
from N.E. by E. to S.W. by W. farther than the eye could reach. As we were not above two or three
miles from this, and surrounded by loose ice, there was no time to deliberate. We presently wore;
got our tacks on board; hauled to the south, and soon got clear; but not before we had received
several hard knocks from the loose pieces, which were of the largest sort, and among which we saw a
seal. In the <time>afternoon</time> the wind increased in such a manner, as to oblige us to hand the top-sails,
and strike top-gallant-yards. At <time>eight o'clock</time> we tacked and stood to the east till midnight; when
being in the latitude of <geo select="lat">60° 21' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">13° 32' E</geo>, we stood again to the west.</p><p><date>1773 January</date></p><p>Next day, towards <time>noon</time>, the gale abated, so that we could carry close- reefed top-sails. But the
weather continued thick and hazy, with sleet and snow, which froze on the rigging as it fell, and
ornamented the whole with icicles; the mercury in the thermometer being generally below the freezing
point. This weather continued till near <time>noon</time> the next day; at which time we were in the latitude of
<geo select="lat">59° 12' S</geo>.; longitude <geo select="lon">9° 45' E</geo>.; and here we saw some penguins.</p><p>The wind had now veered to the west, and was so moderate, that we could bear two reefs out of the
top-sails. In the <time>afternoon</time>, we were favoured with a sight of the moon, whose face we had seen but
once since we left the Cape of Good Hope. By this a judgment may be formed of the sort of weather we
had since we left that place. We did not fail to seize the opportunity to make several observations
of the sun and moon. The longitude deduced from it was <geo select="lon">9° 34' 30" E</geo>. Mr Kendal's watch, at the same
time, giving <geo select="lon">10° 6' E</geo>., and the latitude was <geo select="lat">58° 53' 30" S</geo>.</p><p>This longitude is nearly the same that is assigned to Cape Circumcision; and at the going down of
the sun we were about ninety-five leagues to the south of the latitude it is said to lie in. At this
time the weather was so clear, that we might have seen land at fourteen or fifteen leagues distance.
It is, therefore very probable, that what Bouvet took for land, was nothing but mountains of ice,
surrounded by loose or field-ice. We ourselves were undoubtedly deceived by the ice-hills, the day
we first fell in with the field-ice. Nor was it an improbable conjecture, that that ice joined to
land. The probability was however now greatly lessened, if not entirely set aside; for the space
between the northern edge of the ice, along which we sailed, and our route to the west, when south
of it, no where exceeded 100 leagues, and in some places not 60. The clear weather continued no
longer than <time>three o'clock</time> the next morning, when it was succeeded by a thick fog, sleet, and snow.
The wind also veered to N.E. and blew a fresh gale, with which we stood to S.E. It increased in such
a manner, that before <time>noon</time> we were brought under close-reefed top-sails. The wind continued to veer
to the north, at last fixed at N.W., and was attended with intervals of clear weather.</p><p>Our course was E. 1/4 N., till <time>noon</time> the next day, when we were in the latitude of <geo select="lat">59° 2' S</geo>., and
nearly under the same meridian as we were when we fell in with the last field of ice, five days
before; so that had it remained in the same situation, we must now have been in the middle of it,
whereas we did not so much as see any. We cannot suppose that so large a float of ice as this was,
could be destroyed in so short a time. It therefore must have drifted to the northward: and this
makes it probable that there is no land under this meridian, between the latitude of 55° S  and 59°,
where we had supposed some to lie, as mentioned above.</p><p>As we were now only sailing over a part of the sea where we had been before, I directed the
course E.S.E. in order to get more to the south. We had the advantage of a fresh gale, and the
disadvantage of a thick fog; much snow and sleet, which, as usual, froze on our rigging as it fell;
so that every rope was covered with the finest transparent ice I ever saw. This afforded an
agreeable sight enough to the eye, but conveyed to the mind an idea of coldness, much greater than
it really was; for the weather was rather milder then it had been for some time past, and the sea
less encumbered with ice. But the worst was, the ice so clogged the rigging, sails, and blocks, as
to make them exceedingly bad to handle. Our people, however, surmounted those difficulties with a
steady perseverance, and withstood this intense cold much better than I expected.</p><p>We continued to steer to the E.S.E. with a fresh gale at N.W. attended with snow and sleet, till
the 8th, when we were in the latitude of <geo select="lat">61° 12' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">31° 47' E</geo>. In the <time>afternoon</time> we passed
more ice islands than we had seen for several days. Indeed they were now so familiar to us, that
they were often passed unnoticed; but more generally unseen on account of the thick weather. At <time>nine
o'clock in the evening</time>, we came to one, which had a quantity of loose ice about it. As the wind was
moderate, and the weather tolerably fair, we shortened sail, and stood on and off, with a view of
taking some on board on the return of light. But at <time>four o'clock  in the morning</time>, finding ourselves
to leeward of this ice, we bore down to an island to leeward of us; there being about it some loose
ice, part of which we saw break off. There we brought-to; hoisted out three boats; and in about five
or six hours, took up as much ice as yielded fifteen tons of good fresh water. The pieces we took up
were hard, and solid as a rock; some of them were so large, that we were obliged to break them with
pick- axes before they could be taken into the boats.</p><p>The salt water which adhered to the ice, was so trifling as not to be tasted, and, after it had
lain on deck for a short time, entirely drained off; and the water which the ice yielded, was
perfectly sweet and well- tasted. Part of the ice we broke in pieces, and put into casks; some we
melted in the coppers, and filled up the casks with the water; and some we kept on deck for present
use. The melting and stowing away the ice is a little tedious, and takes up some time; otherwise
this is the most expeditious way of watering I ever met with.</p><p>Having got on board this supply of water, and the Adventure about two- thirds as much (of which
we stood in great need,) as we had once broke the ice, I did not doubt of getting more whenever we
were in want. I therefore without hesitation directed our course more to the south, with a gentle
gale at N.W., attended, as usual, with snow showers. In the morning of the 11th, being then in the
latitude of <geo select="lat" n="1">62° 44' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">37° E</geo>., the variation of the compass was <geo select="lon">24° 10' W</geo>., and the
following morning in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="2">64° 12' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="2">38° 14' E</geo>., by the mean of three
compasses, it was no more than <geo select="lon">23° 52' W</geo>. In this situation we saw some penguins; and being near an
island of ice from which several pieces had broken, we hoisted out two boats, and took on board as
much as filled all our empty casks, and the Adventure did the same. While this was doing, Mr Forster
shot an albatross, whose plumage was of a colour between brown and dark-grey, the head and upper
side of the wings rather inclining to black, and it had white eye-brows. We began to see these birds
about the time of our first falling in with the ice islands; and some have accompanied us ever
since. These, and the dark-brown sort with a yellow bill, were the only albatrosses that had not now
forsaken us.</p><p>At <time>four o'clock</time> p.m. we hoisted in the boats, and made sail to the S.E., with a gentle breeze at
S. by W., attended with showers of snow.</p><p>On the 13th, at <time>two o'clock</time> a. m. it fell calm. Of this we took the opportunity to hoist out a
boat, to try the current, which we found to set N.W. near one-third of a mile an hour. At the time
of trying the current, a Fahrenheit's thermometer was immerged in the sea 100 fathoms below its
surface, where it remained twenty minutes. When it came up, the mercury stood at 32, which is the
freezing point. Some little time after, being exposed to the surface of the sea, it rose to 33-1/2,
and in the open air to 36. The calm continued till <time>five o'clock  in the evening</time>, when it was
succeeded by a light breeze from the S. and S.E., with which we stood to the N.E. with all our sails
set.</p><p>Though the weather continued fair, the sky, as usual, was clouded. However, at <time>nine o'clock</time> the
next morning, it was clear; and we were enabled to observe several distances between the sun and
moon. The mean result of which gave <geo select="lon">39° 30' 30" E</geo>. longitude. Mr Kendal's watch at the same time
gave <geo select="lon">38° 27' 45" W</geo>hich is <geo select="lon">1° 2' 45" W</geo>. of the observations; whereas, on the 3d instant, it was half
a degree E. of them.</p><p>In the evening I found the variation by the mean of azimuths taken with Gregory's compass to be
28° 14' 0"</p><p>By the mean of six azimuths by one of Dr   Knight's 28 32 0 </p><p>And by another of Dr Knight's 28 34 0</p><p>Our latitude at this time was <geo select="lat">63° 57' S</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon">39° 38.5'</geo></p><p>The succeeding morning, the 15th, being then in latitude <geo select="lat">63° 33' S</geo>., the longitude was observed
by the following persons, viz.</p><p>Myself, being the mean of six distances of   the sun and moon <geo select="lon">40° 1' 45" E</geo>. </p><p>Mr Wales, ditto 39 29 45</p><p>Ditto, ditto 39 56 45</p><p>Lieutenant Clerke, ditto 39 38 0</p><p>Mr Gilbert, ditto 39 48 45</p><p>Mr Smith, ditto 39 18 15 ————— Mean 39 42 12</p><p>Mr Kendal's watch made 38 41 30</p><p>which is nearly the same difference as the day before. But Mr Wales and I took each of us six
distances of the sun and moon, with the telescopes fixed to our sextants, which brought out the
longitude nearly the same as the watch.</p><p>The results were as follows:—By Mr Wales, 38° 35' 30", and by me, 38° 36' 45".</p><p>It is impossible for me to say whether these or the former are the nearest to the truth; nor can
I assign any probable reason for so great a disagreement. We certainly can observe with greater
accuracy through the telescope, than with the common sight, when the ship is sufficiently steady.
The use of the telescope is found difficult at first, but a little practice will make it familiar.
By the assistance of the watch, we shall be able to discover the greatest error this method of
observing the longitude at sea is liable to; which at the greatest does not exceed a degree and a
half, and in general will be found to be much less. Such is the improvement navigation has received
by the astronomers and mathematical instrument- makers of this age; by the former from the valuable
tables they have communicated to the public, under the direction of the Board of Longitude, and
contained in the astronomical ephemeris; and by the latter, from the great accuracy they observe in
making instruments, without which the tables would, in a great measure, lose their effect. The
preceding observations were made by four different sextants, of different workmen. Mine was by Mr
Bird; one of Mr Wales's by Mr Dollond; the other and Mr Clerke's by Mr Ramsden; as also Mr Gilbert's
and Smith's, who observed with the same instrument.</p><p>Five tolerably fine days had now succeeded one another. This, besides giving us an opportunity to
make the preceding observations, was very serviceable to us on many other accounts, and came at a
very seasonable time. For, having on board a good quantity of fresh water, or ice, which was the
same thing, the people were enabled to wash and dry their clothes and linen; a care that can never
be enough attended to in all long voyages. The winds during this time blew in gentle gales, and the
weather was mild. Yet the mercury in the thermometer never rose above 36; and was frequently as low
as the freezing point.</p><p>In the <time>afternoon</time> having but little wind, I brought-to under an island of ice, and sent a boat to
take up some. In the evening the wind freshened at east, and was attended with snow showers and
thick hazy weather, which continued great part of the 16th. As we met with little ice, I stood to
the south, close hauled; and at <time>six o'clock  in the evening</time>, being in the latitude of <geo select="lat">64° 56' S</geo>.,
longitude <geo select="lon">39° 35' E</geo>. I found the variation by Gregory's compass to be <geo select="lon">26° 41' W</geo>. At this time the
motion of the ship was so great that I could by no means observe with any of Dr Knight's
compasses.</p><p>As the wind remained invariably fixed at E. and E. by S., I continued to stand to the south; and
on the 17th, between eleven and <time>twelve o'clock</time>, we crossed the Antarctic Circle in the longitude of
<geo select="lon">39° 35' E</geo>., for at <time>noon</time> we were by observation in the latitude of <geo select="lat">66° 36' 30" S</geo>. The weather was now
become tolerably clear, so that we could see several leagues round us; and yet we had only seen one
island of ice since the morning. But about four p.m. as we were steering to the south, we observed
the whole sea in a manner covered with ice, from the direction of S.E., round by the S. to W.</p><p>In this space, thirty-eight ice islands, great and small, were seen, besides loose ice in
abundance, so that we were obliged to luff for one piece, and bear up for another, and as we
continued to advance to the south, it increased in such a manner, that at three quarters past six
o'clock, being then in the latitude of <geo select="lat">67° 15' S</geo>., we could proceed no farther; the ice being
entirely closed to the south, in the whole extent from E. to W.S.W., without the least appearance of
any opening. This immense field was composed of different kinds of ice; such as high hills, loose or
broken pieces packed close together, and what, I think, Greenlandmen call field-ice. A float of this
kind of ice lay to the S.E. of us, of such extent, that I could see no end to it from the mast-head.
It was sixteen or eighteen feet high at least; and appeared of a pretty equal height and surface.
Here we saw many whales playing about the ice, and for two days before had seen several flocks of
the brown and white pintadoes, which we named Antarctic peterels, because they seem to be natives of
that region. They are, undoubtedly, of the peterel tribe; are in every respect shaped like the
pintadoes, differing only from them in colour. The head and fore-part of the body of these are
brown; and the hind-part of the body, tail, and the ends of the wings, are white. The white peterel
also appeared in greater numbers than before; some few dark-grey albatrosses, and our constant
companion the blue peterel. But the common pintadoes had quite disappeared, as well as many other
sorts, which are common in lower latitudes.</p></div><div type="chapter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N"><head><l part="N">CHAPTER III.</l><l part="N"><emph rend="italic">Sequel of the Search for a Southern Continent, between the Meridian of the Cape

farther to the south; especially as the summer was already half spent, and it would have taken up
some time to have got round the ice, even supposing it to have been practicable; which, however, is
doubtful. I therefore came to a resolution to proceed directly in search of the land lately
discovered by the French. And, as the winds still continued at E. by S., I was obliged to return to
the north, over some part of the sea I had already made myself acquainted with, and, for that
reason, wished to have avoided. But this was not to be done, as our course made good, was little
better than north. In the night the wind increased to a strong gale, attended with sleet and snow,
and obliged us to double-reef our top-sails. About <time>noon</time> the next day the gale abated, so that we
could bear all our reefs out; but the wind still remained in its old quarter.</p><p>In the evening, being in the latitude of <geo select="lat">64° 12' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">40° 15' E</geo>., a bird, called by us
in my former voyage Port Egmont Hen, (on account of the great plenty of them at Port Egmont in
Falkland Isles,) came hovering several times over the ship, and then left us in the direction of
N.E. They are a short thick bird, about the size of a large crow, of a dark-brown or chocolate
colour, with a whitish streak under each wing, in the shape of a half-moon. I have been told that
these birds are found in great plenty at the Fero Isles, North of Scotland; and that they never go
far from land. Certain it is, I never before saw them above forty leagues off; but I do not remember
ever seeing fewer than two together; whereas here was but one, which, with the islands of ice, may
have come a good way from land.</p><p>At <time>nine o'clock</time>, the wind veering to E.N.E., we tacked and stood to the S.S.E, but at four in the
morning of the 20th, it returned back to its old point, and we resumed our northerly course. One of
the above birds was seen this morning, probably the same we saw the night before, as our situation
was not much altered. As the day advanced, the gale increased, attended with thick hazy weather,
sleet, and snow, and at last obliged us to close- reef our top-sails, and strike top-gallant-yards.
But in the evening the wind abated so as to admit us to carry whole top-sails, and top-gallant-
yards aloft. Hazy weather, with snow and sleet continued.</p><p>In the <time>afternoon</time> of the 21st, being in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="1">62° 24' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">42° 19' E</geo>., we saw a
white albatross with black tipped wings, and a pintado bird. The wind was now at S. and S.W., a
fresh gale. With this we steered N.E., against a very high sea, which did not indicate the vicinity
of land in that quarter; and yet it was there we were to expect it. The next day we had intervals of
fair weather, the wind was moderate, and we carried our studding-sails. In the morning of the 23d,
we were in latitude of <geo select="lat" n="2">60° 27' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="2">45° 33' E</geo>. Snow showers continued, and the weather was
so cold, that the water in our water-vessels on deck had been frozen for several preceding
nights.</p><p>Having clear weather at intervals, I spread the ships a-breast four miles from each other, in
order the better to discover any thing that might lie in our way. We continued to sail in this
manner till <time>six o'clock  in the evening</time>, when hazy weather and snow showers made it necessary for us
to join.</p><p>We kept our course to N.E. till <time>eight o'clock  in the morning</time> of the 25th, when the wind having
veered round to N.E. by E., by the W. and N. we tacked, and stood to N.W. The wind was fresh, and
yet we made but little way against a high northerly sea. We now began to see some of that sort of
peterels so well known to sailors by the name of sheerwaters, latitude <geo select="lat">58° 10' S</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon">50° 54' E</geo>.
In the <time>afternoon</time> the wind veered to the southward of east; and at <time>eight o'clock  in the evening</time>, it
increased to a storm, attended with thick hazy weather, sleet and snow.</p><p>During night we went under our fore-sail and main-top-sail close-reefed: At day-light the next
morning, added to them the fore and mizen top-sails. At <time>four o'clock</time> it fell calm; but a prodigious
high sea from the N.E., and a complication of the worst of weather, viz. snow, sleet, and rain,
continued, together with the calm, till <time>nine o'clock  in the evening</time>. Then the weather cleared up,
and we got a breeze at S.E. by S. With this we steered N. by E. till <time>eight o'clock</time> the next morning,
being the 27th, when I spread the ships, and steered N.N.E., all sails set, having a fresh breeze at
S. by W., and clear weather.</p><p>At <time>noon</time> we were by observation, in the latitude of <geo select="lat">56° 28' S</geo>., and, about <time>three o'clock</time> in the
<time>afternoon</time>, the sun and moon appearing at intervals, their distances were observed by the following
persons; and the longitude resulting therefrom was,</p><p>By Mr Wales, (the mean of two sets) <geo select="lon">50° 59' E</geo>ast. Lieutenant Clerke 51 11 Mr Gilbert 50 14 Mr
Smith 50 50 Mr Kendal's watch 50 50 </p><p>At <time>six o'clock  in the evening</time>, being in latitude <geo select="lat">56° 9' S</geo>., I now made signal to the Adventure to
come under my stern; and at <time>eight o'clock</time> the next morning sent her to look out on my starboard
beam, having at this time a fresh gale at west and pretty clear weather. But this was not of long
duration; for, at two in the <time>afternoon</time>, the sky became cloudy and hazy, the wind increased to a
fresh gale, blew in squalls attended with snow, sleet, and drizzling rain. I now made signal to the
Adventure to come under my stern, and took another reef in each top-sail. At <time>eight o'clock</time> I hauled
up the main-sail, and run all night under the foresail, and two top-sails; our course being N.N.E.
and N.E. by N., with a strong gale at N.W.</p><p>The 29th, at <time>noon</time>, we observed in latitude <geo select="lat">52° 29' S</geo>., the weather being fair and tolerably
clear. But in the <time>afternoon</time>, it again became very thick and hazy with rain; and the gale increased
in such a manner as to oblige us to strike top-gallant yards, close-reef and hand the top-sails. We
spent part of the night, which was very dark and stormy, in making a tack to the S.W., and in the
morning of the 30th, stood again to the N.E., wind at N.W. and N., a very fresh gale; which split
several of our small sails. This day no ice was seen, probably owing to the thick hazy weather. At
<time>eight o'clock  in the evening</time> we tacked and stood to the westward, under our courses; but as the sea
run high, we made our course no better than S.S.W.</p><p>At <time>four o'clock</time> the next morning, the gale had a little abated; and the wind had backed to W. by
S. We again stood to the northward, under courses and double-reefed top-sails, having a very high
sea from the N.N.W., which gave us but little hopes of finding the land we were in search of. At
<time>noon</time> we were in the latitude of <geo select="lat">50° 56' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">56° 48' E</geo>., and presently after we saw two
islands of ice. One of these we passed very near, and found that it was breaking or falling to
pieces, by the cracking noise it made; which was equal to the report of a four-pounder. There was a
good deal of loose ice about it; and had the weather been favourable, I should have brought-to, and
taken some up. After passing this, we saw no more, till we returned again to the south.</p><p><date>1773 February</date></p><p>Hazy gloomy weather continued, and the wind remained invariably fixed at N.W., so that we could
make our course no better than N.E. by N., and this course we held till <time>four o'clock</time> in the
<time>afternoon</time> of the first of February. Being then in the latitude of <geo select="lat">48° 30' S</geo> , and longitude <geo select="lon">58° 7' E</geo>.,
nearly in the meridian of the island of Mauritius, and where we were to expect to find the land said
to be discovered by the French, of which at this time we saw not the least signs, we bore away
east.</p><p>I now made the signal to the Adventure to keep at the distance of four miles on my starboard
beam. At half an hour past six, Captain Furneaux made the signal to speak with me; and upon his
coming under my stern, he informed me that he had just seen a large float of sea or rock weed, and
about it several birds (divers.) These were certainly signs of the vicinity of land; but whether it
lay to the east or west, was not possible for us to know. My intention was to have got into this
latitude four or five degrees of longitude to the west of the meridian we were in, and then to have
carried on my researches to the east. But the west and north-west winds we had had the five
preceding days, prevented me from putting this in execution.</p><p>The continual high sea we had lately had from the N.E., N., N.W. and W., left me no reason to
believe that land of any extent lay to the West. We therefore continued to steer to the east, only
lying-to a few hours in the night, and in the morning resumed our course again, four miles north and
south from each other; the hazy weather not permitting us to spread farther. We passed two or three
small pieces of rock weed, and saw two or three birds known by the name of egg-birds; but saw no
other signs of land. At <time>noon</time> we observed in latitude <geo select="lat">48° 36' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">59° 35' E</geo>. As we could
only see a few miles farther to the south, and as it was not impossible that there might be land not
far off in that direction, I gave orders to steer S. 1/2 E., and made the signal for the Adventure
to follow, she being by this movement thrown a-stern: The weather continuing hazy till half an hour
past <time>six o'clock  in the evening</time>, when it cleared up so as to enable us to see about five leagues
round us.</p><p>Being now in the latitude of <geo select="lat">49° 13' S</geo>., without having the least signs of land, I wore and stood
again to the eastward, and soon after spoke with Captain Furneaux. He told me that he thought the
land was to the N.W. of us,; as he had, at one time, observed the sea to be smooth when the wind
blew in that direction. Athough this was not conformable to the remarks <emph rend="italic">we</emph> had made on the sea, I resolved to clear up the point, if the wind would admit of my
getting to the west in any reasonable time.</p><p>At <time>eight o'clock  in the morning</time> of the 3d, being in the latitude of <geo select="lat">48° 56' S</geo>. longitude <geo select="lon">60° 47'
E</geo>., and upwards of 8° to the east of the meridian of the Mauritius, I began to despair of finding
land to the east; and as the wind had now veered to the north, resolved to search for it to the
west. I accordingly tacked and stood to the west with a fresh gale. This increased in such a manner,
that, before night, we were reduced to our two courses; and, at last, obliged to lie-to under the
fore-sails, having a prodigious high sea from W.N.W., notwithstanding the height of the gale was
from N. by W. At <time>three o'clock</time> the next morning, the gale abating, we made sail, and continued to
ply to the west till <time>ten o'clock  in the morning</time> of the 6th.</p><p>At this time, being in the latitude of <geo select="lat">48° 6' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">58° 22' E</geo>., the wind seemingly fixed
at W.N.W., and seeing no signs of meeting with land, I gave over plying, and bore away east a little
southerly: Being satisfied, that if there is any land hereabout, it can only be an isle of no great
extent. And it was just as probable I might have found it to the E. as to the W.</p><p>While we were plying about here we took every opportunity to observe the variation of the
compass, and found it to be from 27° 50' to <geo select="lon">30° 26' W</geo>. Probably the mean of the two extremes, viz.
29° 4', is the nearest the truth, as it nearly agrees with the variation observed on board the
Adventure. In making these observations, we found that, when the sun was on the larboard side of the
ship, the variation was the least; and when on the starboard side, the greatest. This was not the
first time we had made this observation, without being able to account for it. At <time>four o'clock</time> in
the morning of the 7th, I made the Adventure's signal to keep at the distance of four miles on my
starboard beam; and continued to steer E.S.E. This being a fine day, I had all our men's bedding and
clothes spread on deck to air; and the ship cleaned and smoked betwixt decks. At <time>noon</time> I steered a
point more to the south, being then in the latitude of <geo select="lat">45° 49' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">61° 48' E</geo>. At <time>six
o'clock in the evening</time>, I called in the Adventure; and at the same time took several azimuths, which
gave the variation 31° 28'.W. These observations could not be taken with the greatest accuracy, on
account of the rolling of the ship, occasioned by a very high westerly swell.</p><p>The preceding evening, three Port Egmont hens were seen; this morning another appeared. In the
evening, and several times in the night, penguins were heard; and, at daylight in the morning of the
8th, several of these were seen; and divers of two sorts, seemingly such as are usually met with on
the coast of England. This occasioned us to sound, but we found no ground with a line of 210
fathoms. Our latitude now was <geo select="lat">49° 53' S</geo>., and longitude <geo select="lon">63° 39' E</geo>. This was at <time>eight o'clock</time>. By
this time the wind had veered round by the N.E. to E., blew a brisk gale, and was attended with hazy
weather, which soon after turned to a thick fog; and, at the same tine, the wind shifted to N.E.</p><p>I continued to keep the wind on the larboard tack, and to fire a gun every hour till <time>noon</time>; when I
made the signal to tack, and tacked accordingly. But, as neither this signal, nor any of the former,
was answered by the Adventure, we had but too much reason to think that a separation had taken
place; though we were at a loss to tell how it had been effected. I had directed Captain Furneaux,
in case he was separated from me, to cruise three days in the place where he last saw me. I
therefore continued making short boards, and firing half-hour guns, till the 9th in the <time>afternoon</time>,
when, the weather having cleared up, we could see several leagues round us, and found that the
Adventure was not within the limits of our horizon. At this time we were about two or three leagues
to the eastward of the situation we were in when we last saw her; and were standing to the westward
with a very strong gale at N.N.W., accompanied with a great sea from the same direction. This,
together, with an increase of wind, obliged us to lie-to till <time>eight o'clock</time> the next morning, during
which time we saw nothing of the Adventure, notwithstanding the weather was pretty clear, and we had
kept firing guns, and burning false fires, all night. I therefore gave over looking for her, made
sail, and steered S.E., with a very fresh gale at W. by N., accompanied with a high sea from the
same direction.</p><p>While we were beating about here; we frequently saw penguins and divers, which made us conjecture
the land was not far off; but in what direction it was not possible for us to tell. As we advanced
to the south, we lost the penguins, and most of the divers; and, as usual, met with abundance of
albatrosses, blue peterels, sheer-waters, &amp;c.</p><p>The 11th, at <time>noon</time>, and in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="1">51° 15' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">67° 20' E</geo>., we again met with
penguins: and saw an egg bird, which we also look upon to be a sign of the vicinity of land. I
continued to steer to the S.E., with a fresh gale in the north-west quarter, attended with a long
hollow swell, and frequent showers of rain, hail, and snow. The 12th, in the morning, being in the
latitude of <geo select="lat" n="2">52° 32' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="2">69° 47' E</geo>., the variation was 31° 38' W. In the evening, in the
latitude of <geo select="lat" n="3">53° 7' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="3">70° 50' E</geo>., it was 32° 33'; and, the next morning, in the latitude
of <geo select="lat" n="4">53° 37' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="4">72° 10' E</geo>, it was 33° 8' W. Thus far we had continually a great number of
penguins about the ship, which seemed to be different from those we had seen near the ice; being
smaller, with reddish bills and brownish heads. The meeting with so many of these birds, gave us
some hopes of finding land, and occasioned various conjectures about its situation. The great
westerly swell, which still continued, made it improbable that land of any considerable extent lay
to the west. Nor was it very probable that any lay to the north; as we were only about 160 leagues
to the south of Tasman's track in 1642; and I conjectured that Captain Furneaux would explore this
place; which accordingly happened. In the evening we saw a Port Egmont hen, which flew away in the
direction of N.E. by E., and the next morning a seal was seen; but no penguins. In the evening,
being in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="5">55° 49' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="5">75° 52' E</geo>., the variation was 34° 48' W., and, in the
evening of the 15th, in latitude <geo select="lat" n="6">57° 2' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="6">79° 56' E</geo>., it was 38° W. Five seals were seen
this day, and a few penguins; which occasioned us to sound, without finding any bottom, with a line
of 150 fathoms.</p><p>At day-light in the morning of the 16th, we saw an island of ice to the northward; for which we
steered, in order to take some on board; but the wind shifting to that direction, hindered us from
putting this in execution. At this time we were in the latitude of <geo select="lat">57° 8' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">80° 59' E</geo>.,
and had two islands of ice in sight. This morning we saw one penguin, which appeared to be of the
same sort which we had formerly seen near the ice. But we had now been so often deceived by these
birds, that we could no longer look upon them, nor indeed upon any other oceanic birds, which
frequent high latitudes, as sure signs of the vicinity of land.</p><p>The wind continued not long at north, but veered to E. by N.E., and blew a gentle gale, with
which we stood to the southward; having frequent showers of sleet and snow. But, in the night, we
had fair weather, and a clear serene sky; and, between midnight and <time>three o'clock  in the morning</time>,
lights were seen in the heavens, similar to those in the northern hemisphere, known by the name of
Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights; but I never heard of the Aurora Australia been seen before. The
officer of the watch observed that it sometimes broke out in spiral rays, and in a circular form;
then its light was very strong, and its appearance beautiful. He could not perceive it had any
particular direction; for it appeared, at various times, in different parts of the heavens, and
diffused its light throughout the whole atmosphere.</p><p>At nine in the morning, we bore down to an island of ice which we reached by <time>noon</time>. It was full
half a mile in circuit, and two hundred feet high at least, though very little loose ice about it.
But while we were considering whether or no we should hoist out our boats to take some up, a great
quantity broke from the island. Upon this we hoisted out our boats, and went to work to get some on
board. The pieces of ice, both great and small, which broke from the island, I observed, drifted
fast to the westward; that is, they left the island in that direction, and were, in a few hours,
spread over a large space of sea. This, I have no doubt, was caused by a current setting in that
direction. For the wind could have but little effect upon the ice; especially as there was a large
hollow swell from the west. This circumstance greatly retarded our taking up ice. We, however, made
a shift to get on board about nine or ten tons before <time>eight o'clock</time>, when we hoisted in the boats
and made sail to the east, inclining to the south, with a fresh gale at south; which, soon after,
veered to S.S.W. and S.W., with fair but cloudy weather. This course brought us among many ice
isles; so that it was necessary to proceed with great caution. In the night the mercury in the
thermometer fell two degrees below the freezing point; and the water in the scuttle casks on deck
was frozen. As I have not taken notice of the thermometer of late, I shall now observe, that, as we
advanced to the north, the mercury gradually rose to 45, and fell again, as we advanced to the
south, to what is above-mentioned; nor did it rise, in the middle of the day, to above 34 or 35.</p><p>In the morning of the 18th, being in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="1">57° 54' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">83° 14' E</geo>., the
variation was <geo select="lon">39° 33' W</geo>. In the evening, in latitude <geo select="lat" n="2">58° 2' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="2">84° 35' E</geo>., it was only
<geo select="lon">37° 8' W</geo>., which induced me to believe it was decreasing. But in the evening of the 20th, in the
latitude of <geo select="lat" n="3">58° 47' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="3">90° 56' E</geo>., I took nine azimuths, with Dr Knight's compass, which
gave the variation 40° 7', and nine others, with Gregory's, which gave <geo select="lon">40° 15' W</geo>.</p><p>This day, at <time>noon</time>, being nearly in the latitude and longitude just mentioned, we thought we saw
land to the S.W. The appearance was so strong that we doubted not it was there in reality, and
tacked to work up to it accordingly; having a light breeze at south, and clear weather. We were,
however, soon undeceived, by finding that it was only clouds; which, in the evening, entirely
disappeared, and left us a clear horizon, so that we could see a considerable way round us; in which
space nothing was to be seen but ice islands.</p><p>In the night the Aurora Australis made a very brilliant and luminous appearance. It was seen
first in the east, a little above the horizon; and, in a short time, spread over the whole
heavens.</p><p>The 21st, in the morning, having little wind and a smooth sea, two favourable circumstances for
taking up ice, I steered for the largest ice island before us, which we reached by <time>noon</time>. At this
time, we were in the latitude of <geo select="lat">59° S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">92° 30' E</geo>.; having about two hours before seen
three or four penguins. Finding here a good quantity of loose ice, I ordered two boats out, and sent
them to take some on board. While this was doing, the island, which was not less than half a mile in
circuit, and three or four hundred feet high above the surface of the sea, turned nearly bottom up.
Its height, by this circumstance, was neither increased nor diminished apparently. As soon as we had
got on board as much ice as we could dispose of, we hoisted in the boats, and made sail to the S.E.,
with a gentle breeze at N. by E., attended with showers of snow, and dark gloomy weather. At this
time we had but few ice islands in sight, but, the next day, seldom less than twenty or thirty were
seen at once.</p><p>The wind gradually veered to the east; and, at last, fixing at E. by S., blew a fresh gale. With
this we stood to the south, till <time>eight o'clock  in the evening</time> of the 23d; at which time we were in
the latitude of <geo select="lat">61° 52' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">95° 2' E</geo>. We now tacked and spent the night, which was
exceedingly stormy, thick, and hazy, with sleet and snow, in making short boards. Surrounded on
every side with danger, it was natural for us to wish for day-light. This, when it came, served only
to increase our apprehensions, by exhibiting to our view those huge mountains of ice, which in the
night we had passed without seeing.</p><p>These unfavourable circumstances, together with dark nights, at this advanced season of the year,
quite discouraged me from putting in execution a resolution I had taken of crossing the Antarctic
Circle once more. Accordingly, at <time>four o'clock  in the morning</time>, we stood to the north, with a very
hard gale at E.S.E., accompanied with snow and sleet, and a very high sea from the same point, which
made great destruction among the ice islands. This circumstance, far from being of any advantage to
us, greatly increased the number of pieces we had to avoid. The large pieces which break from the
ice islands, are much more dangerous than the islands themselves. The latter are so high out of
water, that we can generally see them, unless the weather be very thick and dark, before we are very
near them. Whereas the others cannot be seen in the night, till they are under the ship's bows.
These dangers were, however, now become so familiar to us, that the apprehensions they caused were
never of long duration; and were, in some measure, compensated both by the seasonable supplies of
fresh water these ice islands afforded us, (without which we must have been greatly distressed,) and
also by their very romantic appearance, greatly heightened by the foaming and dashing of the waves
into the curious holes and caverns which are formed in many of them; the whole exhibiting a view
which at once filled the mind with admiration and horror, and can only be described by the hand of
an able painter.</p><p>Towards the evening the gale abated, and in the night we had two or three hours calm. This was
succeeded by a light breeze at west, with which we steered east, under all the sail we could set,
meeting with many ice islands.</p><p>This night we saw a Port Egmont hen; and next morning, being the 25th, another. We had lately
seen but few birds; and those were albatrosses, sheer-waters, and blue peterels. It is remarkable
that we did not see one of either the white or Antarctic peterels, since we came last amongst the
ice. Notwithstanding the wind kept at W. and N.W. all day, we had a very high sea from the east, by
which we concluded that no land could be near in that direction. In the evening, being in the
latitude <geo select="lat">60° 51' S</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon">95° 41' E</geo>., the variation was 43° 6' W., and the next morning, being the
26th, having advanced about a degree and a half more to the east, it was 41° 30', both being
determined by several azimuths.</p><p>We had fair weather all the <time>afternoon</time>, but the wind was unsettled, veering round by the north to
the east. With this we stood to the S.E. and E., till <time>three o'clock</time> in the <time>afternoon</time>; when, being in
the latitude of <geo select="lat">61° 21' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">97° 7' E</geo>, we tacked and stood to the northward and eastward as
the wind kept veering to the south. This, in the evening, increased to a strong gale, blew in
squalls, attended with snow and sleet, and thick hazy weather, which soon brought us under our
close-reefed top-sails.</p><p>Between eight in the morning of the 26th, and <time>noon</time> the next day, we fell in among several islands
of ice; from whence such vast quantities had broken as to cover the sea all round us, and render
sailing rather dangerous. However, by <time>noon</time>, we were clear of it all. In the evening the wind abated,
and veered to S.W. but the weather did not clear up till the next morning, when we were able to
carry all our sails, and met with but very few islands of ice to impede us. Probably the late gale
had destroyed a great number of them. Such a very large hollow sea had continued to accompany the
wind as it veered from E. to S.W. that I was certain no land of considerable extent could lie within
100 or 150 leagues of our situation between these two points.</p><p>The mean height of the thermometer at <time>noon</time>, for some days past, was at about 35, which is
something higher than it usually was in the same latitude about a month or five weeks before,
consequently the air was something warmer. While the weather was really <emph rend="italic">warm</emph>, the gales were not only stronger, but more frequent, with almost continual misty,
dirty, wet weather. The very animals we had on board felt its effects. A sow having in the morning
farrowed nine pigs, every one of them was killed by the cold before <time>four o'clock</time> in the <time>afternoon</time>,
notwithstanding all the care we could take of them. From the same cause, myself as well as several
of my people, had fingers and toes chilblained. Such is the summer weather we enjoyed!</p><p><date>1773 March</date></p><p>The wind continued unsettled, veering from the south to the west, and blew a fresh gale till the
evening. Then it fell little wind, and soon after a breeze sprung up at north, which quickly veered
to N.E. and N.E. by E., attended with a thick fog, snow, sleet, and rain. With this wind and weather
we kept on to the S.E., till <time>four o'clock</time> in the <time>afternoon</time> of the next day, being the first of
March, when it fell calm, which continued for near twenty-four hours. We were now in the latitude of
<geo select="lat">60° 36' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">107° 54' E</geo>, and had a prodigious high swell from the S.W., and, at the same
time, another from the S. or S.S.E. The dashing of the one wave against the other, made the ship
both roll and pitch exceedingly; but at length the N.W. swell prevailed. The calm continued till
<time>noon</time> the next day, when it was succeeded by a gentle breeze from S.E., which afterwards increased
and veered to S.W. With this we steered N.E. by E., and E. by N., under all the sail we could
set.</p><p>In the <time>afternoon</time> of the 3d, being in latitude <geo select="lat">60° 13' S</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon">110° 18' E</geo>, the variation was 39°
4' W. But the observations, by which this was determined, were none of the best, being obliged to
make use of such as we could get, during the very few and short intervals when the sun appeared. A
few penguins were seen this day, but not so many islands of ice as usual. The weather was also
milder, though very changeable; thermometer from 36 to 38. We continued to have a N.W. swell,
although the wind was unsettled, veering to N.W. by the W. and N., attended with hazy sleet and
drizzling rain.</p><p>We prosecuted our course to the east, inclining to the south, till <time>three o'clock</time> in the <time>afternoon</time>
of the 4th, when, (being in the latitude of <geo select="lat">60° 37' S</geo> , longitude <geo select="lon">113° 24' E</geo>) the wind shifting at once
to S.W. and S.W. by S., I gave orders to steer E. by N. 1/2 N. But in the night we steered E. 1/2 S.
in order to have the wind, which was at S.S.W., more upon the beam, the better to enable us to stand
back, in case we fell in with any danger in the dark. For we had not so much time to spare to allow
us to lie-to.</p><p>In the morning of the 5th, we steered E. by N., under all the sail we could set, passing one ice
island and many small pieces, and at <time>nine o'clock</time> the wind, which of late had not remained long upon
any one point, shifted all at once to east, and blew a gentle gale. With this, we stood to the
north, at which time we were in the latitude of <geo select="lat">60° 44' S</geo>., and longitude <geo select="lon">116° 50' E</geo>. The latitude
was determined by the meridian altitude of the sun, which appeared, now and then, for a few minutes,
till three in the <time>afternoon</time>. Indeed the sky was, in general, so cloudy, and the weather so thick and
hazy, that we had very little benefit of sun or moon; very seldom seeing the face of either the one
or the other. And yet, even under these circumstances, the weather, for some days past, could not be
called very cold. It, however, had not the least pretension to be called summer weather, according
to my ideas of summer in the northern hemisphere, as far as 60° of latitude, which is nearly as far
north as I have been.</p><p>In the evening we had three islands of ice in sight, all of them large; especially one, which was
larger than any we had yet seen. The side opposed to us seemed to be a mile in extent; if so, it
could not be less than three in circuit. As we passed it in the night, a continual cracking was
heard, occasioned, no doubt, by pieces breaking from it. For, in the morning of the 6th, the sea,
for some distance round it, was covered with large and small pieces; and the island itself did not
appear so large as it had done the evening before. It could not be less than 100 feet high; yet such
was the impetuous force and height of the waves which were broken against it, by meeting with such a
sudden resistance, that they rose considerably higher. In the evening we were in latitude of <geo select="lat">59° 58' S</geo> 
S., longitude <geo select="lon">118° 39' E</geo>. The 7th, the wind was variable in the N.E. and S.E. quarters, attended
with snow and sleet till the evening. Then the weather became fair, the sky cleared up, and the
night was remarkably pleasant, as well as the morning of the next day; which, for the brightness of
the sky, and serenity and mildness of the weather, gave place to none we had seen since we left the
Cape of Good Hope. It was such as is little known in this sea; and to make it still more agreeable,
we had not one island of ice in sight. The mercury in the thermometer rose to 40. Mr Wales and the
master made some observations of the moon and stars, which satisfied us, that, when our latitude was
59° 44', our longitude was 121° 9'. At <time>three o'clock</time> in the <time>afternoon</time>, the calm was succeeded by a
breeze at S.E. The sky, at the same time, was suddenly obscured, and seemed to presage an
approaching storm, which accordingly happened. For, in the evening, the wind shifted to south, blew
in squalls, attended with sleet and rain, and a prodigious high sea. Having nothing to take care of
but ourselves, we kept two or three points from the wind, and run at a good rate to the E.N.E. under
our two courses, and close-reefed topsails.</p><p>The gale continued till the evening of the 10th. Then it abated; the wind shifted to the
westward; and we had fair weather, and but little wind, during the night; attended with a sharp
frost. The next morning, being in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="1">57° 56' S</geo> , longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">130° E</geo>, the wind shifted to N.E.,
and blew a fresh gale, with which we stood S.E., having frequent showers of snow and sleet, and a
long hollow swell from S.S.E. and S.E. by S. This swell did not go down till two days after the wind
which raised it had not only ceased to blow, but had shifted, and blown fresh at opposite points,
good part of the time. Whoever attentively considers this, must conclude, that there can be no land
to the south, but what must be at a great distance.</p><p>Notwithstanding so little was to be expected in that quarter, we continued to stand to the south
till <time>three o'clock  in the morning</time> of the 12th, when we were stopped by a calm; being then in the
latitude of <geo select="lat" n="1">58° 56' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">131° 26' E</geo>. After a few hours calm, a breeze sprung up at west,
with which we steered east. The S.S.E. swell having gone down, was succeeded by another from N.W. by
W. The weather continued mild all this day, and the mercury rose to 39-1/2. In the evening it fell
calm, and continued so till <time>three o'clock  in the morning</time> of the 13th, when we got the wind at E. and
S.E., a fresh breeze attended with snow and sleet. In the <time>afternoon</time> it became fair, and the wind
veered round to the S. and S.S.W. In the evening, being in the latitude of<geo select="lat" n="2"> 58° 59' S</geo> , longitude <geo select="lon" n="2">134° E</geo>,
the weather was so clear in the horizon, that we could see many leagues round us. We had but little
wind during the night, some showers of snow, and a very sharp frost. As the day broke, the wind
freshened at S.E. and S.S.E.; and soon after, the sky cleared up, and the weather became clear and
serene; but the air continued cold, and the mercury in the thermometer rose only one degree above
the freezing point.</p><p>The clear weather gave Mr Wales an opportunity to get some observations of the sun and moon.
Their results reduced to <time>noon</time>, when the latitude was <geo select="lat">58° 22' S</geo>., gave us <geo select="lon">136° 22' E</geo>. longitude. Mr
Kendal's watch at the same time gave 134° 42'; and that of Mr Arnold the same. This was the first
and only time they pointed out the same longitude since we left England. The greatest difference,
however, between them, since we left the Cape, had not much exceeded two degrees.</p><p>The moderate, and I might almost say, pleasant weather, we had, at times, for the last two or
three days, made me wish I had been a few degrees of latitude farther south; and even tempted me to
incline our course that way. But we soon had weather which convinced us that we were full far
enough; and that the time was approaching, when these seas were not to be navigated without enduring
intense cold; which, by the bye, we were pretty well used to. In the <time>afternoon</time>, the serenity of the
sky was presently obscured: The wind veered round by the S.W. to W., and blew in hard squalls,
attended with thick and heavy showers of hail and snow, which continually covered our decks, sails,
and rigging, till <time>five o'clock  in the evening</time> of the 15th. At this time, the wind abated, and
shifted to S.E.; the sky cleared up; and the evening was so serene and clear, that we could see many
leagues round us; the horizon being the only boundary to our sight.</p><p>We were now in the latitude of <geo select="lat">59° 17' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">140° 12' E</geo>., and had such a large hollow
swell from W.S.W., as assured us that we had left no land behind us in that direction. I was also
well assured that no land lay to the south on this side 60° of latitude. We had a smart frost during
the night, which was curiously illuminated with the southern lights.</p><p>At <time>ten o'clock  in the morning</time> of the 16th, (which was as soon as the sun appeared,) in the
latitude of <geo select="lat" n="1">58° 51' S</geo>., our longitude was <geo select="lon" n="1">144° 10' E</geo>. This good weather was, as usual, of short
duration. In the <time>afternoon</time> of this day, we had again thick snow showers; but, at intervals, it was
tolerably clear; and, in the evening being in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="2">58° 58' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="2">144° 37' E</geo>., I
found the variation by several azimuths to be 31' E.</p><p>I was not a little pleased with being able to determine, with so much precision, this point of
the Line, in which the compass has no variation. For I look upon half a degree as next to nothing;
so that the intersection of the latitude and longitude just mentioned, may be reckoned the point
without any sensible error. At any rate, the Line can only pass a very small matter west of it.</p><p>I continued to steer to the east, inclining to the south, with a fresh gale at S.W., till five
o'clock the next morning, when, being in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="1">59° 7' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">146° 53' E</geo>., I bore
away N.E., and, at <time>noon</time>, north, having come to a resolution to quit the high southern latitudes, and
to proceed to New Zealand to look for the Adventure, and to refresh my people. I had also some
thoughts, and even a desire to visit the east coast of Van Diemen's Land, in order to satisfy myself
if it joined the coast of New South Wales.</p><p>In the night of the 17th, the wind shifted to N.W., and blew in squalls, attended with thick hazy
weather and rain. This continued all the 18th, in the evening of which day, being in the latitude of
<geo select="lat" n="1">56° 15' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">150° E</geo>, the sky cleared up, and we found the variation by several azimuths to be
13° 30' E. Soon after, we hauled up, with the log, a piece of rock-weed, which was in a state of
decay, and covered with barnacles. In the night the southern lights were very bright.</p><p>The next morning we saw a seal; and towards <time>noon</time>, some penguins, and more rock-weed, being at
this time in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="1">55° 1' S</geo>,  longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">152° 1' E</geo>. In the latitude of <geo select="lat">54° 4' S</geo>,  we also saw a
Port Egmont hen, and some weed. Navigators have generally looked upon all these to be certain signs
of the vicinity of land; I cannot, however, support this opinion. At this time we knew of no land,
nor is it even probable that there is any, nearer than New Holland, or Van Diemen's Land, from which
we were distant 260 leagues. We had, at the same time, several porpoises playing about us; into one
of which Mr Cooper struck a harpoon; but as the ship was running seven knots, it broke its hold,
after towing it some minutes, and before we could deaden the ship's way.</p><p>As the wind, which continued between the north and the west, would not permit me to touch at Van
Diemen's Land, I shaped my course to New Zealand; and, being under no apprehensions of meeting with
any danger, I was not backward in carrying sail, as well by night as day, having the advantage of a
very strong gale, which was attended with hazy rainy weather, and a very large swell from the W. and
W.S.W. We continued to meet with, now and then, a seal, Port Egmont hens, and sea-weed.</p><p>On the morning of the 22d, the wind shifted to south, and brought with it fair weather. At <time>noon</time>,
we found ourselves in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="1">49° 55' S</geo> , longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">159° 28' E</geo>, having a very large swell out of
the S.W. For the three days past, the mercury in the thermometer had risen to 46, and the weather
was quite mild. Seven or eight degrees of latitude had made a surprising difference in the
temperature of the air, which we felt with an agreeable satisfaction.</p><p>We continued to advance to the N.E. at a good rate, having a brisk gale between the S. and E.;
meeting with seals, Port Egmont hens, egg birds, sea-weed, &amp;c. and having constantly a very
large swell from the S.W. At <time>ten o'clock  in the morning</time> of the 25th, the land of New Zealand was
seen from the mast-head; and at <time>noon</time>, from the deck; extending from N.E. by E. to E., distant ten
leagues. As I intended to put into Dusky Bay, or any other port I could find, on the southern part
of <emph rend="italic">Tavai Poenammoo</emph>, we steered in for the land, under all the sail we
could carry, having the advantage of a fresh gale at W., and tolerably clear weather. This last was
not of long duration; for, at half an hour after <time>four o'clock</time>, the land, which was not above four
miles distant, was in a manner wholly obscured in a thick haze. At this time, we were before the
entrance of a bay, which I had mistaken for Dusky Bay, being deceived by some islands that lay in
the mouth of it.</p><p>Fearing to run, in thick weather, into a place to which we were all strangers, and seeing some
breakers and broken ground a-head, I tacked in twenty-five fathom water, and stood out to sea with
the wind at N.W. This bay lies on the S.E. side of Cape West, and may be known by a white cliff on
one of the isles which lies in the entrance of the bay. This part of the coast I did not see, but at
a great distance, in my former voyage; and we now saw it under so many disadvantageous
circumstances, that the less I say about it, the fewer mistakes I shall make. We stood out to sea,
under close-reefed top-sails and courses, till <time>eleven o'clock</time> at night; when we wore and stood to
the northward, having a very high and irregular sea. At <time>five o'clock</time> next morning, the gale abated,
and we bore up for the land; at <time>eight o'clock</time>, the West Cape bore E. by N. 1/2 N., for which we
steered, and entered Dusky Bay about <time>noon</time>. In the entrance of it, we found 44 fathoms water, a sandy
bottom, the West Cape bearing S.S.E., and Five Fingers Point, or the north point of the bay, north.
Here we had a great swell rolling in from the S.W. The depth of water decreased to 40 fathoms,
afterwards we had no ground with 60. We were, however, too far advanced to return; and therefore
stood on, not doubting but that we should find anchorage. For in this bay we were all strangers; in
my former voyage, having done no more than discover and name it.</p><p>After running about two leagues up the bay, and passing several of the isles which lay in it, I
brought-to, and hoisted out two boats; one of which I sent away with an officer round a point on the
larboard hand to look for anchorage. This he found, and signified the same by signal. We then
followed with the ship, and anchored in 50 fathoms water, so near the shore as to reach it with an
hawser. This was on Friday the 26th of March, at three in the <time>afternoon</time>, after having been 117 days
at sea; in which time we had sailed 3600 leagues, without having once sight of land.</p><p>After such a long continuance at sea, in a high southern latitude, it is but reasonable to think
that many of my people must be ill of the scurvy. The contrary, however, happened. Mention hath
already been made of sweet wort being given to such as were scorbutic. This had so far the desired
effect, that we had only one man on board that could be called very ill of this disease; occasioned
chiefly, by a bad habit of body, and a complication of other disorders. We did not attribute the
general good state of health in the crew, wholly to the sweet wort, but to the frequent airing and
sweetening the ship by fires, &amp;c. We must also allow portable broth, and sour krout, to have had
some share in it. This last can never be enough recommended.</p><p>My first care, after the ship was moored, was to send a boat and people a- fishing; in the mean
time, some of the gentlemen killed a seal, (out of many that were upon a rock,) which made us a
fresh meal.</p></div><div type="chapter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N"><head><l part="N">CHAPTER IV.</l><l part="N"><emph rend="italic">Transactions in Dusky Bay, with an Account of several Interviews with the
Inhabitants.</emph></l></head><p><date>1773 March</date></p><p>As I did not like the place we had anchored in, I sent Lieutenant Pickersgill over to the S.E.
side of the bay, to search for a better; and I went myself to the other side, for the same purpose,
where I met with an exceedingly snug harbour, but nothing else worthy of notice. Mr Pickersgill
reported, upon his return, that he had found a good harbour, with every conveniency. As I liked the
situation of this, better than the other of my own finding, I determined to go there in the morning.
The fishing-boat was very successful; returning with fish sufficient for all hands for supper; and,
in a few hours in the morning, caught as many as served for dinner. This gave us certain hopes of
being plentifully supplied with this article. Nor did the shores and woods appear less destitute of
wild fowl; so that we hoped to enjoy with ease, what, in our situation, might be called the luxuries
of life. This determined me to stay some time in this bay, in order to examine it thoroughly; as no
one had ever landed before, on any of the southern parts of this country.</p><p>On the 27th, at <time>nine o'clock  in the morning</time>, we got under sail with a light breeze at S.W., and
working over to Pickersgill harbour, entered it by a channel scarcely twice the width of the ship;
and in a small creek, moored head and stern, so near the shore as to reach it with a brow or stage,
which nature had in a manner prepared for us in a large tree, whose end or top reached our gunwale.
Wood, for fuel and other purposes, was here so convenient, that our yards were locked in the
branches of the trees; and, about 100 yards from our stern, was a fine stream of freshwater. Thus
situated, we began to clear places in the woods, in order to set up the astronomer's observatory,
the forge to repair our iron-work, tents for the sail-makers and coopers to repair the sails and
casks in; to land our empty casks, to fill water, and to cut down wood for fuel; all of which were
absolutely necessary occupations. We also began to brew beer from the branches or leaves of a tree,
which much resembles the American black- spruce. From the knowledge I had of this tree, and the
similarity it bore to the spruce, I judged that, with the addition of inspissated juice of wort and
molasses, it would make a very wholesome beer, and supply the want of vegetables, which this place
did not afford; and the event proved that I was not mistaken.</p><p>Now I have mentioned the inspissated juice of wort, it will not be amiss, in this place, to
inform the reader, that I had made several trials of it since I left the Cape of Good Hope, and
found it to answer in a cold climate, beyond all expectation. The juice, diluted in warm water, in
the proportion of twelve parts water to one part juice, made a very good and well-tasted small-beer.
Some juice which I had of Mr Pelham's own preparing, would bear sixteen parts water. By making use
of warm-water, (which I think ought always to be done,) and keeping it in a warm place, if the
weather be cold, no difficulty will be found in fermenting it. A little grounds of either small or
strong-beer, will answer as well as yeast.</p><p>The few sheep and goats we had left were not likely to fare quite so well as ourselves; there
being no grass here, but what was coarse and harsh. It was, however not so bad, but that we expected
they would devour it with great greediness, and were the more surprised to find that they would not
taste it; nor did they seem over-fond of the leaves of more tender plants. Upon examination, we
found their teeth loose; and that many of them had every other symptom of an inveterate sea-scurvy.
Out of four ewes and two rams which I brought from the Cape, with an intent to put ashore in this
country, I had only been able to preserve one of each; and even these were in so bad a state, that
it was doubtful if they could recover, notwithstanding all the care possible had been taken of
them.</p><p>Some of the officers, on the 28th, went up the bay in a small boat on a shooting party; but,
discovering inhabitants, they returned before <time>noon</time>, to acquaint me therewith; for hitherto we had
not seen the least vestige of any. They had but just got aboard, when a canoe appeared off a point
about a mile from us, and soon after, returned behind the point out of sight, probably owing to a
shower of rain which then fell; for it was no sooner over, than the canoe again appeared, and came
within musket-shot of the ship. There were in it seven or eight people. They remained looking at us
for some time, and then returned; all the signs of friendship we could make did not prevail on them
to come nearer. After dinner I took two boats and went in search of them, in the cove where they
were first seen, accompanied by several of the officers and gentlemen. We found the canoe (at least
a-canoe) hauled upon the shore near to two small huts, where were several fire-places, some
fishing-nets, a few fish lying on the shore, and some in the canoe. But we saw no people; they
probably had retired into the woods. After a short stay, and leaving in the canoe some medals,
looking-glasses, beads, &amp;c. we embarked and rowed to the head of the cove, where we found
nothing remarkable. In turning back we put ashore at the same place as before; but still saw no
people. However, they could not be far off, as we smelled the smoke of fire, though we did not see
it. But I did not care to search farther, or to force an interview which they seemed to avoid; well
knowing that the way to obtain this, was to leave the time and place to themselves. It did not
appear that any thing I had left had been touched; however, I now added a hatchet, and, with the
night, returned on board.</p><p>On the 29th, were showers till the <time>afternoon</time>; when a party of the officers made an excursion up
the bay; and Mr Forster and his party were out botanizing. Both parties returned in the evening
without meeting with any thing worthy of notice; and the two following days, every one was confined
to the ship on account of rainy stormy weather.</p><p><date>1773 April</date></p><p>In the <time>afternoon</time> of the 1st of April, accompanied by several of the gentlemen, I went to see if
any of the articles I had left for the Indians were taken away. We found every thing remaining in
the canoe; nor did it appear that any body had been there since. After shooting some birds, one of
which was a duck, with a blue-grey plumage and soft bill, we, in the evening, returned on board.</p><p>The 2d, being a pleasant morning, Lieutenants Clerke and Edgecumbe, and the two Mr Forsters, went
in a boat up the bay to search for the productions of nature; and myself, Lieutenant Pickersgill,
and Mr Hodges, went to take a view of the N.W. side. In our way, we touched at the seal-rock, and
killed three seals, one of which afforded us much sport. After passing several isles, we at length
came to the most northern and western arms of the bay; the same as is formed by the land of Five
Fingers Point. In the bottom of this arm or cove, we found many ducks, wood-hens, and other wild
fowl, some of which we killed, and returned on board at <time>ten o'clock  in the evening</time>; where the other
party had arrived several hours before us, after having had but indifferent sport. They took with
them a black dog we had got at the Cape, who, at the first musket they fired, ran into the woods,
from whence he would not return. The three following days were rainy; so that no excursions were
made.</p><p>Early in the morning on the 6th, a shooting party, made up of the officers, went to Goose Cove,
the place where I was the 2d; and myself, accompanied by the two Mr Forsters, and Mr Hodges, set out
to continue the survey of the bay. My attention was directed to the north side, where I discovered a
fine capacious cove, in the bottom of which is a fresh-water river; on the west side several
beautiful small cascades; and the shores are so steep that a ship might lie near enough to convey
the water into her by a hose. In this cove we shot fourteen ducks, besides other birds, which
occasioned my calling it Duck Cove.</p><p>As we returned in the evening, we had a short interview with three of the natives, one man and
two women. They were the first that discovered themselves on the N.E. point of Indian Island, named
so on this occasion. We should have passed without seeing them, had not the man hallooed to us. He
stood with his club in his hand upon the point of a rock, and behind him, at the skirts of the wood,
stood the two women, with each of them a spear. The man could not help discovering great signs of
fear when we approached the rock with our boat. He however stood firm; nor did he move to take up
some things we threw him ashore. At length I landed, went up and embraced him; and presented him
with such articles as I had about me, which at once dissipated his fears. Presently after, we were
joined by the two women, the gentlemen that were with me, and some of the seamen. After this, we
spent about half an hour in chit-chat, little understood on either side, in which the youngest of
the two women bore by far the greatest share. This occasioned one of the seamen to say, that women
did not want tongue in any part of the world. We presented them with fish and fowl which we had in
our boat; but these they threw into the boat again, giving us to understand that such things they
wanted not. Night approaching, obliged us to take leave of them; when the youngest of the two women,
whose volubility of tongue exceeded every thing I ever met with, gave us a dance; but the man viewed
us with great attention. Some hours after we got on board, the other party returned, having had but
indifferent sport.</p><p>Next morning, I made the natives another visit, accompanied by Mr Forster and Mr Hodges, carrying
with me various articles which I presented them with, and which they received with a great deal of
indifference, except hatchets and spike-nails; these they most esteemed. This interview was at the
same place as last night; and now we saw the whole family, it consisted of the man, his two wives
(as we supposed), the young woman before mentioned, a boy about fourteen years old, and three small
children, the youngest of which was at the breast. They were all well-looking, except one woman, who
had a large wen on her upper-lip, which made her disagreeable; and she seemed, on that account, to
be in a great measure neglected by the man. They conducted us to their habitation, which was but a
little way within the skirts of the wood, and consisted of two mean huts made of the bark of trees.
Their canoe, which was a small double one, just large enough to transport the whole family from
place to place, lay in a small creek near the huts. During our stay, Mr Hodges made drawings of most
of them; this occasioned them to give him the name of <emph rend="italic">Toe-toe</emph>, which
word, we suppose signifies marking or painting. When we took leave, the chief presented me with a
piece of cloth or garment of their own manufacturing, and some other trifles. I at first thought it
was meant as a return for the presents I had made him; but he soon undeceived me, by expressing a
desire for one of our boat cloaks. I took the hint, and ordered one to be made for him of red baise,
as soon as I got aboard; where rainy weather detained me the following day.</p><p>The 9th, being fair weather, we paid the natives another visit, and made known our approach by
hallooing to them; but they neither answered us, nor met us at the shore as usual. The reason of
this we soon saw; for we found them at their habitations, all dressed and dressing, in their very
best, with their hair combed and oiled, tied up upon the crowns of their heads, and stuck with white
feathers. Some wore a fillet of feathers round their heads; and all of them had bunches of white
feathers stuck in their ears: Thus dressed, and all standing, they received us with great courtesy.
I presented the chief with the cloak I had got made for him, with which he seemed so well pleased,
that he took his pattapattou from his girdle and gave it me. After a short stay, we took leave; and
having spent the remainder of the day in continuing my survey of the bay, with the night returned on
board.</p><p>Very heavy rains falling on the two following days, no work was done; but the 12th proved clear
and serene, and afforded us an opportunity to dry our sails and linen; two things very much wanted;
not having had fair weather enough for this purpose since we put into this bay. Mr Forster and his
party also profited by the day in botanizing.</p><p>About <time>ten o'clock</time>, the family of the natives paid us a visit. Seeing that they approached the
ship with great caution, I met them in a boat, which I quitted when I got to them, and went into
their canoe. Yet, after all, I could not prevail on them to put along-side the ship, and at last was
obliged to leave them to follow their own inclination. At length they put ashore in a little creek
hard by us; and afterwards came and sat down on the shore a-breast of the ship, near enough to speak
with us. I now caused the bagpipes and fife to play, and the drum to beat. The two first they did
not regard; but the latter caused some little attention in them; nothing however could induce them
to come on board. But they entered, with great familiarity, into conversation (little understood)
with such of the officers and seamen as went to them, paying much greater regard to some than to
others; and these, we had reason to believe, they took for women. To one man in particular, the
young woman shewed an extraordinary fondness until she discovered his sex, after which she would not
suffer him to come near her. Whether it was that she before took him for one of her own sex, or that
the man, in order to discover himself, had taken some liberties with her which she thus resented, I
know not.</p><p>In the <time>afternoon</time>, I took Mr Hodges to a large cascade, which falls from a high mountain on the
south side of the bay, about a league above the place where we lay. He made a drawing of it on
paper, and afterwards painted it in oil colours; which exhibits, at once, a better description of it
than any I can give. Huge heaps of stones lay at the foot of this cascade, which had been broken off
and brought by the stream from the adjacent mountains. These stones were of different sorts; none
however, according to Mr Forster's opinion, (whom I believe to be a judge,) containing either
minerals or metals. Nevertheless, I brought away specimens of every sort, as the whole country, that
is, the rocky part of it, seemed to consist of those stones and no other. This cascade is at the
east point of a cove, lying in S.W. two miles, which I named Cascade Cove. In it is good anchorage
and other necessaries. At the entrance, lies an island, on each side of which is a passage; that on
the east side is much the widest. A little above the isle, and near the S.E. shore, are two rocks
which are covered at high water. It was in this cove we first saw the natives.</p><p>When I returned aboard in the evening, I found our friends, the natives, had taken up their
quarters at about a hundred yards from our watering- place; a very great mark of the confidence they
placed in us. This evening a shooting party of the officers went over to the north side of the bay,
having with them the small cutter to convey them from place to place.</p><p>Next morning, accompanied by Mr Forster, I went in the pinnace to survey the isles and rocks
which lie in the mouth of the bay. I began first with those which lie on the S.E. side of Anchor
Isle. I found here a very snug cove sheltered from all winds, which we called Luncheon Cove, because
here we dined on cray fish, on the side of a pleasant brook, shaded by the trees from both wind and
sun. After dinner we proceeded, by rowing, out to the outermost isles, where we saw many seals,
fourteen of which we killed and brought away with us; and might have got many more, if the surf had
permitted us to land with safety on all the rocks. The next morning, I went out again to continue
the survey, accompanied by Mr Forster. I intended to have landed again on the Seal Isles; but there
ran such a high sea that I could not come near them. With some difficulty we rowed out to sea, and
round the S.W. point of Anchor Isle. It happened very fortunately that chance directed me to take
this course, in which we found the sportsmen's boat adrift, and laid hold of her the very moment she
would have been dashed against the rocks. I was not long at a loss to guess how she came there, nor
was I under any apprehensions for the gentlemen that had been in her; and after refreshing ourselves
with such as we had to eat and drink, and securing the boat in a small creek, we proceeded to the
place where we supposed them to be. This we reached about seven or <time>eight o'clock  in the evening</time>, and
found them upon a small isle in Goose Cove, where, as it was low water, we could not come with our
boat until the return of the tide. As this did not happen till <time>three o'clock  in the morning</time>, we
landed on a naked beach, not knowing where to find a better place, and, after some time, having got
a fire and broiled some fish, we made a hearty supper, having for sauce a good appetite. This done,
we lay down to sleep, having a stony beach for a bed, and the canopy of heaven for a covering. At
length the tide permitted us to take off the sportsmen; and with them we embarked, and proceeded for
the place where we had left their boat, which, we soon reached, having a fresh breeze of wind in our
favour, attended with rain. When we came to the creek which was on the N.W. side of Anchor Isle, we
found there an immense number of blue peterels, some on the wing, others in the woods in holes in
the ground, under the roots of trees and in the crevices of rocks, where there was no getting them,
and where we supposed their young were deposited. As not one was to be seen in the day, the old ones
were probably, at that time, out at sea searching for food, which in the evening they bring to their
young. The noise they made was like the croaking of many frogs. They were, I believe, of the
broad-bill kind, which, are not so commonly seen at sea as the others. Here, however, they are in
great numbers, and flying much about in the night, some of our gentlemen at first took them for
bats. After restoring the sportsmen to their boat, we all proceeded for the ship, which we reached
by <time>seven o'clock  in the morning</time>, not a little fatigued with our expedition. I now learned that our
friends the natives returned to their habitation at night; probably foreseeing that rain was at
hand; which sort of weather continued the whole of this day.</p><p>On the morning of the 15th, the weather having cleared up and become fair, I set out with two
boats to continue the survey of the N.W. side of the bay, accompanied by the two Mr Forsters and
several of the officers, whom I detached in one boat to Goose Cove, where we intended to lodge the
night, while I proceeded in the other, examining the harbours and isles which lay in my way. In the
doing of this, I picked up about a score of wild fowl, and caught fish sufficient to serve the whole
party; and reaching the place of rendezvous a little before dark, I found all the gentlemen out
duck- shooting. They however soon returned, not overloaded with game. By this time, the cooks had
done their parts, in which little art was required; and after a hearty repast, on what the day had
produced, we lay down to rest; but took care to rise early the next morning, in order to have the
other bout among the ducks, before we left the cove.</p><p>Accordingly, at day-light, we prepared for the attack. Those who had reconnoitred the place
before, chose their stations accordingly; whilst myself and another remained in the boat, and rowed
to the head of the cove to start the game, which we did so effectually, that, out of some scores of
ducks, we only detained one to ourselves, sending all the rest down to those stationed below. After
this I landed at the head of the cove, and walked across the narrow isthmus that disjoins it from
the sea, or rather from another cove which runs in from the sea about one mile, and lies open to the
north winds. It, however, had all the appearance of a good harbour and safe anchorage. At the head
is a fine sandy beach, where I found an immense number of wood hens, and brought away ten couple of
them, which recompensed me for the trouble of crossing the isthmus, through the wet woods, up to the
middle in water. About <time>nine o'clock</time> we all got collected together, when the success of everyone was
known, which was by no means answerable to our expectations. The morning, indeed, was very
unfavourable for shooting, being rainy the most of the time we were out. After breakfast we set out
on our return to the ship, which we reached by <time>seven o'clock  in the evening</time>, with about seven dozen
of wild fowl, and two seals; the most of them shot while I was rowing about, exploring the harbours
and coves which I found in my way; every place affording something, especially to us, to whom
nothing came amiss.</p><p>It rained all the 17th, but the 18th bringing fair and clear weather, in the evening our friends,
the natives before-mentioned, paid us another visit; and, the next morning, the chief and his
daughter were induced to come on board, while the others went out in the canoe fishing. Before they
came on board I shewed them our goats and sheep that were on shore, which they viewed for a moment
with a kind of stupid insensibility. After this I conducted them to the brow; but before the chief
set his foot upon it to come into the ship, he took a small green branch in his hand, with which he
struck the ship's side several times, repeating a speech or prayer. When this was over, he threw the
branch into the main chains, and came on board. This custom and manner of making peace, as it were,
is practised by all the nations in the South Seas that I have seen.</p><p>I took them both down into the cabin, where we were to breakfast. They sat at table with us, but
would not taste any of our victuals. The chief wanted to know where we slept, and indeed to pry into
every corner of the cabin, every part of which he viewed with some surprise. But it was not possible
to fix his attention to any one thing a single moment. The works of art appeared to him in the same
light as those of nature, and were as far removed beyond his comprehension. What seemed to strike
them most was the number and strength of our decks, and other parts of the ship. The chief, before
he came aboard, presented me with a piece of cloth and a green talc hatchet; to Mr Forster he also
gave a piece or cloth; and the girl gave another to Mr Hodges. This custom of making presents before
they receive any, is common with the natives of the South Sea isles; but I never saw it practised in
New Zealand before. Of all the various articles I gave my guest, hatchets and spike-nails were the
most valuable in his eyes.</p><p>These he never would suffer to go out of his hands after he once laid hold of them; whereas many
other articles he would lay carelessly down any where, and at last leave them behind him.</p><p>As soon as I could get quit of them, they were conducted into the gun-room, where I left them,
and set out with two boats to examine the head of the bay; myself in one, accompanied by Mr Forster
and Mr Hodges, and Lieutenant Cooper in the other. We proceeded up the south side, and without
meeting with any thing remarkable, got to the head of the bay by sun-set; where we took up our
lodging for the night, at the first place we could land upon; for the flats hindered us from getting
quite to the head.</p><p>At day-light in the morning, I took two men in the small boat, and with Mr Forster went to take a
view of the flat land at the head of the bay, near to where we spent the night. We landed on one
side, and ordered the boat to meet us on the other side; but had not been long on shore before we
saw some ducks, which, by their creeping through the bushes, we got a shot at, and killed one. The
moment we had fired, the natives, whom we had not discovered before, set up a most hideous noise in
two or three places close by us. We hallooed in our turn; and, at the same time, retired to our
boat, which was full half a mile off. The natives kept up their clamouring noise, but did not follow
us. Indeed we found afterwards that they could not, because of a branch of the river between us and
them, nor did we find their numbers answerable to the noise they made. As soon as we got to our
boat, and found that there was a river that would admit us, I rowed in, and was soon after joined by
Mr Cooper in the other boat. With this reinforcement I proceeded up the river, shooting wild ducks,
of which there were great numbers; as we went along, now and then hearing the natives in the woods.
At length two appeared on the banks of the river, a man and a woman; and the latter kept waving
something white in her hand, as a sign of friendship. Mr Cooper being near them, I called to him to
land, as I wanted to take the advantage of the tide to get as high up as possible, which did not
much exceed half a mile, when I was stopped by the strength of the stream and great stones which lay
in the bed of the river.</p><p>On my return, I found that as Mr Cooper did not land when the natives expected him, they had
retired into the woods, but two others now appeared on the opposite bank. I endeavoured to have an
interview with them, but this I could not effect. For as I approached the shore, they always retired
farther into the woods, which were so thick as to cover them from our sight. The falling tide
obliged me to retire out of the river to the place where we had spent the night. There we
breakfasted, and afterwards embarked, in order to return on board; but, just as we were going, we
saw two men on the opposite shore, hallooing to us, which induced me to row over to them. I landed
with two others, unarmed; the two natives standing about 100 yards from the water-side, with each a
spear in his hand. When we three advanced, they retired; but stood when I advanced alone.</p><p>It was some little time before I could prevail upon them to lay down their spears. This, at last,
one of them did; and met me with a grass plant in his hand, one end of which he gave me to hold,
while he held the other. Standing in this manner, he began a speech, not one word of which I
understood, and made some long pauses, waiting, as I thought, for me to answer; for, when I spoke,
he proceeded. As soon as this ceremony was over, which was not long, we saluted each other. He then
took his hahou, or coat, from off his own back, and put it upon mine; after which peace seemed
firmly established. More people joining us did not in the least alarm them; on the contrary, they
saluted every one as he came up.</p><p>I gave to each a hatchet and a knife, having nothing else with me: Perhaps these were the most
valuable things I could give them, at least they were the most useful. They wanted us to go to their
habitation, telling us they would give us something to eat; and I was sorry that the tide and other
circumstances would not permit me to accept of their invitation. More people were seen in the skirts
of the wood, but none of them joined us: Probably these were their wives and children. When we took
leave they followed us to our boat; and, seeing the musquets lying across the stern, they made signs
for them to be taken away, which being done, they came alongside, and assisted us to launch her. At
this time it was necessary for us to look well after them, for they wanted to take away every thing
they could lay their hands upon, except the muskets. These they took care not to touch, being
taught, by the slaughter they had seen us make among the wild- fowl, to look upon them as
instruments of death.</p><p>We saw no canoes or other boats with them, two or three logs of wood tied together served the
same purpose, and were indeed sufficient for the navigation of the river, on the banks of which they
lived. There fish and fowl were in such plenty, that they had no occasion to go far for food; and
they have but few neighbours to disturb them. The whole number at this place, I believe, does not
exceed three families.</p><p>It was <time>noon</time> when we took leave of these two men, and proceeded down the north side of the bay,
which I explored in my way, and the isles that lie in the middle. Night, however, overtook us, and
obliged me to leave one arm unlooked into, and hasten to the ship, which we reached by eight
o'clock. I then learnt that the man and his daughter stayed on board the day before till <time>noon</time>; and
that having understood from our people what things were left in Cascade Cove, the place where they
were first seen, he sent and took them away. He and his family remained near us till today, when
they all went away, and we saw them no more; which was the more extraordinary, as he never left us
empty-handed. From one or another he did not get less than nine or ten hatchets, three or four times
that number of large spike-nails, besides many other articles. So far as these things may be counted
riches in New Zealand, he exceeds every man there; being, at this time, possessed of more hatchets
and axes than are in the whole country besides.</p><p>In the <time>afternoon</time> of the 21st, I went with a party out to the isles on seal- hunting. The surf ran
so high that we could only land in one place, where we killed ten. These animals served us for three
purposes; the skins we made use of for our rigging; the fat gave oil for our lamps; and the flesh we
eat. Their haslets are equal to that of a hog, and the flesh of some of them eats little inferior to
beef-steaks. The following day nothing worthy of notice was done.</p><p>In the morning of the 23d, Mr Pickersgill, Mr Gilbert, and two others, went to the Cascade Cove,
in order to ascend one of the mountains, the summit of which they reached by <time>two o'clock</time> in the
<time>afternoon</time>, as we could see by the fire they made. In the evening they returned on board, and
reported that inland, nothing was to be seen but barren mountains, with huge craggy precipices,
disjoined by valleys, or rather chasms, frightful to behold. On the southeast side of Cape West,
four miles out at sea, they discovered a ridge of rocks, on which the waves broke very high. I
believe these rocks to be the same we saw the evening we first fell in with the land.</p><p>Having five geese left out of those we brought from the Cape of Good Hope, I went with them next
morning to Goose Cove (named so on this account,) where I left them. I chose this place for two
reasons; first, here are no inhabitants to disturb them; and, secondly, here being the most food, I
make no doubt but that they will breed, and may in time spread over the whole country, and fully
answer my intention in leaving them. We spent the day shooting in and about the cove, and returned
aboard about <time>ten o'clock  in the evening</time>. One of the party shot a white hern, which agreed exactly
with Mr Pennant's description, in his British Zoology, of the white herns that either now are, or
were formerly, in England.</p><p>The 20th was the eighth fair day we had had successively; a circumstance, I believe, very
uncommon in this place, especially at this season of the year. This fair weather gave us an
opportunity to complete our wood and water, to overhaul the rigging, caulk the ship, and put her in
a condition for sea. Fair weather was, however, now at an end; for it began to rain this evening,
and continued without intermission till <time>noon</time> the next day, when we cast off the shore fasts, hove
the ship out of the creek to her anchor, and steadied her with an hawser to the shore.</p><p>On the 27th, hazy weather, with showers of rain. In the morning I set out, accompanied by Mr
Pickersgill and the two Mr Forsters, to explore the arm or inlet I discovered the day I returned
from the head of the bay. After rowing about two leagues up it, or rather down, I found it to
communicate with the sea, and to afford a better outlet for ships bound to the north than the one I
came in by. After making this discovery, and refreshing ourselves on broiled fish and wild fowl, we
set out for the ship, and got on board at <time>eleven o'clock</time> at night, leaving two arms we had
discovered, and which ran into the east, unexplored. In this expedition we shot forty- four birds,
sea-pies, ducks, &amp;c., without going one foot out of our way, or causing any other delay than
picking them up.</p><p>Having got the tents, and every other article on board on the 28th, we only now waited for a wind
to carry us out of the harbour, and through New Passage, the way I proposed to go to sea. Every
thing being removed from the shore, I set fire to the top-wood, &amp;c., in order to dry a piece of
the ground we had occupied, which, next morning, I dug up, and sowed with several sorts of garden
seeds. The soil was such as did not promise success to the planter; it was, however, the best we
could find. At two o clock in the <time>afternoon</time>, we weighed with a light breeze at S.W., and stood up
the bay for the New Passage. Soon after we had got through, between the east end of Indian Island
and the west end of Long Island, it fell calm, which obliged us to anchor in forty-three fathom
water, under the north side of the latter island.</p><p>In the morning of the 30th we weighed again with a light breeze at west, which, together with all
our boats a-head towing, was hardly sufficient to stem the current. For, after struggling till <time>six
o'clock in the evening</time>, and not getting more than five miles from our last anchoring-place, we
anchored under the north side of Long Island, not more than one hundred yards from the shore, to
which we fastened a hawser.</p><p><date>1773 May</date></p><p>At day-light next morning, May 1st, we got again under sail, and attempted to work to windward,
having a light breeze down the bay. At first we gained ground, but at last the breeze died away;
when we soon lost more than we had got, and were obliged to bear up for a cove on the north side of
Long Island, where we anchored in nineteen fathom water, a muddy bottom: In this cove we found two
huts not long since inhabited; and near them two very large fire-places or ovens, such as they have
in the Society Isles. In this cove we were detained by calms, attended with continual rain, till the
4th in the <time>afternoon</time>, when, with the assistance of a small breeze at south- west, we got the length
of the reach or passage leading to sea. The breeze then left us, and we anchored under the east
point, before a sandy beach, in thirty fathoms water; but this anchoring-place hath nothing to
recommend it like the one we came from, which hath every thing in its favour.</p><p>In the night we had some very heavy squalls of wind, attended with rain, hail, and snow, and some
thunder. Daylight exhibited to our view all the hills and mountains covered with snow. At two
o'clock in the <time>afternoon</time>, a light breeze sprung up at S.S.W., which, with the help of our boats,
carried us down the passage to our intended anchor-place, where, at <time>eight o'clock</time>, we anchored in
sixteen fathoms water, and moored with a hawser to the shore, under the first point on the starboard
side as you come in from sea, from which we were covered by the point.</p><p>In the morning of the 6th, I sent Lieutenant Pickersgill, accompanied by the two Mr Forsters, to
explore the second arm which turns in to the east, myself being confined on board by a cold. At the
same time I had every thing got up from between decks, the decks well cleaned and well aired with
fires; a thing that ought never to be long neglected in wet moist weather. The fair weather, which
had continued all this day, was succeeded in the night by a storm from north-west, which blew in
hard squalls, attended with rain, and obliged us to strike top-gallant and lower yards, and to carry
out another hawser to the shore. The bad weather continued the whole day and the succeeding night,
after which it fell calm with fair weather.</p><p>At seven in the morning, on the 8th, Mr Pickersgill returned, together with his companions, in no
very good plight, having been at the head of the arm he was sent to explore, which he judged to
extend in to the eastward about eight miles. In it is a good anchoring-place, wood, fresh water,
wild fowl, and fish. At <time>nine o'clock</time> I set out to explore the other inlet, or the one next the sea;
and ordered Mr Gilbert, the master, to go and examine the passage out to sea, while those on board
were getting every thing in readiness to depart. I proceeded up the inlet till <time>five o'clock</time> in the
<time>afternoon</time>, when bad weather obliged me to return before I had seen the end of it. As this inlet lay
nearly parallel with the sea-coast, I was of opinion that it might communicate with Doubtful
Harbour, or some other inlet to the northward. Appearances were, however, against this opinion, and
the bad weather hindered me from determining the point, although a few hours would have done it. I
was about ten miles up, and thought I saw the end of it: I found on the north side three coves, in
which, as also on the south side, between the main and the isles that lie four miles up the inlet,
is good anchorage, wood, water, and what else can be expected, such as fish and wild fowl: Of the
latter, we killed in this excursion, three dozen. After a very hard row, against both wind and rain,
we got on board about <time>nine o'clock</time> at night, without a dry thread on our backs.</p><p>This bad weather continued no longer than till the next morning, when it became fair, and the sky
cleared up. But, as we had not wind to carry us to sea, we made up two shooting parties; myself,
accompanied by the two Mr. Forsters and some others, went to the area I was in the day before; and
the other party to the coves and isles Mr Gilbert had discovered when he was out, and where he found
many wild fowl. We had a pleasant day, and the evening brought us all on board; myself and party met
with good sport; but the other party found little.</p><p>All the <time>forenoon</time> of the 10th, we had strong gales from the west, attended with heavy showers of
rain, and blowing in such flurries over high land, as made it unsafe for us to get under sail. The
<time>afternoon</time> was more moderate, and became fair; when myself, Mr Cooper, and some others, went out in
the boats to the rocks, which lie at this entrance of the bay, to kill seals. The weather was rather
unfavourable for this sport, and the sea ran high, so as to make landing difficult; we, however,
killed ten, but could only wait to bring away five, with which we returned on board.</p><p>In the morning of the 11th, while we were getting under sail, I sent a boat for the other five
seals. At <time>nine o'clock</time> we weighed with a light breeze at south-east, and stood out to sea, taking up
the boat in our way. It was <time>noon</time> before we got clear of the land; at which time we observed in 45°
34' 30" S.; the entrance of the bay bore S.E. by E., and Break-sea Isles (the outermost isles that
lie at the south point of the entrance of the bay,) bore S.S.E., distant three miles; the
southernmost point, or that of Five Fingers Point, bore south <geo select="lon">42° W</geo>., and the northernmost land
N.N.E. In this situation we had a prodigious swell from S.W., which broke with great violence on all

in such plenty as Dusky Bay, a short description of it, and of the adjacent country, may prove of
use to some future navigators, as well as acceptable to the curious reader. For although this
country be far remote from the present trading part of the world, we can, by no means, tell what use
future ages may make of the discoveries made in the present. The reader of this journal must already
know that there are two entrances to this bay. The south entrance is situated on the north side of
Cape West, in latitude <geo select="lat">45° 48' S</geo>. It is formed by the land of the Cape to the south, and Five
Fingers Point to the north. This point is made remarkable by several pointed rocks lying off it,
which, when viewed from certain situations, have some resemblance to the five fingers of a man's
hand; from whence it takes its name. The land of this point is still more remarkable by the little
similarity it bears to any other of the lands adjacent; being a narrow peninsula lying north and
south, of a moderate and equal height, and all covered with wood.</p><p>To sail into the bay by this entrance is by no means difficult, as I know of no danger but what
shews itself. The worst that attends it, is the depth of water, which is too great to admit of
anchorage, except in the coves and harbours, and very near the shores; and even, in many places,
this last cannot be done. The anchoring-places are, however, numerous enough, and equally safe and
commodious. Pickersgill Harbour, where we lay, is not inferior to any other bay, for two or three
ships: It is situated on the south shore abreast of the west end of Indian island; which island may
be known from the others by its greater proximity to that shore. There is a passage into the harbour
on both sides of the isle, which lies before it. The most room is on the upper or east side, having
regard to a sunken rock, near the main, abreast this end of the isle: Keep the isle close aboard,
and you will not only avoid the rock, but keep in anchoring-ground. The next place, on this side, is
Cascade Cove, where there is room for a fleet of ships, and also a passage in on either side of the
isle, which lies in the entrance, taking care to avoid a sunken rock which lies near the south- east
shore, a little above the isle. This rock, as well as the one in Pickersgill Harbour, may be seen at
half-ebb It must be needless to enumerate all the anchoring-places in this capacious bay.</p><p>The north entrance lies in the latitude of <geo select="lat">45° 38' S</geo>., and five leagues to the north of Five
Fingers Point. To make this entrance plain, it will be necessary to approach the shore within a few
miles, as all the land within and on each side is of considerable height. Its situation may,
however, be known at a greater distance, as it lies under the first craggy mountains which rise to
the north of the land of Five Fingers Point. The southernmost of these mountains is remarkable,
having at its summit two small hillocks. When this mountain bears S.S.E. you will be before the
entrance, on the south side of which are several isles. The westernmost and outermost is the most
considerable, both for height and circuit, and this I have called Break sea Isle, because it
effectually covers this entrance from the violence of the southwest swell, which the other entrance
is so much exposed to. In sailing in you leave this isle as well as all the others to the south. The
best anchorage is in the first or north arm, which is on the larboard hand going in, either in one
of the coves, or behind the isles that lie under the south-east shore.</p><p>The country is exceedingly mountainous, not only about Dusky Bay, but through all the southern
part of this western coast of Tavai Poenammoo. A prospect more rude and craggy is rarely to be met
with, for inland appears nothing but the summits of mountains of a stupendous height, and consisting
of rocks that are totally barren and naked, except where they are covered with snow. But the land
bordering on the sea-coast, and all the islands, are thickly clothed with wood, almost down to the
water's edge. The trees are of various kinds, such as are common to other parts of this country, and
are fit for the shipwright, house-carpenter, cabinet-maker, and many other uses. Except in the river
Thames, I have not seen finer timber in all New Zealand; both here and in that river, the most
considerable for size is the Spruce-tree, as we called it, from the similarity of its foliage to the
American spruce, though the wood is more ponderous, and bears a greater resemblance to the
pitch-pine. Many of these trees are from six to eight and ten feet in girt, and from sixty to eighty
or one hundred feet in length, large enough to make a main-mast for a fifty-gun ship.</p><p>Here are, as well as in all other parts of New Zealand, a great number of aromatic trees and
shrubs, most of the myrtle kind; but amidst all this variety, we met with none which bore fruit fit
to eat.</p><p>In many parts the woods are so over-run with supplejacks, that it is scarcely possible to force
one's way amongst them. I have seen several which were fifty or sixty fathoms long.</p><p>The soil is a deep black mould, evidently composed of decayed vegetables, and so loose that it
sinks under you at every step; and this may be the reason why we meet with so many large trees as we
do, blown down by the wind, even in the thickest part of the woods. All the ground amongst the trees
is covered with moss and fern, of both which there is a great variety; but except the flax or hemp
plant, and a few other plants, there is very little herbage of any sort, and none that was eatable,
that we found, except about a handful of water-cresses, and about the same quantity of cellery. What
Dusky Bay most abounds with is fish: A boat with six or eight men, with hooks and lines, caught
daily sufficient to serve the whole ship's company. Of this article the variety is almost equal to
the plenty, and of such kinds as are common to the more northern coast; but some are superior, and
in particular the cole fish, as we called it, which is both larger and finer flavoured than any I
had seen before, and was, in the opinion of most on board, the highest luxury the sea afforded us.
The shell-fish are, muscles, cockles, scallops, cray-fish, and many other sorts, all such as are to
be found in every other part of the coast. The only amphibious animals are seals: These are to be
found in great numbers about this bay on the small rocks and isles near the sea coast.</p><p>We found here five different kinds of ducks, some of which I do not recollect to have any where
seen before. The largest are as big as a Muscovy duck, with a very beautiful variegated plumage, on
which account we called it the Painted Duck; both male and female have a large white spot on each
wing; the head and neck of the latter is white, but all the other feathers as well as those on the
head and neck of the drake are of a dark variegated colour. The second sort have a brown plumage,
with bright green feathers in their wings, and are about the size of an English tame duck. The third
sort is the blue-grey duck, before mentioned, or the whistling duck, as some called them, from the
whistling noise they made. What is most remarkable in these is, that the end of their beaks is soft,
and of a skinny, or more properly, cartilaginous substance. The fourth sort is something bigger than
a teal, and all black except the drake, which has some white feathers in his wing. There are but few
of this sort, and we saw them no where but in the river at the head of the bay. The last sort is a
good deal like a teal, and very common, I am told, in England. The other fowls, whether belonging to
the sea and land, are the same that are to be found in common in other parts of this country, except
the blue peterel before-mentioned, and the water or wood-hens. These last, although they are
numerous enough here, are so scarce in other parts, that I never saw but one. The reason may be,
that, as they cannot fly, they inhabit the skirts of the woods, and feed on the sea-beach, and are
so very tame or foolish, as to stand and stare at us till we knocked them down with a stick. The
natives may have, in a manner, wholly destroyed them. They are a sort of rail, about the size and a
good deal like a common dunghill hen; most of them are of a dirty black or dark-brown colour, and
eat very well in a pye or fricassée. Among the small birds I must not omit to particularize the
wattle-bird, poy-bird, and fan-tail, on account of their singularity, especially as I find they are
not mentioned in the narrative of my former voyage.</p><p>The wattle-bird, so called, because it has two wattles under its beak as large as those of a
small dunghill-cock, is larger, particularly in length, than an English black-bird. Its bill is
short and thick, and its feathers of a dark lead colour; the colour of its wattles is a dull yellow,
almost an orange colour.</p><p>The poy-bird is less than the wattle-bird. The feathers of a fine mazarine blue, except those of
its neck, which are of a most beautiful silver-grey, and two or three short white ones, which are on
the pinion joint of the wing. Under its throat hang two little tufts of curled, snow-white leathers,
called its <emph rend="italic">poies</emph>, which being the Otaheitean word for earrings,
occasioned our giving that name to the bird, which is not more remarkable for the beauty of its
plumage than for the sweetness of its note. The flesh is also most delicious, and was the greatest
luxury the woods afforded us.</p><p>Of the fan-tail there are different sorts; but the body of the most remarkable one is scarcely
larger than a good filbert, yet it spreads a tail of most beautiful plumage, full three quarters of
a semi-circle, of at least four or five inches radius.</p><p>For three or four days after we arrived in Pickersgill harbour, and as we were clearing the woods
to set up our tents, &amp;c. a four-footed animal was seen by three or four of our people; but as no
two gave the same description of it, I cannot say of what kind it is. All, however, agreed, that it
was about the size of a cat, with short legs, and of a mouse colour. One of the seamen, and he who
had the best view of it, said it had a bushy tail, and was the most like a jackall of any animal he
knew. The most probable conjecture is, that it is of a new species. Be this as it may, we are now
certain that this country is not so destitute of quadrupeds as was once thought.</p><p>The most mischievous animals here are the small black sand flies, which are very numerous, and so
troublesome, that they exceed every thing of the kind I ever met with. Wherever they bite they cause
a swelling, and such an intolerable itching, that it is not possible to refrain from scratching,
which at last brings on ulcers like the small-pox.</p><p>The almost continual rains may be reckoned another evil attending this bay; though perhaps this
may only happen at this season of the year. Nevertheless, the situation of the country, the vast
height, and nearness of the mountains, seem to subject it to much rain at all times. Our people, who
were daily exposed to the rain, felt no ill effects from it; on the contrary, such as were sick and
ailing when we came in, recovered daily, and the whole crew soon became strong and vigorous, which
can only be attributed to the healthiness of the place, and the fresh provisions it afforded. The
beer certainly contributed not a little. As I have already observed, we at first made it of a
decoction of the spruce leaves; but finding that this alone made the beer too astringent, we
afterwards mixed with it an equal quantity of the tea plant (a name it obtained in my former voyage,
from our using it as tea then as we also did now,) which partly destroyed the astringency of the
other, and made the beer exceedingly palatable, and esteemed by every one on board. We brewed it in
the same manner as spruce-beer, and the process is as follows: First, make a strong decoction of the
small branches of the spruce and tea plants, by boiling them three or four hours, or until the bark
will strip with ease from off the branches; then take them out of the copper, and put in the proper
quantity of molasses, ten gallons of which is sufficient to make a ton, or two hundred and forty
gallons of beer; let this mixture just boil, then pot it into the casks, and to it add an equal
quantity of cold water, more or less, according to the strength of the decoction, or your taste:
When the whole is milk-warm, put in a little grounds of beer, or yeast, if you have it, or any thing
else that will cause fermentation, and in a few days the beer will be fit to drink. After the casks
have been brewed in two or three times the beer will generally ferment itself, especially if the
weather is warm. As I had inspissated juice of wort on board, and could not apply it to a better
purpose, we used it together with molasses or sugar, to make these two articles go farther. For of
the former I had but one cask, and of the latter little to spare for this brewing. Had I known how
well this beer would have succeeded, and the great use it was of to the people, I should have come
better provided. Indeed I was partly discouraged by an experiment made during my former voyage,
which did not succeed then, owing, as I now believe, to some mismanagement.</p><p>Any one, who is in the least acquainted with spruce pines, will find the tree which I have
distinguished by that name. There are three sorts of it; that which has the smallest leaves and
deepest colour, is the sort we brewed with; but doubtless all three might safely serve that purpose.
The tea-plant is a small tree or shrub, with five white petals, or flower- leaves, shaped like those
of a rose, having smaller ones of the same figure in the intermediate spaces, and twenty or more
filaments or threads. The tree sometimes grows to a moderate height, and is generally bare on the
lower part, with a number of small branches growing close together towards the top. The leaves are
small and pointed, like those of the myrtle; it bears a dry roundish seed-case, and grows commonly
in dry places near the shores. The leaves, as I have already observed, were used by many of us as
tea, which has a very agreeable bitter and flavour when they are recent, but loses some of both when
they are dried. When the infusion was made strong, it proved emetic to some in the same manner as
green tea.</p><p>The inhabitants of this bay are of the same race of people with those in the other parts of this
country, speak the same language, and observe nearly the same customs. These indeed seem to have a
custom of making presents before they receive any, in which they come nearer to the Otaheiteans than
the rest of their countrymen. What could induce three or four families (for I believe there are not
more) to separate themselves so far from the society of the rest of their fellow-creatures, is not
easy to guess. By our meeting with inhabitants in this place, it seems probable that there are
people scattered over all this southern island. But the many vestiges of them in different parts of
this bay, compared with the number that we actually saw, indicates that they live a wandering life;
and, if one may judge from appearances and circumstances, few as they are, they live not in perfect
amity, one family with another. For, if they did, why do they not form themselves into some society?
a thing not only natural to man, but observed even by the brute creation.</p><p>I shall conclude this account of Dusky Bay with some observations made and communicated to me by
Mr Wales. He found by a great variety of observations, that the latitude of his observatory at
Pickersgill Harbour, was 45° 47' 26" half south; and, by the mean of several distances of the moon
from the sun, that its longitude was <geo select="lon">106° 18' E</geo>., which is about half a degree less than it is laid
down in my chart constructed in my former voyage. He found the variation of the needle or compass,
by the mean of three different needles, to be <geo select="lon">13° 49' E</geo>, and the dip of the south end 70° 5' three
quarters. The times of high water, on the full and change days, he found to be at 10° 57', and the
tide to rise and fall, at the former eight feet, at the latter five feet eight inches. This
difference, in the rise of the tides between the new and full moon, is a little extraordinary, and
was probably occasioned at this time by some accidental cause, such as winds, &amp;c., but, be it as
it will, I am well assured there was no error in the observations.</p><p>Supposing the longitude of the observatory to be as above, the error of Mr Kendal's watch, in
longitude, will be 1° 48' minus, and that of Mr Arnold's 39° 25'. The former was found to be gaining
6",461 a-day on mean time, and the latter losing 99",361. Agreeably to these rates the longitude by
them was to be determined, until an opportunity of trying them again.</p><p>I must observe, that in finding the longitude by Mr Kendal's watch, we suppose it to have gone
mean time from the Cape of Good Hope. Had its cape rate been allowed, the error would not have been
so great.</p></div><div type="chapter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N"><head><l part="N">CHAPTER VI.</l><l part="N"><emph rend="italic">Passage from Dusky Bay to Queen Charlottes Sound, with an Account of some Water
Spouts, and of our joining the Adventure.</emph></l></head><p><date>1773 May</date></p><p>After leaving Dusky Bay, as hath been already mentioned, I directed my course along shore for
Queen Charlotte's Sound, where I expected to find the Adventure. In this passage we met with nothing
remarkable, or worthy of notice, till the 17th at <time>four o'clock</time> in the <time>afternoon</time>. Being then about
three leagues to the westward of Cape Stephens; having a gentle gale at west by south, and clear
weather, the wind at once flattened to a calm, the sky became suddenly obscured by dark dense
clouds, and seemed to forebode much wind. This occasioned as to clew up all our sails, and presently
after six water-spouts were seen. Four rose and spent themselves between us and the land; that is,
to the south-west of us, the fifth was without us, the sixth first appeared in the south-west, at
the distance of two or three miles at least from us. Its progressive motion was to the north-east,
not in a straight but in a crooked line, and passed within fifty yards of our stern, without our
feeling any of its effects. The diameter of the base of this spout I judged to be about fifty or
sixty feet; that is, the sea within this space was much agitated, and foamed up to a great height.
From this a tube, or round body, was formed, by which the water or air, or both, was carried in a
spiral stream up to the clouds. Some of our people said they saw a bird in the one near us, which
was whirled round like the fly of a jack, as it was carried upwards. During the time these spouts
lasted, we had now and then light puffs of wind from all points of the compass, with some few slight
showers of rain, which generally fell in large drops; and the weather continued thick and hazy for
some hours after, with variable light breezes of wind. At length the wind fixed in its old point,
and the sky resumed its former serenity. Some of these spouts appeared at times to be stationary;
and at other times to have a quick but very unequal progressive motion, and always in a crooked
line, sometimes one way and sometimes another; so that, once or twice, we observed them to cross one
another. From the ascending motion of the bird, and several other circumstances, it was very plain
to us that these spouts were caused by whirlwinds, and that the water in them was violently hurried
upwards, and did not descend from the clouds as I have heard some assert. The first appearance of
them is by the violent agitation and rising up of the water; and, presently after, you see a round
column or tube forming from the clouds above, which apparently descends till it joins the agitated
water below. I say apparently, because I believe it not to be so in reality, but that the tube is
already formed from the agitated water below, and ascends, though at first it is either too small or
too thin to be seen. When the tube is formed, or becomes visible, its apparent diameter increaseth
till it is pretty large; after that it decreaseth, and at last it breaks or becomes invisible
towards the lower part. Soon after the sea below resumes its natural state, and the tube is drawn,
by little and little, up to the clouds, where it is dissipated. The same tube would sometimes have a
vertical, and sometimes a crooked or inclined direction. The most rational account I have read of
water-spouts, is in Mr Falconer's Marine Dictionary, which is chiefly collected from the
philosophical writings of the ingenious Dr Franklin. I have been told that the firing of a gun will
dissipate them; and I am very sorry I did not try the experiment, as we were near enough, and had a
gun ready for the purpose; but as soon as the danger was past, I thought no more about it, being too
attentive in viewing these extraordinary meteors At the time this happened, the barometer stood at
29, 75, and the thermometer at 56.</p><p>In coming from Cape Farewell to Cape Stephens, I had a better view of the coast than I had when I
passed in my former voyage, and observed that about six leagues to the east of the first-mentioned
cape, is a spacious bay, which is covered from the sea by a low point of land. This is, I believe,
the same that Captain Tasman anchored in on <date>the 18th of December, 1642</date>, and by him called Murderer's
Bay, by reason of some of his men being killed by the natives. Blind Bay, so named by me in my
former voyage, lies to the S.E. of this, and seems to run a long way inland to the south; the sight,
in this direction, not being bounded by any land. The wind having returned to the west, as already
mentioned, we resumed our course to the east; and at day-light the next morning (being the 18th,) we
appeared off Queen Charlotte's Sound, where we discovered our consort the Adventure, by the signals
she made to us; an event which every one felt with an agreeable satisfaction. The fresh westerly
wind now died away, and was succeeded by light airs from the S. and S.W., so that we had to work in
with our boats a-head towing. In the doing of this we discovered a rock, which we did not see in my
former voyage. It lies in the direction of S. by E. 1/2 E., distant four miles from the outermost of
the Two Brothers, and in a line with the White Rocks, on with the middle of Long Island. It is just
even with the surface of the sea, and hath deep water all round it. At <time>noon</time>, Lieutenant Kemp of the
Adventure came on board; from whom I learnt that their ship had been here about six weeks. With the
assistance of a light breeze, our boats, and the tides, we at <time>six o'clock  in the evening</time>, got to an
anchor in Ship Cove, near the Adventure, when Captain Furneaux came on board, and gave me the
following account of his proceedings, from the time we parted to my arrival here.</p></div><div type="chapter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N"><head><l part="N">CHAPTER VII.</l><l part="N"><emph rend="italic">Captain Furneaux's Narrative, from the Time the two Ships were separated, to
their joining again in Queen Charlotte's Sound, with some Account of Van Diemen's Land.</emph></l></head><p><date>1773 February</date></p><p>On <date>the 7th of February, 1773</date>, in the morning, the Resolution being then about two miles a-head,
the wind shifting then to the westward, brought on a very thick fog; so that we lost sight of her.
We soon after heard a gun, the report of which we imagined to be on the larboard beam; we then
hauled up S.E., and kept firing a four-pounder every half hour, but had no answer, nor further sight
of her; then we kept the course we steered on before the fog came on. In the evening it began to
blow hard, and was at intervals more clear, but could see nothing of her, which gave us much
uneasiness. We then tacked and stood to the westward, to cruise in the place where we last saw her,
according to agreement, in case of separation; but next day came on a very heavy gale of wind and
thick weather, that obliged us to bring to, and thereby prevented us reaching the intended spot.
However, the wind coming more moderate, and the fog in some measure clearing away, we cruised as
near the place as we could get, for three days; when giving over all hopes of joining company again,
we bore away for winter quarters, distant fourteen hundred leagues, through a sea entirely unknown
and reduced the allowance of water to one quart per day.</p><p>We kept between the latitude of 52°  and <geo select="lat">53° S</geo>., had much westerly wind, hard gales, with squalls,
snow and sleet, with a long hollow sea from the S.W., so that we judged there is no land in that
quarter. After we reached the longitude of <geo select="lon">95° E</geo>., we found the variation decrease very fast.</p><p>On the 26th, at night, we saw a meteor of uncommon brightness in the N.N.W. It directed its
course to the S.W., with a very great light in the southern sky, such as is known to the northward
by the name of Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights. We saw the light for several nights running;
and, what is remarkable, we saw but one ice island after we parted company with the Resolution, till
our making land, though we were most of the time two or three degrees to the southward of the
latitude we first saw it in. We were daily attended by great numbers of sea birds, and frequently
saw porpoises curiously spotted white and black.</p><p><date>1773 March</date></p><p>On the 1st of March we were alarmed with the cry of land by the man at the mast-head, on the
larboard beam; which gave us great joy. We immediately hauled our wind and stood for it, but to our
mortification were disappointed in a few hours; for, what we took to be land, proved no more than
clouds, which disappeared as we sailed towards them. We then bore away, and directed our course
towards the land laid down in the charts by the name of Van Diemen's Land, discovered by Tasman in
1642, and laid down in the latitude <geo select="lat">44° S</geo>., and longitude <geo select="lon">140° E</geo>., and supposed to join to New
Holland.</p><p>On the 9th of March, having little wind and pleasant weather, about nine a. m. being then in the
latitude of <geo select="lat">43° 37' S</geo>. longitude, by lunar observation, <geo select="lon">145° 36' E</geo>., and by account <geo select="lon">143° 10' E</geo>. from
Greenwich, we saw the land bearing N.N.E., about eight or nine leagues distance. It appeared
moderately high, and uneven near the sea; the hills farther back formed a double land, and much
higher. There seemed to be several islands, or broken land, to the N.W., as the shore trenched; but
by reason of clouds that hung over them, we could not be certain whether they did not join to the
main. We hauled immediately up for it, and by <time>noon</time> were within three or four leagues of it. A point
much like the Ramhead off Plymouth, which I take to be the same that Tasman calls South Cape, bore
north four leagues off us. The land from this cape runs directly to the eastward; about four leagues
along shore are three islands about two miles long, and several rocks, resembling the Mewstone,
(particularly one which we so named,) about four or five leagues E.S.E 1/2 E. off the above cape,
which Tasman has not mentioned, or laid down in his draughts. After you pass these islands, the land
lies E. by N., and W. by S., by the compass nearly. It is a bold shore, and seems to afford several
bays or anchoring-places, but believe deep water. From the S.W. cape, which is in the latitude of
<geo select="lat" n="1">43° 39' S</geo>., and longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">145° 50' E</geo>. to the S.E. cape, in the latitude <geo select="lat" n="2">43° 36' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="2">147°
E</geo>., is nearly sixteen leagues, and sounding from forty-eight to seventy fathoms, sand and broken
shells three or four leagues off shore. Here the country is hilly and full of trees, the shore rocky
and difficult landing, occasioned by the wind blowing here continually from the westward, which
occasions such a surf that the sand cannot lie on the shore. We saw no inhabitants here.</p><p>The morning, on the 10th of March, being calm, the ship then about four miles from the land, sent
the great cutter on shore with the second lieutenant, to find if there was any harbour or good bay.
Soon after, it beginning to blow very hard, made the signal for the boat to return several times,
but they did not see or hear any thing of it; the ship then three or four leagues off, that we could
not see any thing of the boat, which gave us great uneasiness, as there was a very great sea. At
half-past one p.m. to our great satisfaction, the boat returned on board safe. They landed, but with
much difficulty, and saw several places where the Indians had been, and one they lately had left,
where they had a fire, with a great number of pearl escallop shells round it, which shells they
brought on board, with, some burnt sticks and green boughs. There was a path from this place,
through the woods, which in all probability leads to their habitations; but, by reason of the
weather, had not time to pursue it. The soil seems to be very rich; the country well clothed with
wood, particularly on the lee side of the hills; plenty of water which falls from the rocks in
beautiful cascades, for two or three hundred feet perpendicular into the sea; but they did not see
the least sign of any place to anchor in with safety. Hoisted in the boat, and made sail for
Frederick Henry Bay. From <time>noon</time> to three p.m. running along shore E. by N., at which time we were
abreast of the westernmost point of a very deep bay, called by Tasman, Stormy Bay. From the west to
the east point of this bay there are several small islands, and black rocks, which we called the
Friars. While crossing this bay we had very heavy squalls and thick weather; at times, when it
cleared up, I saw several fires in the bottom of the bay, which is near two or three leagues deep,
and has, I doubt not, good places for anchoring, but the weather being so bad, did not think it safe
to stand into it. From the Friars the land trenches away about N. by E. four leagues: We had smooth
water, and kept in shore, having regular soundings from twenty to fifteen fathoms water. At
half-past six we hauled round a high bluff point, the rocks whereof were like so many fluted
pillars, and had ten fathoms water, fine sand, within half a mile of the shore. At seven, being
abreast of a fine bay, and having little wind, we came-to, with the small bower, in twenty-four
fathoms, sandy bottom. Just after we anchored, being a fine clear evening, had a good observation of
the star Antares and the moon, which gave the longitude of <geo select="lon">147° 34' E</geo>., being in the latitude of<geo select="lat">43° 
20' S</geo>. We first took this bay to be that which Tasman called Frederick Henry Bay; but afterwards
found that his is laid down five leagues to the northward of this.</p><p>At day-break the next morning, I sent the master in shore to sound the bay, and to find out a
watering-place; at eight he returned, having found a most excellent harbour, clear ground from side
to side, from eighteen to five fathom water all over the bay, gradually decreasing as you go in
shore. We weighed and turned up into the bay; the wind being westerly, and very little of it, which
baffled us much in getting in. At <time>seven o'clock  in the evening</time>, we anchored in seven fathoms water,
with a small bower, and moored with the coasting anchor to the westward, the north point of the bay
N.N.E. 1/2 E. (which we take to be Tasman's Head), and the easternmost point (which we named Penguin
Island, from a curious one we caught there) N.E. by E 3/4 E.; the watering-place W. 1/2 N.; about
one mile from the shore on each side; Maria's Island, which is about five or six leagues off, shut
in with both points; so that you are quite land-locked in a most spacious harbour.</p><p>We lay here five days, which time was employed in wooding and watering (which is easily got), and
over-hauling the rigging. We found the country very pleasant; the soil a black, rich, though thin
one; the sides of the hills covered with large trees, and very thick, growing to a great height
before they branch off. They are all of the evergreen kind, different from any I ever saw; the wood
is very brittle, and easily split; there is a very little variety of sorts, having seen but two. The
leaves of one are long and narrow; and the seed (of which I got a few) is in the shape of a button,
and has a very agreeable smell. The leaves of the other are like the bay, and it has a seed like the
white thorn, with an agreeable spicy taste and smell. Out of the trees we cut down for fire-wood,
there issued some gum, which the surgeon called gum-lac. The trees are mostly burnt or scorched,
near the ground, occasioned by the natives setting fire to the under-wood, in the most frequented
places; and by these means they have rendered it easy walking. The land birds we saw, are a bird
like a raven; some of the crow kind, black, with the tips of the feathers of the tail and wings
white, their bill long and very sharp; some paroquets; and several kinds of small birds. The
sea-fowl are ducks, teal, and the sheldrake. I forgot to mention a large white bird, that one of the
gentlemen shot, about the size of a large kite of the eagle kind. As for beasts, we saw but one,
which was an opossom; but we observed the dung of some, which we judged to be of the deer kind. The
fish in the bay are scarce; those we caught were mostly sharks, dog-fish, and a fish called by the
seamen nurses, like the dog-fish, only full of small white spots; and some small fish not unlike
sprats. The lagoons (which are brackish) abound with trout, and several other sorts of fish, of
which we caught a few with lines, but being much encumbered with stumps of trees, we could not haul
the seine.</p><p>While we lay here, we saw several smokes and large fires, about eight or ten miles in shore to
the northward, but did not see any of the natives; though they frequently come into this bay, as
there were several wigwams or huts, where we found some bags and nets made of grass, in which I
imagine they carry their provisions and other necessaries. In one of them there was the stone they
strike fire with, and tinder made of bark, but of what tree could not be distinguished. We found in
one of their huts, one of their spears, which was made sharp at one end, I suppose, with a shell or
stone. Those things we brought away, leaving in the room of them medals, gun- flints, a few nails,
and an old empty barrel with the iron hoops on it. They seem to be quite ignorant of every sort of
metal. The boughs, of which their huts are made, are either broken or split, and tied together with
grass in a circular form, the largest end stuck in the ground, and the smaller parts meeting in a
point at the top, and covered with fern and bark, so poorly done, that they will hardly keep out a
shower of rain. In the middle is the fire-place, surrounded with heaps of muscle, pearl, scallop,
and cray-fish shells, which I believe to be their chief food, though we could not find any of them.
They lie on the ground, on dried grass, round the fire; and I believe they have no settled place of
habitation (as their houses seemed built only for a few days), but wander about in small parties
from place to place in search of food, and are actuated by no other motive. We never found more than
three or four huts in a place, capable of containing three or four persons each only; and what is
remarkable, we never saw the least marks either of canoe or boat, and it is generally thought they
have none; being altogether, from what we could judge, a very ignorant and wretched set of people,
though natives of a country capable of producing every necessary of life, and a climate the finest
in the world. We found not the least signs of any minerals or metals.</p><p>Having completed our wood and water, we sailed from Adventure Bay, intending to coast it up along
shore, till we should fall in with the land seen by Captain Cook, and discover whether Van Diemen's
Land joins with New Holland. On the 16th, we passed Maria's Islands, so named by Tassman; they
appear to be the same as the main land. On the 17th, having passed Shouten's Islands, we hauled in
for the main land, and stood along shore at the distance of two or three leagues off. The country
here appears to be very thickly inhabited, as there was a continual fire along shore as we sailed.
The land hereabouts is much pleasanter, low, and even; but no signs of a harbour or bay, where a
ship might anchor with safety. The weather being bad, and blowing hard at S.S.E., we could not send
a boat on shore to have any intercourse with the inhabitants. In the latitude of <geo select="lat">40° 50' S</geo>., the
land trenches away to the westward, which I believe forms a deep bay, as we saw from the deck
several smokes arising a-back of the islands that lay before it, when we could not see the least
signs of land from the mast head.</p><p>From the latitude of <geo select="lat">40° 50' S</geo>., to the latitude of <geo select="lat">39° 50' S</geo>., is nothing but islands and
shoals; the land high, rocky, and barren. On the 19th, in the latitude of <geo select="lat">40° 30' S</geo>., observing
breakers about half a mile within shore of us, we sounded, and finding but eight fathoms,
immediately hauled off, deepened our water to fifteen fathoms, then bore away and kept along shore
again. From the latitude of <geo select="lat">39° 50' S</geo>  to <geo select="lat">39° S</geo>., we saw no land, but had regular soundings from
fifteen to thirty fathoms. As we stood on to the northward, we made land again in about 39°; after
which we discontinued our northerly course, as we found the ground very uneven, and shoal-water some
distance off. I think it a very dangerous shore to fall in with.</p><p>The coast, from Adventure Bay to the place where we stood away for New Zealand, lies in the
direction S. 1/2 W., and N. 1/2 E., about seventy-five leagues; and it is my opinion that there are
no straits between New Holland and Van Diemen's Land, but a very deep bay.—I should have stood
farther to the northward, but the wind blowing strong at S.S.E., and looking likely to haul round to
the eastward, which would have blown right on the land, I therefore thought it more proper to leave
the coast and steer for New Zealand.</p><p>After we left Van Diemen's Land, we had very uncertain weather, with rain and very heavy gusts of
wind. On the 24th, we were surprised with a very severe squall, that reduced us from top-gallant
sails to reefed courses, in the space of an hour. The sea rising equally quick, we shipped many
waves, one of which stove the large cutter, and drove the small one from her lashing in the waist;
and with much difficulty we saved her from being washed overboard. This gale lasted twelve hours,
after which we had more moderate weather, intermixed with calms. We frequently hoisted out the boats
to try the currents, and in general found a small drift to the W.S.W. We shot many birds; and had,
upon the whole, good weather; but as we got near to the land, it came on thick and dirty for several
days, till we made the coast of New Zealand in <geo select="lat">40° 30' S</geo>., having made twenty-four degrees of
longitude, from Adventure Bay, after a passage of fifteen days.</p><p>We had the winds much southerly in this passage, and I was under some apprehensions of not being
able to fetch the straits, which would have obliged us to steer away for George's Island; I would
therefore advise any who sail to this part, to keep to the southward, particularly in the fall of
the year, when the S. and S.E. winds prevail.</p><p><date>1773 April</date></p><p>The land, when we first made it, appeared high, and formed a confused jumble of hills and
mountains. We steered along shore to the northward, but were much retarded in our course by reason
of the swell from the N.E. At <time>noon</time>, on the 3rd of April, Cape Farewell, which is the south point of
the entrance of the west side of the straits, bore E. by N. 1/2 N. by the compass, three or four
leagues distant. About <time>eight o'clock</time> we entered the straits, and steered N.E. till midnight; then
brought-to till day-light, and had soundings from forty-five to fifty-eight fathoms, sand and broken
shells. At day-light, made sail and steered S.E. by E.; had light airs; Mount Egmont N.N.E. eleven
or twelve leagues, and Point Stephens S.E. 1/2 E. seven leagues. At <time>noon</time>, Mount Egmont N. by E.
twelve leagues; Stephens Island S.E. five leagues. In the <time>afternoon</time> we put the dredge over-board in
sixty-five fathoms; but caught nothing except a few small scallops, two or three oysters, and broken
shells.</p><p>Standing to the eastward for Charlotte's Sound, with a light breeze at N.W., in the morning on
the 5th, Stephens Island bearing S.W. by W. four leagues, we were taken a-back with a strong
easterly gale, which obliged us to haul our wind to the S.E. and work to windward up under Port
Jackson. The course from Stephens Island to Point Jackson, is nearly S.E. by the compass, eleven
leagues distant, depth of water from forty to thirty-two fathoms, sandy ground. As we stood off and
on, we fired several guns, but saw no signs of any inhabitants. In the <time>afternoon</time>, at half-past two,
o'clock, finding the tide set the ship to the westward, we anchored with the coasting anchor in
thirty-nine fathoms water, muddy ground; Point Jackson S.E. 1/2 E. three leagues; the east point of
an inlet (about four leagues to the westward of Point Jackson, and which appears to be a good
harbour) S.W. by W. 1/2 W. At eight p.m. the tide slackening, we weighed and made sail (having while
at anchor caught several fish with hook and line), and found the tide to run to the westward, at the
rate of two and a half knots per hour. Standing to the east, we found no ground at seventy fathoms,
off Point Jackson N.N.W., two leagues. At eight the next morning, had the sound open; but the wind
being down, it obliged us to work up under the western shore, as the tide sets up strong there, when
it runs down in mid channel. At ten, the tide being done, was obliged to come-to with the best bower
in thirty-eight fathoms, close to some white rocks, Point Jackson bearing N.W. 1/2 N.; the
northernmost of the Brothers E. by S.; and the middle of Entry Island (which lies on the north side
of the straits) N.E. We made <geo select="lon">15° 30' E</geo>., variation in the straits. As we sailed up the sound we saw
the tops of high mountains covered with snow, which remains all the year. When the tide slackened,
we weighed and sailed up the sound; and about <time>five o'clock</time> on the 7th, anchored in Ship Cove, in ten
fathoms water, muddy ground, and moored the best bower to the N.N.E., and small to S.S.W. In the
night, we heard the howling of dogs, and people hallooing on the east shore.</p><p>The two following days were employed in clearing a place on Motuara Island for erecting our tents
for the sick (having then several on board much afflicted with the scurvy), the sail-makers and
coopers. On the top of the island was a post erected, by the Endeavour's people, with her name and
time of departure on it.</p><p>On the 9th, we were visited by three canoes with about sixteen of the natives; and to induce them
to bring us fish and other provisions, we gave them several things, with which they seemed highly
pleased. One of our young gentlemen seeing something wrapt up in a better manner than common, had
the curiosity to examine what it was; and to his great surprise found it to be the head of a man
lately killed. They were very apprehensive of its being forced from them; and particularly the man
who seemed most interested in it, whose very flesh crept on his bones, for fear of being punished by
us, as Captain Cook had expressed his great abhorrence of this unnatural act. They used every method
to conceal the head, by shifting it from one to another; and by signs endeavouring to convince us,
that there was no such thing amongst them, though we had seen it but a few minutes before. They then
took their leave of us, and went on shore.</p><p>They frequently mentioned Tupia, which was the name of the native of George's Island (or
Otaheite), brought here by the Endeavour, and who died at Batavia; and when we told them he was
dead, some of them seemed to be very much concerned, and, as well as we could understand them,
wanted to know whether we killed him, or if he died a natural death. By these questions, they are
the same tribe Captain Cook saw. In the <time>afternoon</time>, they returned again with fish and fern roots,
which they sold for nails and other trifles; though the nails are what they set the most value on.
The man and woman who had the head, did not come off again. Having a catalogue of words in their
language, we called several things by name, which surprised them greatly. They wanted it much, and
offered a great quantity of fish for it.</p><p>Next morning, they returned again, to the number of fifty or sixty, with their chief at their
head (as we supposed), in five double canoes. They gave us their implements of war, stone hatchets,
and clothes, &amp;c. for nails and old bottles, which they put a great value on. A number of the
head men came on board us, and it was with some difficulty we got them out of the ship by fair
means; but on the appearance of a musket with a fixed bayonet, they all went into their canoes very
quickly. We were daily visited by more or less, who brought us fish in great plenty for nails,
beads, and other trifles, and behaved very peaceably.</p><p>We settled the astronomer with his instruments, and a sufficient guard, on a small island, that
is joined to Motuara at low water, called the Hippa, where there was an old fortified town that the
natives had forsaken. Their houses served our people to live in; and, by sinking them about a foot
inside, we made them very comfortable. Having done this, we struck our tents on the Motuara, and
having removed the ship farther into the cove on the west shore, moored her for the winter. We then
erected our tents near the river or watering-place, and sent ashore all the spars and lumber off the
decks, that they might be caulked; and gave her a winter coat to preserve the hull and rigging.</p><p><date>1773 May</date></p><p>On the 11th of May, we felt two severe shocks of an earthquake, but received no kind of damage.
On the 17th, we were surprised by the people firing guns on the Hippa, and having sent the boat, as
soon as she opened the sound, had the pleasure of seeing the Resolution off the mouth of it. We
immediately sent out the boats to tow her in, it being calm. In the evening she anchored about a
mile without us; and next morning weighed and warped within us. Both ships felt uncommon joy at our
meeting, after an absence of fourteen weeks.</p></div><div type="chapter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N"><head><l part="N">CHAPTER VIII.</l><l part="N"><emph rend="italic">Transactions in Queen Charlotte's Sound, with some Remarks on the
Inhabitants.</emph></l></head><p><date>1773 May</date></p><p>Knowing that scurvy-grass, celery, and other vegetables, were to be found in this sound, I went
myself the morning after my arrival, at day-break, to look for some, and returned on board at
breakfast with a boat-load. Being now satisfied, that enough was to be got for the crews of both
ships, I gave orders that they should be boiled, with wheat and portable broth, every morning for
breakfast; and with peas and broth for dinner; knowing from experience, that these vegetables, thus
dressed, are extremely beneficial, in removing all manner of scorbutic complaints.</p><p>I have already mentioned a desire I had of visiting Van Diemen's Land, in order to inform myself
if it made a part of New Holland; and I certainly should have done this, had the winds proved
favourable. But as Captain Furneaux had now, in a great measure, cleared up that point, I could have
no business there; and therefore came to a resolution to continue our researches to the east,
between the latitudes of 41° and 46°. I acquainted Captain Furneaux therewith, and ordered him to
get his ship in readiness to put to sea as soon as possible.</p><p>In the morning of the 20th, I sent ashore, to the watering-place near the Adventure's tent, the
only ewe and ram remaining, of those which I brought from the Cape of Good Hope, with an intent to
leave them in this country. Soon after I visited the several gardens Captain Furneaux had caused to
be made and planted with various articles; all of which were in a flourishing state, and, if
attended to by the natives, may prove of great utility to them. The next day I set some men to work
to make a garden on Long Island, which I planted with garden seeds, roots, &amp;c.</p><p>On the 22d in the morning, the ewe and ram, I had with so much care and trouble brought to this
place, were both found dead, occasioned, as was supposed, by eating some poisonous plant. Thus my
hopes of stocking this country with a breed of sheep, were blasted in a moment. About <time>noon</time>, we were
visited, for the first time since I arrived, by some of the natives, who dined with us; and it was
not a little they devoured. In the evening they were dismissed with presents.</p><p>Early in the morning of the 24th, I sent Mr Gilbert the master to sound about the rock we had
discovered in the entrance of the sound. Myself, accompanied by Captain Furneaux and Mr Forster,
went in a boat to the west bay on a shooting party. In our way, we met a large canoe in which were
fourteen or fifteen people. One of the first questions they asked was for Tupia, the person I
brought from Otaheite on my former voyage; and they seemed to express some concern when we told them
he was dead. These people made the same enquiry of Captain Furneaux when he first arrived; and, on
my return to the ship in the evening, I was told that a canoe had been along- side, the people in
which seemed to be strangers, and who also enquired for Tupia. Late in the evening Mr Gilbert
returned, having sounded all round the rock, which he found to be very small and steep.</p><p>Nothing worthy of notice happened till the 29th, when several of the natives made us a visit, and
brought with them a quantity of fish, which they exchanged for nails, &amp;c. One of these people I
took over to Motuara, and shewed him some potatoes planted there by Mr Fannen, master of the
Adventure. There seemed to be no doubt of their succeeding; and the man was so well pleased with
them, that he, of his own accord, began to hoe the earth up about the plants. We next took him to
the other gardens, and shewed him the turnips, carrots, and parsnips; roots which, together with the
potatoes, will be of more real use to them than all the other articles we had planted. It was easy
to give them an idea of these roots, by comparing them with such as they knew.</p><p>Two or three families of these people now took up their abode near us, employing themselves daily
in fishing, and supplying us with the fruits of their labour; the good effects of which we soon
felt. For we were, by no means, such expert fishers as they are; nor were any of our methods of
fishing equal to theirs.</p><p><date>1773 June</date></p><p>On the 2d of June, the ships being nearly ready to put to sea, I sent on shore on the east side
of the sound, two goats, male and female. The former was something more than a year old; but the
latter was much older. She had two fine kids, some time before we arrived in Dusky Bay, which were
killed by cold, as hath been already mentioned. Captain Furneaux also put on shore, in Cannibal
Cove, a boar and two breeding sows; so that we have reason to hope this country will in time be
stocked with these animals, if they are not destroyed by the natives before they become wild; for,
afterwards, they will be in no danger. But as the natives knew nothing of their being left behind,
it may be some time before they are discovered.</p><p>In our excursion to the east, we met with the largest seal I had ever seen. It was swimming on
the surface of the water, and suffered us to come near enough to fire at it; but without effect;
for, after a chase of near an hour, we were obliged to leave it. By the size of this animal, it
probably was a sea-lioness. It certainly bore much resemblance to the drawing in Lord Anson's
voyage; our seeing a sea-lion when we entered this sound, in my former voyage, increaseth the
probability; and I am of opinion, they have their abode on some of the rocks, which lie in the
strait, or off Admiralty Bay.</p><p>On the 3d, I sent a boat with the carpenter over to the east side of the sound, to cut down some
spars which we were in want of. As she was returning, she was chased by a large double canoe full of
people; but with what intent is not known. Early the next morning, some of our friends brought us a
large supply of fish. One of them agreed to go away with us; but afterwards, that is, when it came
to the point, he changed his mind; as did some others who had promised to go with the Adventure.</p><p>It was even said that some of them offered their children to sale. I however found that this was
a mistake. The report first took its rise on board the Adventure, where they were utter strangers to
their language and customs. It was very common for these people to bring their children with them,
and present them to us, in expectation that we would make them presents; this happened to me the
preceding morning. A man brought his son, a boy about nine or ten years of age, and presented him to
me. As the report of selling their children was then current, I thought, at first, that he wanted me
to buy the boy. But at last I found that he wanted me to give him a white shirt, which I accordingly
did. The boy was so fond of his new dress, that he went all over the ship, presenting himself before
every one that came in his way. This freedom used by him offended Old Will, the ram goat, who gave
him a butt with his horns, and knocked him backward on the deck. Will would have repeated his blow,
had not some of the people come to the boy's assistance. The misfortune, however, seemed to him
irreparable. The shirt was dirtied, and he was afraid to appear in the cabin before his father,
until brought in by Mr Forster; when he told a very lamentable story against goury the great dog
(for so they call all the quadrupeds we had aboard), nor could he be reconciled, till his shirt was
washed and dried. This story, though extremely trifling in itself, will shew how liable we are to
mistake these people's meaning, and to ascribe to them customs they never knew even in thought.</p><p>About <time>nine o'clock</time>, a large double canoe, in which were twenty or thirty people, appeared in
sight. Our friends on board seemed much alarmed, telling us that these were their enemies. Two of
them, the one with a spear, and the other with a stone-hatchet in his hand, mounted the arm- chests
on the poop, and there, in a kind of bravado, bid those enemies defiance; while the others, who were
on board, took to their canoe and went ashore, probably to secure the women and children.</p><p>All I could do, I could not prevail on the two that remained to call these strangers along-side;
on the contrary, they were displeased at my doing it, and wanted me to fire upon them. The people in
the canoe seemed to pay very little regard to those on board, but kept advancing slowly towards the
ship, and after performing the usual ceremonies, put along-side. After this the chief was easily
prevailed upon to come on board, followed by many others, and peace was immediately established on
all sides. Indeed, it did not appear to me that these people had any intention to make war upon
their brethren. At least, if they had, they were sensible enough to know, that this was neither the
time nor place for them to commit hostilities.</p><p>One of the first questions these strangers asked, was for Tupia; and when I told them he was
dead, one or two expressed their sorrow by a kind of lamentation, which to me appeared more formal
than real. A trade soon commenced between our people and them. It was not possible to hinder the
former from selling the clothes from off their backs for the merest trifles, things that were
neither useful nor curious. This caused me to dismiss the strangers sooner than I would have done.
When they departed, they went to Motuara, where, by the help of our glasses, we discovered four or
five canoes, and several people on the shore. This induced me to go over in my boat, accompanied by
Mr Forster and one of the officers. We were well received by the chief and the whole tribe, which
consisted of between ninety and a hundred persons, men, women, and children, having with them six
canoes, and all their utensils; which made it probable that they were come to reside in this sound.
But this is only conjecture; for it is very common for them, when they go but a little way, to carry
their whole property with them; every place being alike, if it affords them the necessary
subsistence; so that it can hardly be said they are ever from home. Thus we may easily account for
the emigration of those few families we found in Dusky Bay.</p><p>Living thus dispersed in small parties, knowing no head but the chief of the family or tribe,
whose authority may be very little, they feel many inconveniences, to which well-regulated
societies, united under one head or any other form of government, are not subject. These form laws
and regulations for their general good; they are not alarmed at the appearance of every stranger;
and, if attacked or invaded by a public enemy, have strong-holds to retire to, where they can with
advantage defend themselves, their property, and their country. This seems to be the state of most
of the inhabitants of Eahei-nomauwe; whereas those of Tavai-poenammoo, by living a wandering life in
small parties, are destitute of most of these advantages, which subjects them to perpetual alarms.
We generally found them upon their guard, travelling and working, as it were with their arms in
their hands. Even the women are not exempted from bearing arms, as appeared by the first interview I
had with the family in Dusky Bay; where each of the two women was armed with a spear, not less than
18 feet in length.</p><p>I was led into these reflections, by not being able to recollect the face of any one person I had
seen here three years ago: Nor did it once appear, that any one of them had the least knowledge of
me, or of any person with me that was here at that time. It is therefore highly probable that the
greatest part of the people which inhabited this sound in the beginning of the year 1770, have been
since driven out of it, or have, of their own accord, removed somewhere else. Certain it is, that
not one third of the inhabitants were here now, that were then. Their stronghold on the point of
Motuara hath been long deserted; and we found many forsaken habitations in all parts of the sound.
We are not, however, wholly to infer from this, that this place hath been once very populous; for
each family may, for their own convenience, when they move from place to place, have more huts than
one or two.</p><p>It may be asked, if these people had never seen the Endeavour, nor any of her crew, how could
they become acquainted with the name of Tupia, or have in their possession (which many of them had)
such articles, as they could only have got from that ship? To this it may be answered, that the name
of Tupia was so popular among them when the Endeavour was here, that it would be no wonder if, at
this time, it was known over great part of New Zealand, and as familiar to those who never saw him,
as to those who did. Had ships, of any other nation whatever, arrived here, they would have equally
enquired of them for Tupia. By the same way of reasoning, many of the articles left here by the
Endeavour, may be now in possession of those who never saw her. I got from one of the people, now
present, an ear ornament, made of glass very well formed and polished. The glass they must have got
from the Endeavour.</p><p>After passing about an hour on Motuara with these people, and having distributed among them some
presents, and shewed to the chief the gardens we had made, I returned on board, and spent the
remainder of our royal master's birth-day in festivity; having the company of Captain Furneaux and
all his officers. Double allowance enabled the seamen to share in the general joy.</p><p>Both ships being now ready for sea, I gave Captain Furneaux an account in writing of the route I
intended to take; which was to proceed to the east, between the latitudes of 41° and <geo select="lat">46° S</geo>., until I
arrived in the longitude of 140° or <geo select="lon">135° W</geo>., then, provided no land was discovered; to proceed to
Otaheite; from thence back to this place, by the shortest route; and after taking in wood and water,
to proceed to the south, and explore all the unknown parts of the sea between the meridian of New
Zealand and Cape Horn. Therefore, in case of separation before we reached Otaheite, I appointed that
island for the place of rendezvous, where he was to wait till the 20th of August: If not joined by
me before that time, he was then to make the best of his way back to Queen Charlotte's Sound, where
he was to wait until the 20th of November: After which (if not joined by me,) he was to put to sea,
and carry into execution their lordships' instructions.</p><p>Some may think it an extraordinary step in me to proceed on discoveries as far south at 46°
degrees of latitude, in the very depth of winter. But though it most be owned, that winter is by no
means favourable for discoveries, it nevertheless appeared to me necessary that something should be
done in it, in order to lessen the work I was upon; lest I should not be able to finish the
discovery of the southern part of the South Pacific Ocean the ensuing summer. Besides, if I should
discover any land in my route to the east, I should be ready to begin, with the summer, to explore
it. Setting aside all these considerations, I had little to fear; having two good ships well
provided; and healthy crews. Where then could I spend my time better? If I did nothing more, I was
at least in hopes of being able to point out to posterity, that these seas may be navigated, and
that it is practicable to go on discoveries; even in the very depth of winter.</p><p>During our stay in the sound, I had observed that this second visit made to this country, had not
mended the morals of the natives of either sex. I had always looked upon the females of New Zealand
to be more chaste than the generality of Indian women. Whatever favours a few of them might have
granted to the people in the Endeavour, it was generally done in a private manner, and the men did
not seem to interest themselves much in it. But now, I was told, they were the chief promoters of a
shameful traffic, and that for a spike-nail, or any other thing they value, they would oblige the
women to prostitute themselves, whether they would or no; and even without any regard to that
privacy which decency required.</p><p>During our stay here, Mr Wales lost no opportunity to observe equal altitudes of the sun, for
obtaining the rates of the watches. The result of his labours proved, that Mr Kendal's was gaining
9", 5 per day, and Mr Arnold's losing 94", 15s per day, on mean time.</p></div><div type="chapter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N"><head><l part="N">CHAPTER IX.</l><l part="N"><emph rend="italic">Route from New Zealand to Otaheite, with an Account of some low Islands,

seven weighed and put to sea, with the Adventure in company. We had no sooner got out of the sound,
than we found the wind at south, so that we had to ply through the straits. About <time>noon</time> the tide of
ebb setting out in our favour, made our boards advantageous; so that, at <time>five o'clock</time> in the
evening. Cape Palliser, on the island of Eahei-nomauwe, bore S.S.E. 1/2 S., and Cape Koamaroo, or
the S.E. point of the sound, N. by W. 3/4 W.; presently after it fell calm, and the tide of flood
now making against us, carried us at a great rate back to the north. A little before high-water, the
calm was succeeded by a breeze from the north, which soon increased to a brisk gale. This, together
with the ebb, carried us by <time>eight o'clock</time> the next morning quite through the strait. Cape Palliser
at this time bore E.N.E., and at <time>noon</time> N. by W. distant seven leagues.</p><p>This day at <time>noon</time>, when we attended the winding-up of the watches, the fusee of Mr Arnold's would
not turn round, so that after several unsuccessful trials we were obliged to let it go down.</p><p>After getting clear of the straits, I directed my course S.E. by E., having a gentle gale, but
variable between the north and west. The late S.E. winds having caused a swell from the same
quarter, which did not go down for some days, we had little hopes of meeting with land in that
direction. We however continued to steer to the S.E., and on the 11th crossed the meridian of 180°,
and got into the west longitude, according to my way of reckoning.</p><p>On the 16th, at seven in the morning, the wind having veered round to S.E., we tacked and
stretched to N.E., being at this time in the latitude of <geo select="lat">47° 7' S</geo>,  longitude <geo select="lon">173° W</geo>. In this situation
we had a great swell from N.E.</p><p>The wind continued at S.E. and S.S.E., blew fresh at intervals, and was attended with sometimes
fair, and at other times rainy weather, till the 20th, on which day, being in the latitude of<geo select="lat">44° 
30' S</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon">165° 45' W</geo>., the wind shifted to the west, blew a gentle gale, and was attended with
fair weather. With this we steered E. by N., E. by S., and E., till the 23d at <time>noon</time>, when, being in
the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="1">44° 38' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">161° 27' W</geo>., we had a few hours calm. The calm was succeeded
by a wind at east, with which we stood to the north. The wind increased and blew in squalls,
attended with rain, which at last brought us under our courses; and at <time>two o'clock</time> in the <time>afternoon</time>
of the next day, we were obliged to lie-to under the foresail, having a very hard gale from E.N.E.,
and a great sea from the same direction.</p><p>At <time>seven o'clock  in the morning</time> of the 25th, the gale being more moderate, we made sail under the
courses, and in the <time>afternoon</time> set the top-sails close-reefed. At midnight, the wind having veered
more to the north, we tacked and stretched to the S.E., being at this time in the latitude of<geo select="lat">42° 
53' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">163° 20' W</geo>.</p><p>We continued to stretch to the S.E., with a fresh gale and fair weather, till <time>four o'clock</time> in the
<time>afternoon</time> of the next day, when we stood again to the N.E., till midnight between the 27th and 28th.
Then we had a few hours calm, which was succeeded by faint breezes from the west. At this time we
were in the latitude of <geo select="lat">42° 32' S</geo> , longitude <geo select="lon">161° 15' W</geo>. The wind remained not long at west, before it
veered back to the E. by the N., and kept between the S.E. and N.E., but never blew strong.</p><p><date>1773 July</date></p><p>On July 2d, being in the latitude of <geo select="lat">53° 3' S</geo>,  longitude <geo select="lon">156° 17' W</geo>., we had again a calm, which
brought the wind back to the west; but it was of no longer continuance than before. For the next day
it returned to the E. and S.E., blew fresh at times, and by squalls, with rain.</p><p>On the 7th, being in the latitude of <geo select="lat">41° 22' S</geo> , longitude <geo select="lon">156° 12' W</geo>., we had two hours calm; in
which time Mr Wales went on board the Adventure to compare the watches, and they were found to
agree, allowing for the difference of their rates of going: A probable, if not a certain proof, that
they had gone well since we had been in this sea.</p><p>The calm was succeeded by a wind from the south; between which point and the N.W., it continued
for the six succeeding days, but never blew strong. It was, however, attended with a great hollow
swell from the S.W. and W., a sure indication that no large land was near in those directions. We
now steered east, inclining to the south, and on the 10th, in the latitude of <geo select="lat">43° 39' S</geo> , longitude
<geo select="lon">144° 43' W</geo>., the variation was found, by several azimuths, to be more than <geo select="lon">3° E</geo>., but the next
morning it was found to be 4° 5' 30", and in the <time>afternoon</time>, <geo select="lon">5° 56' E</geo>. The same day, at <time>noon</time>, we were
in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="1">43° 44' S</geo> , longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">141° 56' W</geo>.</p><p>At <time>nine o'clock  in the morning</time> of the 12th, the longitude was observed as follows, viz.</p><p>  Self 1st set 139° 47' 15"   Ditto, 2d set 140 7 30   Mr Wales 1st set 141 22 15   Mr Wales 2d

140 24 17-1/2 West. </p><p>This differed from my reckoning only 2.5°. The next morning, in the latitude of <geo select="lat">43° 3' S</geo>, 
longitude <geo select="lon">139° 20' W</geo>., we had several lunar observations, which were consonant to those made the day
before, allowing for the ship's run in the time. In the <time>afternoon</time> we had, for a few hours, variable
light airs next to a calm; after which we got a wind from the N.E., blowing fresh and in squalls,
attended with dark gloomy weather, and some rain.</p><p>We stretched to the S.E. till <time>five o'clock</time> in the <time>afternoon</time> on the 14th, at which time, being in
the latitude of <geo select="lat">43° 15' S</geo> , longitude <geo select="lon">137° 39' W</geo>., we tacked and stood to the north under our courses,
having a very hard gale with heavy squalls, attended with rain, till near <time>noon</time> the next day, when it
ended in a calm. At this time we were in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="1">42° 39' S</geo> , longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">137° 58' W</geo>. In the
evening, the calm was succeeded by a breeze from S.W., which soon after increased to a fresh gale;
and fixing at S.S.W, with it we steered N.E. 1/2 E. in the latitude of<geo select="lat" n="2"> 41° 25' S</geo> , longitude <geo select="lon" n="2">135° 58'
W</geo>., we saw floating in the sea a billet of wood, which seemed to be covered with barnacles; so that
there was no judging how long it might have been there, or from whence or how far it had come.</p><p>We continued to steer N.E. 1/2 E., before a very strong gale which blew in squalls, attended with
showers of rain and hail, and a very high sea from the same quarter, till <time>noon</time>, on the 17th. Being
then in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="1">39° 44' S</geo> , longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">133° 32' W</geo>., which was a degree and a half farther east
than I intended to run; nearly in the middle between my track to the north in 1769, and the return
to the south in the same year, and seeing no signs of land, I steered north-easterly, with a view of
exploring that part of the sea lying between the two tracks just mentioned, down as low as the
latitude of<geo select="lat">27° S</geo> , a space that had not been visited by any preceding navigator that I knew of.</p><p>On the 19th, being in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="1">36° 34' S</geo> , longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">133° 7' W</geo>., we steered N. 1/2 W., having
still the advantage of a hard gale at south, which the next day veered to S.E. and E., blew hard and
by squalls, attended with rain and thick hazy weather. This continued till the evening of the 21st,
when the gale abated, the weather cleared up, and the wind backed to the S. and S.E.</p><p>We were now in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="1">32° 30' S</geo> , longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">133° 40' W</geo>., from this situation we steered
N.N.W. till <time>noon</time> the next day, when we steered a point more to the west; being at this time in the
latitude of<geo select="lat" n="2"> 31° 6' S</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon" n="2">134° 12' W</geo>. The weather was now so warm, that it was necessary to put
on lighter clothes; the mercury in the thermometer at <time>noon</time> rose to 63. It had never been lower than
46, and seldom higher than 54, at the same time of the day, since we left New Zealand.</p><p>This day was remarkable by our not seeing a single bird. Not one had passed since we left the
land, without seeing some of the following birds, viz. albatrosses, sheerwaters, pintadoes, blue
peterels, and Port Egmont hens. But these frequent every part of the Southern Ocean in the higher
latitudes: Not a bird, nor any other thing, was seen that could induce us to think that we had ever
been in the neighbourhood of any land.</p><p>The wind kept veering round from the S. by the W. to N.N.W., with which we stretched north till
<time>noon</time> the next day, when, being in the latitude of <geo select="lat">29° 22' S</geo> , we tacked and stretched to the westward.
The wind soon increased to a very hard gale, attended with rain, and blew in such heavy squalls as
to split the most of our sails. This weather continued till the morning of the 25th, when the wind
became more moderate, and veered to N.W. and W.N.W., with which we steered and stretched to N.E.,
being at that time in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="1">29° 51' S</geo> , longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">130° 28' W</geo>. In the <time>afternoon</time> the sky
cleared up, and the weather became fair and settled. We now met the first tropic bird we had seen in
this sea.</p><p>On the 26th, in the <time>afternoon</time>, being in the latitude of <geo select="lat">28° 44' S</geo> , we had several observations of
the sun and moon, which gave the longitude <geo select="lon">135° 30' W</geo>. My reckoning at the same time was 135° 27',
and I had no occasion to correct it since I left the land. We continued to stretch to the north,
with light breezes from the westward, till <time>noon</time>, the next day, when we were stopped by a calm; our
latitude at this time being 27° 53', longitude <geo select="lon">135° 17' W</geo>. In the evening, the calm was succeeded by
a breeze from the N. and N.W., with which we plied to the N.</p><p>On the 29th I sent on board the Adventure to enquire into the state of her crew, having heard
that they were sickly; and this I now found was but too true. Her cook was dead, and about twenty of
her best men were down in the scurvy and flux. At this time <emph rend="italic">we</emph> had only
three men on the sick list, and only one of them attacked with the scurvy. Several more, however,
began to shew symptoms of it, and were accordingly put upon the wort, marmalade of carrots, rob of
lemons and oranges.</p><p>I know not how to account for the scurvy raging more in the one ship than the other, unless it
was owing to the crew of the Adventure being more scorbutic when they arrived in New Zealand than we
were, and to their eating few or no vegetables while they lay in Queen Charlotte's Sound, partly for
want of knowing the right sorts, and partly because it was a new diet, which alone was sufficient
for seamen to reject it. To introduce any new article of food among seamen, let it be ever so much
for their good, requires both the example and authority of a commander; without both, of which it
will be dropt before the people are sensible of the benefits resulting from it. Were it necessary, I
could name fifty instances in support of this remark. Many of my people, officers as well seamen, at
first disliked celery, scurvy-grass, &amp;c., being boiled in the peas and wheat; and some refused
to eat it. But, as this had no effect on my conduct, this obstinate kind of prejudice by little and
little wore off; they began to like it as well as the others; and now, I believe, there was hardly a
man in the ship that did not attribute our being so free from the scurvy, to the beer and vegetables
we made use of at New Zealand. After this I seldom found it necessary to order any of my people to
gather vegetables, whenever we came where any were to be got, and if scarce, happy was he who could
lay hold on them first. I appointed one of my seamen to be cook of the Adventure, and wrote to
Captain Furneaux, desiring him to make use of every method in his power to stop the spreading of the
disease amongst his people, and proposing such as I thought might tend towards it. But I afterwards
found all this unnecessary, as every method had been used they could think of.</p><p><date>1773 August</date></p><p>The wind continued in the N.W. quarter, and blew fresh at times, attended with rain; with which
we stood to the N.E. On the 1st of August, at <time>noon</time>, we were in the latitude of <geo select="lat">25° 1' S</geo>,  longitude
<geo select="lon">134° 6' W</geo>., and had a great hollow swell from N.W. The situation we were now in, was nearly the same
that Captain Carteret assigns for Pitcairn's Island, discovered by him in 1767. We therefore looked
well out for it, but saw nothing. According to the longitude in which he has placed it, we must have
passed about fifteen leagues to the west of it. But as this was uncertain, I did not think it
prudent, considering the situation of the Adventure's people, to lose any time in looking for it. A
sight of it would, however, have been of use in verifying, or correcting, not only the longitude of
this isle, but of the others that Captain Carteret discovered in this neighbourhood; his longitude
not being confirmed, I think, by astronomical observations, and therefore liable to errors, which he
could have no method to correct.</p><p>As we had now got to the northward of Captain Carteret's tracks, all hopes of discovering a
continent vanished. Islands were all we were to expect to find, until we returned again to the
south. I had now, that is on this and my former voyage, crossed this ocean in the latitude of 40° 
and upwards, without meeting any thing that in the least induced me to think I should find what I
was in search after. On the contrary, every thing conspired to make me believe there is no southern
continent, between the meridian of America and New Zealand; at least, this passage did not produce
any indubitable signs of any, as will appear by the following remarks. After leaving the coasts of
New Zealand, we daily saw floating on the sea rock- weed, for the space of 18° of longitude. In my
passage to New Zealand in 1769, we also saw this weed, for the space of 12 or 14° of longitude
before we made the land. The weed is undoubtedly the produce of New Zealand; because the nearer the
coast, the greater quantity you see. At the greatest distance from the coast, we saw it only in
small pieces, generally more rotten, and covered with barnacles, an indubitable sign that it had
been long at sea. Were it not for this, one might be led to conjecture that some other large land
lay in the neighbourhood; for it cannot be a small extent of coast to produce such a quantity of
weed, as to cover so large a space of sea. It hath been already mentioned, that we were no sooner
clear of the straits, than we met with a large hollow swell from the S.E., which continued till we
arrived in the longitude of <geo select="lon" n="1">177° W</geo>., and latitude <geo select="lat" n="1">46° S</geo>. There we had large billows from the N. and
N.E., for five days successively, and until we got 5° of longitude more to the east, although the
wind, great part of the time, blew from different directions. This was a strong indication that
there was no land between us and my track to the west in 1769. After this, we had, as is usual in
all great oceans, large billows from every direction in which the wind blew a fresh gale, but more
especially from the S.W. These billows never ceased with the cause that first put them in motion; a
sure indication that we were not near any large land, and that there is no continent to the south,
unless in a very high latitude. But this was too important a point to be left to opinions and
conjectures. Facts were to determine it, and these could only be obtained by visiting the southern
parts; which was to be the work of the ensuing summer, agreeable to the plan I had laid down. As the
winds continued to blow from the N.W. and W., we had no other choice but to stand to the north,
inclining more or less every day to the east. In the latitude of <geo select="lat">21° S</geo> we saw flying-fish, gannets,
and egg-birds. On the sixth, I hoisted a boat out, and sent for Captain Furneaux to dinner, from
whom I learnt that his people were much better, the flux having left them, and the scurvy was at a
stand. Some cyder which he happened to have, and which he gave to the scorbutic people, contributed
not a little to this happy change. The weather to-day was cloudy, and the wind very unsettled. This
seemed to announce the approach of the so-much-wished-for trade-wind; which, at <time>eight o'clock</time> in the
evening, after two hours calm, and some heavy showers of rain, we actually got at S.E. We were, at
this time, in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="2">19° 36' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="2">131° 32' W</geo>. The not meeting with the S.E.
trade-wind sooner, is no new thing in this sea. As we had now got it, I directed my course to the
W.N.W., as well to keep in the strength of it, as to get to the north of the islands discovered in
my former voyage; that if any other islands lay in the way, I might have a chance to discover them.
During the day-time we made all the sail we could; but, in the night, either run an easy sail, or
lay-to. We daily saw flying-fish, albacores, dolphins, &amp;c., but neither by striking, nor with
hook and line, could we catch any of them. This required some art, which none of my people were
masters of.</p><p>On the 11th at day-break, land was seen to the south. This, upon a nearer approach, we found to
be an island of about two leagues in extent, in the direction of N.W. and S.E., and clothed with
wood, above which the cocoa- nut trees shewed their lofty heads. I judged it to be one of those
isles discovered by Mr Bougainville. It lies in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="1">17° 24' S</geo> , longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">141° 39' W</geo>., and
I called it after the name of the ship, Resolution Island. The sickly state of the Adventure's crew
made it necessary for me to make the best of my way to Otaheite, where I was sure of finding
refreshments. Consequently I did not wait to examine this island, which appeared too small to supply
our wants, but continued our course to the west, and at <time>six o'clock  in the evening</time>, land was seen
from the mast-head, bearing W. by S. Probably this was another of Bougainville's discoveries. I
named it Doubtful Island, and it lies in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="2">17° 20' S</geo> , longitude <geo select="lon" n="2">141° 38' W</geo>. I was sorry
I could not spare time to haul to the north of Mr Bougainville's track; but the getting to a place
where we could procure refreshments, was more an object at this time than discovery.</p><p>During the night we steered W. by N., in order to pass the north of the island above-mentioned.
At day-break the next morning, we discovered land right a-head, distant about two miles; so that
day-light advised us of our danger but just in time. This proved another of these low or
half-drowned islands, or rather a large coral shoal of about twenty leagues in circuit. A very small
part of it was land, which consisted of little islets ranged along the north side, and connected by
sand-banks and breakers. These islets were clothed with wood, among which the cocoa-nut trees were
only distinguishable. We ranged the south side of this isle or shoal at the distance of one or two
miles from the coral-bank, against which the sea broke in a dreadful surf. In the middle is a large
lake or inland sea, in which was a canoe under sail.</p><p>This island, which I named after Captain Furneaux, lies in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="1">17° 5' S</geo>,  longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">143°
16' W</geo>. The situation is nearly the same that is assigned for one of those discovered by
Bougainville. I must here observe, that amongst these low and half-drowned isles (which are numerous
in this part of the ocean,) Mr Bougainville's discoveries cannot be known to that degree of accuracy
which is necessary to distinguish them from others. We were obliged to have recourse to his chart
for the latitudes and longitudes of the isles he discovered, as neither the one nor the other is
mentioned in his narrative. Without waiting to examine this island we continued to steer to the
west, all sails set, till <time>six o'clock  in the evening</time>, when we shortened sail to three top-sails, and
at nine brought-to.</p><p>The next morning at four a.m. we made sail, and at daybreak saw another of these low islands,
situated in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="1">17° 4' S</geo>,  longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">144° 30' W</geo>., which obtained the name of Adventure
Island. M. de Bougainville very properly calls this cluster of low overflowed isles the Dangerous
Archipelago. The smoothness of the sea sufficiently convinced us that we were surrounded by them,
and how necessary it was to proceed with the utmost caution, especially in the night.</p><p>At <time>five o'clock</time> p.m. we again saw land, bearing S.W. by S., which we afterwards found to be Chain
Island, discovered in my former voyage. But as I was not sure of it at this time, and being desirous
of avoiding the delay which lying by in the night occasioned, I hoisted out the cutter, and manned
her with an officer and seven men, with orders to keep as far a-head of the ships, with a light at
her masthead, as a signal could be distinguished, which she was to make in case she met with any
danger. In this manner we continued to run all night; and, at <time>six o'clock</time> the next morning, I called
her on board, and hoisted her in. For it did not appear she would be wanted again for this purpose,
as we had now a large swell from the south, a sure sign that we were clear of the low islands;
therefore I steered for Otaheite without being apprehensive of meeting with any danger.</p></div><div type="chapter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N"><head><l part="N">CHAPTER X.</l><l part="N"><emph rend="italic">Arrival of the Ships at Otaheite, with an Account of the critical Situation they
were in, and of several Incidents that happened while they lay in Oaiti-piha Bay.</emph></l></head><p><date>1773 August</date></p><p>On the 15th, at <time>five o'clock  in the morning</time>, we saw Osnaburg Island, or Maitea, discovered by
Captain Wallis, bearing S. by W. 1/2 W. Soon after I brought-to, and waited for the Adventure to
come up with us, to acquaint Captain Furneaux that it was my intention to put into Oaiti-piha Bay,
near the south-east end of Otaheite, in order to get what refreshments we could from that part of
the island, before we went down to Matavia. This done, we made sail, and at six in the evening saw
the land bearing west. We continued to stand on till midnight, when we brought-to, till <time>four o'clock</time>
in the morning, and then made sail in for the land with a fine breeze at east.</p><p>At day-break we found ourselves not more than half a league from the reef. The breeze now began
to fail us, and at last fell to a calm. This made it necessary to hoist out our boats to tow the
ships off; but all their efforts were not sufficient to keep them from being carried near the reef.
A number of the inhabitants came off in canoes from different parts, bringing with them a little
fish, a few cocoa-nuts, and other fruits, which they exchanged for nails, beads, &amp;c. The most of
them knew me again, and many enquired for Mr Banks and others who were with me before; but not one
asked for Tupia. As the calm continued, our situation became still more dangerous. We were, however,
not without hopes of getting round the western point of the reef and into the bay, till about two
o'clock in the <time>afternoon</time>, when we came before an opening or break in the reef, through which I hoped
to get with the ships. But on sending to examine it, I found there was not a sufficient depth of
water; though it caused such an in- draught of the tide of flood through it, as was very near
proving fatal to the Resolution; for as soon as the ships got into the stream, they were carried
with great impetuosity towards the reef. The moment I perceived this, I ordered one of the warping
machines, which we had in readiness, to be carried out with about four hundred fathoms of rope; but
it had not the least effect. The horrors of shipwreck now stared us in the face. We were not more
than two cables length from the breakers; and yet we could find no bottom to anchor, the only
probable means we had left to save the ships. We, however, dropt an anchor; but, before it took
hold, and brought us up, the ship was in less than three fathom water, and struck at every fall of
the sea, which broke close under our stem in a dreadful surf, and threatened us every moment with
shipwreck. The Adventure, very luckily, brought up close upon our bow without striking.</p><p>We presently carried out two kedge-anchors, with hawsers to each; these found ground a little
without the bower, but in what depth we never knew. By heaving upon them, and cutting away the
bower-anchor, we got the ship a- float, where we lay some time in the greatest anxiety, expecting
every minute that either the kedges would come home, or the hawsers be cut in two by the rocks. At
length the tide ceased to act in the same direction. I ordered all the boats to try to tow off the
Resolution; and when I saw this was practicable, we hove up the two kedges. At that moment, a light
air came off from the land, which so much assisted the boats, that we soon got clear of all danger.
Then I ordered all the boats to assist the Adventure, but before they reached her, she was under
sail with the land-breeze, and soon after joined us, leaving behind her three anchors, her coasting
cable, and two hawsers, which were never recovered. Thus we were once more safe at sea, after
narrowly escaping being wrecked on the very island we but a few days before so ardently wished to be
at. The calm, after bringing us into this dangerous situation, very fortunately continued; for, had
the sea- breeze, as is usual, set in, the Resolution must inevitably have been lost, and probably
the Adventure too.</p><p>During the lime we were in this critical situation, a number of the natives were on board and
about the ships. They seemed to be insensible of our danger, shewing not the least surprise, joy, or
fear, when we were striking, and left us a little before sun-set, quite unconcerned.</p><p>We spent the night, which proved squally and rainy, making short boards; and the next morning,
being the 17th, we anchored in Oaiti-piha Bay in twelve fathoms water about two cables length from
the shore; both ships being by this time crowded with a great number of the natives, who brought
with them cocoa-nuts, plantains, bananoes, apples, yams, and other roots, which they exchanged for
nails and beads. To several, who called themselves chiefs, I made presents of shirts, axes, and
several other articles, and, in return, they promised to bring me hogs and fowls, a promise they
never did, nor ever intended to perform.</p><p>In the <time>afternoon</time>, I landed in company with Captain Furneaux, in order to view the watering-place,
and to sound the disposition of the natives, I also sent a boat to get some water for present use,
having scarcely any left on board. We found this article as convenient as could be expected, and the
natives to behave with great civility.</p><p>Early in the morning, I sent the two launches and the Resolution's cutter, under the command of
Mr Gilbert, to endeavour to recover the anchors we had left behind us; they returned about <time>noon</time>,
with the Resolution's bower anchor, but could not recover any of the Adventure's. The natives came
off again with fruit, as the day before, but in no great quantity. I also had a party on shore,
trading under the protection of a guard; nothing, however, was brought to market but fruit and
roots, though many hogs were seen (I was told) about the houses of the natives. The cry was, that
they belonged to Waheatoun the <emph rend="italic">Earee de hi</emph>, or king, and him we had not
yet seen, nor, I believe, any other chief of note. Many, however, who called themselves <emph rend="italic">Earees</emph>, came on board, partly with a view of getting presents, and partly to
pilfer whatever came in their way.</p><p>One of this sort of <emph rend="italic">Earees</emph> I had, most of the day, in the cabin, and
made presents to him and all his friends, which were not few; at length he was caught taking things
which did not belong to him, and handing them out of the quarter gallery. Many complaints of the
like nature were made to me against those on deck, which occasioned my turning them all out of the
ship. My cabin guest made good haste to be gone; I was so much exasperated at his behaviour, that
after he had got some distance from the ship, I fired two muskets over his head, which made him quit
the canoe, and take to the water; I then sent a boat to take up the canoe, but as she came near the
shore, the people from thence began to pelt her with stones. Being in some pain for her safety, as
she was unarmed, I went myself in another boat to protect her, and ordered a great gun, loaded with
ball, to be fired along the coast, which made them all retire from the shore, and I was suffered to
bring away two canoes without the least shew of opposition. In one of the canoes was a little boy,
who was much frightened, but I soon dissipated his fears, by giving him beads, and putting him on
shore. A few hours after, we were all good friends again, and the canoes were returned to the first
person who came for them.</p><p>It was not till the evening of this day, that any one enquired after Tupia, and then but two or
three. As soon as they learnt the cause of his death, they were quite satisfied; indeed, it did not
appear to me, that it would have caused a moment's uneasiness in the breast of any one, had his
death been occasioned by any other means than by sickness. As little enquiry was made after
Aotourou, the man who went away with M. de Bougainville. But they were continually asking for Mr
Banks, and several others who were with me in my former voyage.</p><p>These people informed us, that Toutaha, the regent of the greater peninsula of Otaheite, had been
killed in a battle, which was fought between the two kingdoms about five months before, and that
<emph rend="italic">Otoo</emph> was the reigning prince. Tubourai Tamaide, and several more of our
principal friends about Matavai, fell in this battle, as also a great number of common people; but,
at present, a peace subsisted between the two kingdoms.</p><p>On the 19th, we had gentle breezes easterly, with some smart showers of rain. Early in the
morning, the boats were again sent to recover the Adventure's anchors, but returned with the same
ill success as the day before, so that we ceased to look for them any longer, thinking ourselves
very happy in having come off so well, considering the situation we had been in. In an excursion
which Captain Furneaux and I made along the coast, we met with a chief who entertained us with
excellent fish, fruit, &amp;c. In return for his hospitality, I made him a present of an axe and
other things; and he afterwards accompanied us back to the ships, where he made but a short
stay.</p><p>Nothing worthy of note happened on the 20th, till the dusk of the evening, when one of the
natives made off with a musquet belonging to the guard on shore. I was present when this happened,
and sent some of our people after him, which would have been to little purpose, had not some of the
natives, of their own accord, pursued the thief. They knocked him down, took from him the musquet,
and brought it to us. Fear, on this occasion, certainly operated more with them than principle. They
deserve, however, to be applauded for this act of justice, for, if they had not given their
immediate assistance, it would hardly have been in my power to have recovered the musquet, by any
gentle means whatever, and by making use of any other, I was sure to lose more than ten times its
value.</p><p>The 21st, the wind was at north, a fresh breeze. This morning a chief made me a visit, and
presented me with a quantity of fruit, among which, were a number of cocoanuts we had drawn the
water from, and afterwards thrown, over board; these he had picked up, and tied in bundles so
artfully, that we did not at first perceive the cheat; when he was told of it, without betraying the
least emotion, and, as if he knew nothing of the matter, he opened two or three of them himself,
signified to us, that he was satisfied it was so, and then went ashore and sent off a quantity of
plantains and bananoes. Having got on board a supply of water, fruit, and roots, I determined to
sail in the morning to Matavai, as I found it was not likely that I should get an interview with
Waheatoua, without which, it was very improbable we should get any hogs. Two of the natives, who
knew my intention, slept on board, with a view of going with us to Matavai, but, in the morning, the
wind blew fresh at N.W., and as we could not sail, I sent the trading party on shore as usual.</p><p>In the evening, I was informed that Waheatoua was come into the neighourhood, and wanted to see
me. In consequence of this information, I determined to wait one day longer, in order to have an
interview with this prince. Accordingly, early the next morning, I set out in company with Captain
Furneaux, Mr Forster, and several of the natives. We met the chief about a mile from the
landing-place, towards which he was advancing to meet us; but, as soon as he saw us, he stopt, with
his numerous train, in the open air. I found him seated upon a stool, with a circle of people round
him, and knew him at first sight, and he me, having seen each other several times in 1769. At that
time he was but a boy, and went by the name of Tearee, but, upon the death of his father, Waheatoun,
he took upon him that name.</p><p>After the first salutation was over, having seated me on the same stool with himself, and the
other gentlemen on the ground by us, he began to enquire after several by name who were with me on
my former voyage. He next enquired how long I would stay, and when I told him no longer than next
day, he seemed sorry, asked me to stay some months, and at last came down to five days, promising,
that in that time I should have hogs in plenty; but, as I had been here already a week, without so
much as getting one, I could not put any faith in this promise; and yet, I believe, if I had staid,
we should have fared much better than at Matavai. The present I made him consisted of a shirt, a
sheet, a broad axe, spike-nails, knives, looking-glasses, medals, beads, &amp;c.; in return, he
ordered a pretty good hog to be carried to our boat. We staid with him all the morning, during which
time, he never suffered me to go from his side, where he was seated. I was also seated on the same
stool, which was carried from place to place by one of his attendants, whom he called stool-bearer.
At length we took leave, in order to return on board to dinner, after which, we visited him again,
and made him more presents, and he, in return, gave Captain Furneaux and me each of us an hog. Some
others were got by exchanges at the trading places; so that we got in the whole, to-day, as much
fresh pork as gave the crews of both the ships a meal; and this in consequence of our having this
interview with the chief.</p><p>The 24th, early in the morning, we put to sea with a light land-breeze. Soon after we were out,
we got the wind at west, which blew in squalls, attended with heavy showers of rain. Many canoes
accompanied us out to sea, with cocoa-nuts and other fruits, and did not leave us till they had
disposed of their cargoes.</p><p>The fruits we got here greatly contributed towards the recovery of the Adventure's sick people;
many of them, who had been so ill as not to be able to move without assistance, were, in this short
time so far recovered, that they could walk about of themselves. When we put in here, the Resolution
had but one scorbutic man on board, and a marine, who had been long sick, and who died the second
day after our arrival, of a complication of disorders, without the least mixture of the scurvy. I
left Lieutenant Pickersgill, with the cutter, behind the bay, to purchase hogs, as several had
promised to bring some down to-day, and I was not willing to lose them.</p><p>On the 25th; about <time>noon</time>, Mr Pickersgill returned with eight hogs, which he got at Oaiti-piha. He
spent the night at Ohedea, and was well entertained by Ereti, the chief of that district. It was
remarkable, that this chief never once asked after Aotouroo, nor did he take the least notice when
Mr Pickersgill mentioned his name. And yet M. de Bougainville tells us, this is the very chief who
presented Aotourou to him; which makes it the more extraordinary, that he should neither enquire
after him now, nor when he was with us at Matavai, especially as they believed that we and M. de
Bougainville came from the same country, that is, from <emph rend="italic">Pretane</emph>, for so
they called our country. They had not the least knowledge of any other European nation, nor probably
will they, unless some of those men should return who had lately gone from the isle, of which
mention shall be made bye and bye. We told several of them, that M. de Bougainville came from
France, a name they could by no means pronounce; nor could they pronounce that of Paris much better;
so that it is not likely that they will remember either the one or the other long; whereas <emph rend="italic">Pretane</emph> is in every child's mouth, and will hardly ever be forgotten. It was
not till the evening of this day that we arrived in Matavai bay.</p></div><div type="chapter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N"><head><l>CHAPTER XI.</l><l><emph rend="italic">An Account of several Visits to and from Otoo; of Goats being left on the
Island; and many other Particulars which happened while the Ships lay in Matavai Bay.</emph></l></head><p><date>1773 August</date></p><p>Before we got to an anchor, our decks were crowded with the natives; many of whom I knew, and
almost all of them knew me. A great crowd were gotten together upon the shore; amongst whom was Otoo
their king. I was just going to pay him a visit, when I was told he was <emph rend="italic">mataow'd</emph>, and gone to Oparree. I could not conceive the reason of his going off in a fright,
as every one seemed pleased to see me. A chief, whose name was Maritata, was at this time on board,
and advised me to put off my visit till the next morning, when he would accompany me; which I
accordingly did.</p><p>After having given directions to pitch tents for the reception of the sick, coopers, sail-makers,
and the guard, I set out on the 26th for Oparree; accompanied by Captain Furneaux, Mr Forster, and
others, Maritata and his wife. As soon as we landed, we were conducted to Otoo, whom we found seated
on the ground, under the shade of a tree, with an immense crowd around him. After the first
compliments were over, I presented him with such articles as I guessed were most valuable in his
eyes; well knowing that it was my interest to gain the friendship of this man. I also made presents
to several of his attendants; and, in return, they offered me cloth, which I refused to accept;
telling them that what I had given was for <emph rend="italic">tiyo</emph> (friendship). The king
enquired for Tupia, and all the gentlemen that were with me in my former voyage, by name; although I
do not remember that he was personally acquainted with any of us. He promised that I should have
some hogs the next day; but I had much ado to obtain a promise from him to visit me on board. He
said he was, <emph rend="italic">mataou no to poupoue</emph>, that is, afraid of the guns. Indeed
all his actions shewed him to be a timorous prince. He was about thirty years of age, six feet high,
and a fine, personable, well-made man as one can see. All his subjects appeared uncovered before
him, his father not excepted. What is meant by uncovering, is the making bare the head and
shoulders, or wearing no sort of clothing above the breast.</p><p>When I returned from Oparree, I found the tents, and the astronomer's observatories, set up on
the same spot where we observed the transit of Venus in 1769. In the <time>afternoon</time>, I had the sick
landed; twenty from the Adventure, all ill of the scurvy; and one from the Resolution. I also landed
some marines for a guard, and left the command to Lieutenant Edgecumbe of the marines.</p><p>On the 27th, early in the morning, Otoo, attended by a numerous train, paid me a visit. He first
sent into the ship a large quantity of cloth, fruits, a hog, and two large fish; and, after some
persuasion, came aboard himself, with his sister, a younger brother, and several more of his
attendants. To all of them I made presents; and, after breakfast, took the king, his sister, and as
many more as I had room for, into my boat, and carried them home to Oparree. I had no sooner landed
than I was met by a venerable old lady, the mother of the late Toutaha. She seized me by both hands,
and burst into a flood of tears, saying, <emph rend="italic">Toutaha Tiyo no Toutee matty
Toutaha</emph>—(Toutaha, your friend, or the friend of Cook, is dead.) I was so much affected with
her behaviour, that it would have been impossible for me to have refrained mingling my tears with
hers, had not Otoo come and taken me from her. I, with some difficulty, prevailed on him to let me
see her again, when I gave her an axe and some other things. Captain Furneaux, who was with me,
presented the king with two fine goats, male and female, which if taken care of, or rather if no
care at all is taken of them will no doubt multiply. After a short stay, we look leave and returned
on board.</p><p>Very early in the morning on the 28th, I sent Mr Pickersgill, with the cutter, as far as
Ottahourou, to procure hogs. A little after sun-rise, I had another visit from Otoo, who brought me
more cloth, a pig, and some fruit. His sister, who was with him, and some of his attendants, came on
board; but he and others went to the Adventure with the like present to Captain Furneaux. It was not
long before he returned with Captain Furneaux on board the Resolution, when I made him a handsome
return for the present he had brought me, and dressed his sister out in the best manner I could.
She, the king's brother, and one or two more, were covered before him to- day. When Otoo came into
the cabin, Ereti and some of his friends were sitting there. The moment they saw the king enter,
they stripped themselves in great haste, being covered before. Seeing I took notice of it, they said
<emph rend="italic">Earee, Earee</emph>; giving me to understand that it was on account of Otoo
being present. This was all the respect they paid him; for they never rose from their seats, nor
made him any other obeisance. When the king thought proper to depart, I carried him again to Oparree
in my boat; where I entertained him and his people with the bagpipes (of which music they are very
fond) and dancing by the seamen. He then ordered some of his people to dance also, which consisted
chiefly of contortions. There were some, however, who could imitate the seamen pretty well, both in
country-dances and hornpipes. While we were here, I had a present of cloth from the late Toutaha's
mother. This good old lady could not look upon me without shedding tears; however, she was far more
composed than before. When we took leave, the king promised to visit me again the next day; but said
that I must first come to him. In the evening Mr Pickersgill came back empty, but with a promise of
having some hogs, if he would return in a few days.</p><p>Next morning after breakfast, I took a trip to Oparree, to visit Otoo as he had requested,
accompanied by Captain Furneaux and some of the officers. We made him up a present of such things as
he had not seen before. One article was a broad-sword; at the sight of which he was so intimidated,
that I had much ado to persuade him to accept of it, and to have it buckled upon him; where it
remained but a short time, before he desired leave to take it off, and send it out of his sight.</p><p>Soon after we were conducted to the theatre; where we were entertained with a dramatic <emph rend="italic">heuva</emph>, or <emph rend="italic">play</emph>, in which were both dancing and
comedy. The performers were five men, and one woman, who was no less a person than the king's
sister. The music consisted of three drums only; it lasted about an hour and a half, or two hours;
and, upon the whole, was well conducted. It was not possible for us to find out the meaning of the
play. Some part seemed adapted to the present time, as my name was frequently mentioned. Other parts
were certainly wholly unconnected with us. It apparently differed in nothing, that is, in the manner
of acting it, from those we saw at Ulielea in my former voyage. The dancing-dress of the lady was
more elegant than any I saw there, by being decorated with long tassels, made of feathers, hanging
from the waist downward. As soon as all was over, the king himself desired me to depart; and sent
into the boat different kinds of fruit and fish, ready dressed. With this we returned on board; and
the next morning he sent me more fruit, and several small parcels of fish.</p><p>Nothing farther remarkable happened till <time>ten o'clock  in the evening</time>, when we were alarmed with
the cry of murder, and a great noise, on shore, near the bottom of the bay, at some distance from
our encampment. I suspected that it was occasioned by some of our own people; and immediately armed
a boat, and sent on shore, to know the occasion of this disturbance, and to bring off such of our
people as should be found there. I also sent to the Adventure, and to the post on shore, to know who
were missing; for none were absent from the Resolution but those who were upon duty. The boat soon
returned with three marines and a seaman. Some others belonging to the Adventure were also taken;
and, being all put under confinement, the next morning I ordered them to be punished according to
their deserts. I did not find that any mischief was done, and our people would confess nothing. I
believe this disturbance was occasioned by their making too free with the women. Be this as it will,
the natives were so much alarmed, that they fled from their habitations in the dead of the night,
and the alarm spread many miles along the coast. For when I went to visit Otoo, in the morning, by
appointment, I found him removed, or rather fled, many miles from the place of his abode. Even there
I was obliged to wait some hours, before I could see him at all; and when I did, he complained of
the last night's riot.</p><p>As this was intended to be my last visit, I had taken with me a present suitable to the occasion.
Among other things were three Cape sheep, which he had seen before and asked for; for these people
never lose a thing by not asking for it. He was much pleased with them; though he could be but
little benefited, as they were all weathers; a thing he was made acquainted with. The presents he
got at this interview entirely removed his fears, and opened his heart so much, that he sent for
three hogs; one for me, one for Captain Furneaux, and one for Mr Forster. This last was small, of
which we complained, calling it <emph rend="italic">ete, ete</emph>. Presently after a man came into
the circle, and spoke to the king with some warmth, and in a very peremptory manner; saying
something or other about hogs. We at first thought he was angry with the king for giving us so many,
especially as he took the little pig away with him. The contrary, however, appeared to be the true
cause of his displeasure; for, presently after he was gone, a hog, larger than either of the other
two, was brought us in lieu of the little one. When we took leave, I acquainted him that I should
sail from the island the next day; at which he seemed much moved, and embraced me several times. We
embarked to return on board, and he, with his numerous train, directed his march back to
Oparree.</p><p><date>1773 September</date></p><p>The sick being all pretty well recovered, our water-casks repaired, and water completed, as well
as the necessary repairs of the ships, I determined to put to sea without farther delay.
Accordingly, on the 1st of September, I ordered every thing to be got off from the shore, and the
ships to be unmoored. On this work we were employed the most of the day. In the <time>afternoon</time>, Mr
Pickersgill returned from Attahourou; to which place I had sent him, two days before, for the hogs
he had been promised. My old friend Pottatou, the chief of that district, his wife, or mistress, (I
know not which,) and some more of his friends, came along with Mr Pickersgill, in order to visit me.
They brought me a present of two hogs and some fish; and Mr Pickersgill got two more hogs, by
exchange, from Oamo; for he went in the boat as far as Paparra, where he saw old Oberea. She seemed
much altered for the worse, poor, and of little consequence. The first words she said to Mr
Pickersgill were, <emph rend="italic">Earee mataou ina boa</emph>, Earee is frightened, you can have
no hogs. By this it appeared that she had little or no property, and was herself subject to the
Earee, which I believe was not the case when I was here before. The wind, which had blown westerly
all day, having shifted at once to the east, we put to sea; and I was obliged to dismiss my friends
sooner than they wished to go; but well satisfied with the reception they had met with.</p><p>Some hours before we got under sail, a young man, whose name was Poreo, came and desired I would
take him with me. I consented, thinking he might be of service to us on some occasion. Many more
offered themselves, but I refused to take them. This youth asked me for an axe and a spike-nail for
his father, who was then on board. He had them accordingly, and they parted just as we were getting
under sail, more like two strangers than father and son. This raised a doubt in me whether it was
so; which was farther confirmed, by a canoe, conducted by two men, coming along-side, as we were
standing out of the bay, and demanding the young man in the name of Otoo. I now saw that the whole
was a trick to get something from me; well knowing that Otoo was not in the neighbourhood, and could
know nothing of the matter. Poreo seemed, however, at first undetermined whether he should go or
stay; but he soon inclined to the former. I told them to return me the axe and nails, and then he
should go, (and so he really should,) but they said they were on shore, and so departed. Though the
youth seemed pretty well satisfied, he could not refrain from weeping when he viewed the land
astern.</p></div><div type="chapter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N"><head><l>CHAPTER XII.</l><l><emph rend="italic">An Account of the Reception we met with at Huaheine, with the Incidents that
happened while the Ships lay there; and of Omai, one of the Natives, coming away in the
Adventure.</emph></l></head><p><date>1773 September</date></p><p>As soon as we were clear of the bay, and our boats in, I directed my course for the island of
Huaheine, where I intended to touch. We made it the next day, and spent the night, making short
boards under the north end of the island. At day-light, in the morning of the 3d, we made sail for
the harbour of Owharre; in which the Resolution anchored, about <time>nine o'clock</time>, in twenty-four fathoms
water. As the wind blew out of the harbour, I chose to turn in by the southern channel, it being the
widest. The Resolution turned in very well, but the Adventure, missing stays, got ashore on the
north side of the channel. I had the Resolution's launch in the water ready, in case of an accident
of this kind, and sent her immediately to the Adventure. By this timely assistance, she was got off
again, without receiving any damage. Several of the natives, by this time, had come off to us,
bringing with them some of the productions of the island; and as soon as the ships were both in
safety, I landed with Captain Furneaux, and was received by the natives with the utmost cordiality.
I distributed some presents among them; and they presently after brought down hogs, fowls, dogs, and
fruits, which they willingly exchanged for hatchets, nails, beads, &amp;c. The like trade was soon
opened on board the ships; so that we had a fair prospect of being plentifully supplied with fresh
pork and fowls; and to people in our situation, this was no unwelcome thing. I learnt that my old
friend Oree, chief of the isle, was still living, and that he was hastening to this part to see
me.</p><p>Early next morning, Lieutenant Pickersgill sailed with the cutter, on a trading party, toward the
south end of the isle. I also sent another trading party on shore near the ships, with which I went
myself, to see that it was properly conducted at the first setting out, a very necessary point to be
attended to. Every thing being settled to my mind, I went, accompanied by Captain Furneaux and Mr
Forster, to pay my first visit to Oree, who, I was told, was waiting for me. We were conducted to
the place by one of the natives; but were not permitted to go out of our boat, till we had gone
through some part of the following ceremony usually performed at this isle, on such like occasions.
The boat in which we were desired to remain being landed before the chief's house, which stood close
to the shore, five young plaintain trees, which are their emblems of peace, were brought on board
separately, and with some ceremony. Three young pigs, with their ears ornamented with cocoa-nut
fibres, accompanied the first three; and a dog, the fourth. Each had its particular name and
purpose, rather too mysterious for us to understand. Lastly, the chief sent to me the inscription
engraved on a small piece of pewter, which I left with him in <date>July 1769</date>. It was in the same bag I
had made for it, together with a piece of counterfeit English coin, and a few beads, put in at the
same time; which shews how well he had taken care of the whole. When they had made an end of putting
into the boat the things just mentioned, our guide, who still remained with us, desired us to
decorate the young plaintain trees with looking-glasses, nails, medals, beads, &amp;c. &amp;c. This
being accordingly done, we landed with these in our hands, and were conducted towards the chief,
through the multitude; they making a lane, as it were, for us to pass through. We were made to sit
down a few paces short of the chief, and our plantains were then taken from us, and, one by one,
laid before him, as the others had been laid before us. One was for <emph rend="italic">Eatoua</emph> (or God), the second for the <emph rend="italic">Earee</emph> (or king), and the
third for <emph rend="italic">Tiyo</emph> (or friendship). This being done, I wanted to go to the
king, but was told that he would come to me; which he accordingly did, fell upon my neck, and
embraced me. This was by no means ceremonious; the tears which trickled plentifully down his
venerable old cheeks, sufficiently bespoke the language of his heart. The whole ceremony being over,
all his friends were introduced to us, to whom we made presents. Mine to the chief consisted of the
most valuable articles I had; for I regarded this man as a father. In return he gave me a hog, and a
quantity of cloth, promising that all our wants should be supplied; and it will soon appear how well
he kept his word. At length we took leave, and returned on board; and, some time after, Mr
Pickersgill returned also with fourteen hogs. Many more were got by exchanges on shore, and
along-side the ships; besides fowls and fruit in abundance.</p><p>This good old chief made me a visit early in the morning on the 5th, together with some of his
friends, bringing me a hog and some fruit, for which I made him a suitable return. He carried his
kindness so far, as not to fail to send me every day, for my table, the very best of ready dressed
fruit and roots, and in great plenty. Lieutenant Pickersgill being again sent with the two boats, in
search of hogs, returned in the evening with twenty-eight; and about four times that number were
purchased on shore, and along-side the ships.</p><p>Next morning the trading party, consisting of only two or three people, were sent on shore as
usual; and, after breakfast, I went to the place myself, when I learnt that one of the inhabitants
had been very troublesome and insolent. This man being pointed out to me, completely equipped in the
war habit, with a club in each hand, as he seemed bent on mischief, I took these from him, broke
them before his eyes, and, with some difficulty, forced him to retire from the place. As they told
me that he was a chief, this made me the more suspicious of him, and occasioned me to send for a
guard, which till now I had thought unnecessary. About this time, Mr Sparrman, having imprudently
gone out alone botanizing, was set upon by two men, who stripped him of every thing he had about
him, except his trowsers, and struck him several times with his own hanger, but happily did him no
harm. As soon as they had accomplished their end, they made off; after which another of the natives
brought a piece of cloth to cover him, and conducted him to the trading place, where were a great
number of the inhabitants. The very instant Mr Sparrman appeared in the condition I have just
mentioned, they all fled with the utmost precipitation. I at first conjectured they had stolen
something; but we were soon undeceived upon Mr Sparrman's relating the affair to us. As soon as I
could recal a few of the natives, and had made them sensible that I should take no step to injure
those who were innocent, I went to Oree to complain of this outrage, taking with us the man who came
back with Mr Sparrman, to confirm the complaint. As soon as the chief heard the whole affair
related, he wept aloud, as did many others. After the first transports of his grief were over, he
began to expostulate with his people, telling them (as far as we could understand) how well I had
treated them, both in this and my former voyage, and how base it was in them to commit such actions.
He then took a very minute account of the things Mr Sparrman had been robbed of, promised to do all
in his power to recover them, and, rising up, desired me to follow him to my boat. When the people
saw this, being, as I supposed, apprehensive of his safety, they used every argument to dissuade him
from what they, no doubt, thought a rash step. He hastened into the boat, notwithstanding all they
could do or say. As soon as they saw their beloved chief wholly in my power, they set up a great
outcry. The grief they shewed was inexpressible; every face was bedewed with tears; they prayed,
entreated, nay, attempted to pull him out of the boat. I even joined my entreaties to theirs; for I
could not bear to see them in such distress. All that could be said, or done, availed nothing. He
insisted on my coming into the boat, which was no sooner done than he ordered it to be put off. His
sister, with a spirit equal to that of her royal brother, was the only person who did not oppose his
going. As his intention in coming into our boat was to go with us in search of the robbers, we
proceeded accordingly as far as was convenient by water, then landed, entered the country, and
travelled some miles inland, the chief leading the way, enquiring of every one he saw. At length he
stepped into a house by the road side, ordered some cocoa-nuts for us, and after we were a little
refreshed, wanted to proceed still farther. But this I opposed, thinking that we might be carried to
the very farthest end of the island, after things, the most of which, before they came into our
hands again, might not be worth the bringing home. The chief used many arguments to persuade me to
proceed, telling me that I might send my boat round to meet us, or that he would get a canoe to
bring us home, if I thought it too far to travel. But I was resolved to return, and he was obliged
to comply and return with me, when he saw I would follow him no farther. I only desired he would
send somebody for the things; for I found that the thieves had got so much start of us, that we
might follow them to the remotest parts of the isle, without so much as seeing them. Besides, as I
intended to sail the next morning, this occasioned a great loss to us, by putting a stop to all
manner of trade; for the natives were so much alarmed, that none came near us, but those that were
about the chief. It therefore became the more necessary for me to return, to restore things to their
former state. When we got back to our boat, we there found Oree's sister, and several more persons,
who had travelled by land to the place. We immediately stepped into the boat in order to return on
board, without so much as asking the chief to accompany us. He, however, insisted on going also, and
followed us into the boat in spite of the opposition and entreaties of those about him; his sister
followed his example, and the tears and prayers of her daughter, who was about sixteen or eighteen
years of age, had no weight with her on this occasion. The chief sat at table with us, and made a
hearty dinner; his sister, according to custom, eat nothing. After dinner, I sufficiently rewarded
them for the confidence they had put in me; and, soon after, carried them both on shore, where some
hundreds of people waited to receive them, many of whom embraced their chief with tears of joy. All
was now joy and peace: The people crowded in, from every part, with hogs, fowls, and fruit, so that
we presently filled two boats: Oree himself presented me with a large hog and a quantity of fruit.
The hanger (the only thing of value Mr Sparrman had lost) with part of his coat, were brought us;
and we were told, we should have the others the next day. Some of the officers, who were out on a
shooting party, had some things stolen from them, which were returned in like manner.</p><p>Thus ended the troublesome transactions of this day, which I have been the more particular in
relating, because it shews what great confidence this brave old chief put in us; it also in some
degree shews, that friendship is sacred with them. Oree and I were professed friends in all the
forms customary among them; and he seemed to think that this could not be broken by the act of any
other persons. Indeed this seemed to be the great argument he made use of to his people, when they
opposed his going into my boat. His words were to this effect:—"Oree (meaning me, for so I was
always called) and I are friends; I have done nothing to forfeit his friendship; why then should I
not go with him?" We, however, may never find another chief who will act in the same manner, under
similar circumstances. It may be asked, What had he to fear? to which I answer, Nothing. For it was
not my intention to hurt a hair of his head, or to detain him a moment longer than he desired. But
how was he or the people to know this? They were not ignorant, that if he was once in my power, the
whole force of the island could not take him from me, and that, let my demands for his ransom have
been ever so high, they must have complied with them. Thus far their fears, both for his and their
own safety, were founded in reason.</p><p>On the 7th, early in the morning, while the ships were unmooring, I went to pay my farewell visit
to Oree, accompanied by Captain Furneaux and Mr Forster. We took with us for a present, such things
as were not only valuable, but useful. I also left with him the inscription plate he had before in
keeping, and another small copper-plate, on which were engraved these words: "Anchored here, his
"Britannic Majesty's ships Resolution and Adventure, <date>September, 1773</date>," together with some medals,
all put up in a bag; of which the chief promised to take care, and to produce to the first ship or
ships that should arrive at the island. He then gave me a hog; and, after trading for six or eight
more, and loading the boat with fruit, we took leave, when the good old chief embraced me with tears
in his eyes. At this interview nothing was said about the remainder of Mr Sparrman's clothes. I
judged they were not brought in; and for that reason did not mention them, lest I should give the
chief pain about things I did not give him time to recover; for this was early in the morning.</p><p>When we returned to the ships, we found them crowded round with canoes full of hogs, fowls, and
fruit, as at our first arrival. I had not been long on board, before Oree himself came to inform me,
as we understood, that the robbers were taken, and to desire us to go on shore, either to punish, or
to see them punished; but this could not be done, as the Resolution was just under sail, and the
Adventure already out of the harbour. The chief stayed on board till we were a full half league out
at sea; then took a most affectionate leave of me; and went away in a canoe, conducted by one man
and himself; all the others having gone long before. I was sorry that it was not convenient for me
to go on shore with him, to see in what manner these people would have been punished; for I am
satisfied, this was what brought him on board.</p><p>During our short stay at the small but fertile isle of Huaheine, we procured to both ships not
less than three hundred hogs, besides fowls and fruits; and, had we stayed longer, might have got
many more: For none of these articles of refreshment were seemingly diminished, but appeared every
where in as great abundance as ever.</p><p>Before we quitted this island, Captain Furneaux agreed to receive on board his ship a young man
named Omai, a native of Ulietea; where he had had some property, of which he had been dispossessed
by the people of Bolabola. I at first rather wondered that Captain Furneaux would encumber himself
with this man, who, in my opinion, was not a proper sample of the inhabitants of these happy
islands, not having any advantage of birth, or acquired rank; nor being eminent in shape, figure, or
complexion: For their people of the first rank are much fairer, and usually better behaved, and more
intelligent, than the middling class of people, among whom Omai is to be ranked. I have, however,
since my arrival in England, been convinced of my error: For excepting his complexion (which is
undoubtedly of a deeper hue than that of the <emph rend="italic">Earees</emph>, or gentry, who, as
in other countries, live a more luxurious life, and are less exposed to the heat of the sun), I much
doubt whether any other of the natives would have given more general satisfaction by his behaviour
among us. Omai has most certainly a very good understanding, quick parts, and honest principles; he
has a natural good behaviour, which rendered him acceptable to the best company; and a proper degree
of pride, which taught him to avoid the society of persons of inferior rank. He has passions of the
same kind as other young men, but has judgment enough not to indulge them in any improper excess. I
do not imagine that he has any dislike to liquor, and if he had fallen into company where the person
who drank the most met with the most approbation, I have no doubt, but that he would have
endeavoured to gain the applause of those with whom he associated; but, fortunately for him, he
perceived that drinking was very little in use but among inferior people, and as he was very
watchful into the manners and conduct of the persons of rank who honoured him with their protection,
he was sober and modest, and I never heard that, during the whole time of his stay in England, which
was two years, he ever once was disguised with wine, or ever shewed an inclination to go beyond the
strictest rules of moderation.</p><p>Soon after his arrival in London, the Earl of Sandwich, the first Lord of the Admiralty,
introduced him to his majesty at Kew, when he met with a most gracious reception, and imbibed the
strongest impression of duty and gratitude to that great and amiable prince, which I am persuaded he
will preserve to the latest moment of his life. During his stay among us he was caressed by many of
the principal nobility, and did nothing to forfeit the esteem of any one of them; but his principal
patrons were the Earl of Sandwich, Mr Banks, and Dr Solander; the former probably thought it a duty
of his office to protect and countenance an inhabitant of that hospitable country, where the wants
and distresses of those in his department had been alleviated and supplied in the most ample manner;
the others, as a testimony of their gratitude for the generous reception they had met with during
their residence in his country. It is to be observed, that though Omai lived in the midst of
amusements during his residence in England, his return to his native country was always in his
thoughts, and though he was not impatient to go, he expressed a satisfaction as the time of his
return approached. He embarked with me in the Resolution, when she was fitted out for another
voyage, loaded with presents from his several friends, and full of gratitude for the kind reception
and treatment he had experienced among us.</p></div><div type="chapter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N"><head><l>CHAPTER XIII.</l><l><emph rend="italic">Arrival at, and Departure of the Ships from, Ulietea: With an Account of what
happened there, and of Oedidee, one of the Natives, coming away in the Resolution.</emph></l></head><p><date>1773 September</date></p><p>The chief was no sooner gone, than we made sail for Ulietea (where I intended to stop a few
days). Arriving off the harbour of Ohamaneno at the close of the day, we spent the night making
short boards. It was dark, but we were sufficiently guided by the fishers lights on the reefs and
shores of the isles. The next morning, after making a few trips, we gained the entrance of the
harbour; and, as the wind blew directly out, I sent a boat to lie in soundings, that we might know
when to anchor. As soon as the signal was made by her, we borrowed close to the south point of the
channel; and, with our sails set, shooting within the boat, we anchored in seventeen fathoms water.
We then carried out anchors and hawsers, to warp in by; and, as soon as the Resolution was out of
the way, the Adventure came up in like manner, and warped in by the Resolution. The warping in, and
mooring the ships, took up the whole day.</p><p>We were no sooner at anchor at the entrance of the harbour, than the natives crowded round us in
their canoes with hogs and fruit. The latter they exchanged for nails and beads; the former we
refused as yet, having already as many on board as we could manage. Several we were, however,
obliged to take, as many of the principal people brought off little pigs, pepper, or eavoa-root, and
young plantain trees, and handed them into the ship, or put them into the boats along-side, whether
we would or no; for if we refused to take them on board, they would throw them into the boats. In
this manner, did these good people welcome us to their country.</p><p>I had forgot to mention, that Tupia was much enquired after at Huaheine; but, at this place,
every one asked about him, and the occasion of his death; and, like true philosophers, were
perfectly satisfied with the answers we gave them. Indeed, as we had nothing but the truth to tell,
the story was the same, by whomsoever told.</p><p>Next morning we paid a formal visit to Oreo, the chief of this part of the isle, carrying with us
the necessary presents. We went through no sort of ceremony at landing, but were at once conducted
to him. He was seated in his own house, which stood near the water side, where he and his friends
received us with great cordiality. He expressed much satisfaction at seeing me again, and desired
that we might exchange names, which I accordingly agreed to. I believe this is the strongest mark of
friendship they can show to a stranger. He enquired after Tupia, and all the gentlemen, by name, who
were with me when I first visited the island. After we had made the chief and his friends the
necessary presents, we went on board with a hog, and some fruit, received from him in return; and in
the <time>afternoon</time> he gave me another hog, still larger, without asking for the least acknowledgment.
Exchanges for fruit, &amp;c. were mostly carried on alongside the ships. I attempted to trade for
these articles on shore, but did not succeed, as the most of them were brought in canoes from
distant parts, and carried directly to the ships.</p><p>After breakfast, on the 10th, Captain Furneaux and I paid the chief a visit; and we were
entertained by him with such a comedy, or dramatic <emph rend="italic">heava</emph>, as is generally
acted in these isles. The music consisted of three drums, the actors were seven men, and one woman,
the chief's daughter. The only entertaining part in the drama, was a theft committed by a man and
his accomplice, in such a masterly manner, as sufficiently displayed the genius of the people in
this vice. The theft is discovered before the thief has time to carry off his prize; then a scuffle
ensues with those set to guard it, who, though four to two, are beat off the stage, and the thief
and his accomplices bear away their plunder in triumph. I was very attentive to the whole of this
part, being in full expectation that it would have ended very differently. For I had before been
informed that <emph rend="italic">Teto</emph> (that is, the Thief) was to be acted, and had
understood that the theft was to be punished with death, or a good <emph rend="italic">tiparahying</emph> (or beating), a punishment, we are told, they inflict on such as are guilty of
this crime. Be this as it may, strangers are certainly excluded from the protection of this law;
them they rob with impunity, on every occasion that offers. After the play was over, we returned on
board to dinner; and in the cool of the evening took a walk on shore, where we learnt from one of
the natives, that nine small islands, two of which were uninhabited, lay to the westward, at no
great distance from hence.</p><p>On the 11th, early in the morning, I had a visit from Oreo and his son, a youth about twelve
years of age. The latter brought me a hog and some fruit; for which I made him a present of an axe,
and dressed him in a shirt, and other things, which made him not a little proud of himself. Having
staid some hours, they went on shore; as I also did soon after, but to another part. The chief
hearing I was on shore, came to the place where he found the boat, into which he put a hog and a
quantity of fruit, without saying a word to any body, and, with some of his friends, came on board,
and dined with us. After dinner I had a visit from Oo-oorou, the principal chief of the isle. He was
introduced to us by Oreo, and brought with him, as a present, a large hog, for which I made him a
handsome return. Oreo employed himself in buying hogs for me (for we now began to take of them), and
he made such bargains as I had reason to be satisfied with. At length they all took leave, after
making me promise to visit them next morning; which I accordingly did, in company with several of
the officers and gentlemen. Oreo ordered an <emph rend="italic">heava</emph> to be acted for our
entertainment, in which two very pretty young women were the actresses. This <emph rend="italic">heava</emph> was somewhat different from the one I saw before, and not so entertaining. Oreo, after
it was over, accompanied us on board, together with two of his friends.</p><p>The following day was spent much in the same manner; and early in the morning of the 14th, I sent
Mr Pickersgill, with the Resolution's launch, and Adventure's cutter, to Otaha, to procure an
additional supply of bananoes, and plantains, for a sea-store; for we could get little more of these
articles at Ulietea than were sufficient for present consumption. Oreo, and some of his friends,
paid me a pretty early visit this morning. I acquainted the chief, that I would dine with him, and
desired he would order two pigs to be dressed after their manner, which he accordingly did, and,
about <time>one o'clock</time>, I, and the officers and gentlemen of both ships, went to partake of them. When we
came to the chiefs house, we found the cloth laid; that is, green leaves were strewed thick on the
floor. Round them we seated ourselves; presently one of the pigs came over my head souce upon the
leaves, and immediately after the other; both so hot as hardly to be touched. The table was
garnished round with hot bread-fruit and plantains, and a quantity of cocoa-nuts brought for drink.
Each man being ready, with his knife in his hand, we turned to without ceremony; and it must be
owned, in favour of their cookery, that victuals were never cleaner, nor better dressed. For, though
the pigs were served up whole, and one weighed between fifty and sixty pounds, and the other about
half as much, yet all the parts were equally well done, and eat much sweeter than if dressed in any
of our methods. The chief and his son, and some other of his male friends, eat with us, and pieces
were handed to others who sat behind: For we had a vast crowd about us; so that it might be truly
said we dined in public. The chief never failed to drink his glass of Madeira whenever it came to
his turn, not only now, but at all other times when he dined with us, without ever being once
affected by it. As soon as we had dined, the boat's crew took the remainder; and by them, and those
about them, the whole was consumed. When we rose up, many of the common people rushed in, to pick up
the crumbs which had fallen, and for which they searched the leaves very narrowly. This leads me to
believe, that though there is plenty of pork at these isles, but little falls to their share. Some
of our gentlemen being present when these pigs were killed and dressed, observed the chief to divide
the entrails, lard, &amp;c. into ten or twelve equal parts, and serve it out to certain people.
Several daily attended the ships, and assisted the butchers, for the sake of the entrails of the
hogs we killed. Probably little else falls to the share of the common people. It however must be
owned, that they are exceedingly careful of every kind of provision, and waste nothing that can be
eaten by man; flesh and fish especially.</p><p>In the <time>afternoon</time> we were entertained with a play. Plays, indeed, had been acted almost every day
since we had been here, either to entertain <emph rend="italic">us</emph>, or for their own
amusement, or perhaps both.</p><p>Next morning produced some circumstances which fully prove the timorous disposition of these
people. We were surprised to find that none of them came off to the ships as usual. Two men
belonging to the Adventure having staid on shore all night, contrary to orders, my first conjectures
were, that the natives had stripped them, and were now afraid to come near us, lest we should take
some step to revenge the insult; but in order to be better satisfied, Captain Furneaux and I went
ashore to Oreo's house, which we found quite empty; he and all his family gone, and the whole
neighbourhood, in a manner, quite deserted. The two men belonging to the Adventure made their
appearance, and informed us that they had been very civilly treated by the natives, but could give
no account of the cause of their precipitate flight. All that we could learn from the very few that
durst come near us, was, that severals were killed, others wounded by our guns, pointing out to us
where the balls went in and out of the body, &amp;c. This relation gave me a good deal of uneasiness
for the safety of our people gone to Otaha, fearing that some disturbance had happened at that
island. However, in order to be better informed, I determined, if possible, to see the chief
himself. Accordingly we embarked in our boat, having one of the natives with us, and rowed along
shore to the northward, the way we were told he was gone. We soon came in sight of the canoe in
which he was; but before we could come up with her he had got on shore. We landed presently after,
and found he was gone still farther. An immense crowd, however, waited our landing, who entreated me
to follow him. One man offered to carry me on his back; but the whole story appearing rather more
mysterious than ever, and being all unarmed, I did not choose to separate myself from the boat, but
embarked again, and rowed after him. We soon came before the place where our guide told us he was,
and put in the boat accordingly. It grounded at some distance from the shore, where we were met by a
venerable old lady, wife to the chief. She threw herself into my arms, and wept bitterly, insomuch
that it was not possible to get one plain word from her. With this old lady in my hand I went
ashore, contrary to the advice of my young man from Otaheite, who was more afraid than any of us,
probably believing every word the people had told us. I found the chief seated under the shade of a
house, before which was a large area, and surrounded by a vast number of people. As soon as I came
to him, he threw his arms about me, and burst into tears, in which he was accompanied by all the
women, and some of the men, so that the lamentation became general; astonishment alone kept me from
joining with them. It was some time before I could get a word from any one; at last, all my
enquiries gave me no other information, than that they were alarmed on account of our boats being
absent, thinking that the people in them had deserted from us, and that I should take some violent
means to recover them. For when we assured them that the boats would return back, they seemed
cheerful and satisfied, and to a man, denied that any one was hurt, either of their own or our
people, and so it afterwards proved. Nor did it appear that there was the least foundation for these
alarms, nor could we ever find out by what means this general consternation first took its rise.
After a stay of about an hour, I returned on board, three of the natives coming along with us, who
proclaimed the peace as we rowed along shore to all they saw.</p><p>Thus matters were again restored to their former footing, and the next morning they came off to
the ships as usual. After breakfast, Captain Furneaux and I paid the chief a visit; we found him at
his own house perfectly easy, insomuch that he and some of his friends came on board and dined with
us. I was now told that my Otaheitean young man, Poreo, had taken a resolution to leave me. I have
just mentioned <emph rend="italic">before</emph>, his being with us when I followed Oreo, and his
advising me not to go on shore. He was so much afraid at that time, that he remained in the boat
till he heard all matters were reconciled; then he came out, and presently after, met with a young
woman, for whom he had contracted a friendship. Having my powder-horn in keeping, he came and gave
it to one of my people who was by me, and then went away with her, and I saw him no more.</p><p>In the <time>afternoon</time>, our boats returned from Otaha, pretty well laden with plantains, an article we
were most in want of. They made the circuit of the island, conducted by one of the Earees, whose
name was Boba, and were hospitably entertained by the people, who provided them with victuals and
lodging. The first night, they were entertained with a play, the second, their repose was disturbed
by the natives stealing their military chest. This put them on making reprisals, by which means they
recovered the most of what they had lost.</p><p>Having now got on board a large supply of refreshments, I determined to put to sea the next
morning, and made the same known to the chief, who promised to see me again before we departed. At
<time>four o'clock</time> we began to unmoor; and as soon as it was light, Oreo, his son, and some of his
friends, came aboard. Many canoes also came off with fruit and hogs, the latter they even begged of
us to take from them, calling out <emph rend="italic">Tiyo boa atoi</emph>.—I am your friend, take
my hog, and give me an axe. But our decks were already so full of them, that we could hardly move,
having, on board both ships, between three and four hundred. By the increase of our stock, together
with what we had salted and consumed, I judge that we got at this island 400 or upwards; many,
indeed, were only roasters, others again weighed one hundred pounds, or upwards, but the general run
was from forty to sixty. It is not easy to say how many we might have got, could we have found room
for all that were offered us.</p><p>The chief, and his friends, did not leave me till we were under sail, and before he went away,
pressed me much to know, if I would not return, and when? Questions which were daily put to me by
many of these islanders. My Otaheitean youth's leaving me proved of no consequence, as many young
men of this island voluntarily offered to come away with us. I thought proper to take on board one,
who was about seventeen or eighteen years of age, named Oedidee, a native of Bolabola, and a near
relation of the great Opoony, chief of that island. Soon after we were out of the harbour, and had
made sail, we observed a canoe following us, conducted by two men; whereupon I brought-to, and they
presently came alongside, having brought me a present of roasted fruit and roots from Oreo. I made
them a proper return before I dismissed them, and then set sail to the west, with the Adventure in
company.</p></div><div type="chapter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N"><head><l>CHAPTER XIV.</l><l><emph rend="italic">An Account of a Spanish Ship visiting Otaheite; the present State of the
Islands; with some Observations on the Diseases and Customs of the Inhabitants; and some Mistakes
concerning the Women corrected.</emph></l></head><p><date>1773 September</date></p><p>I shall now give some farther account of these islands; for, although I have been pretty minute
in relating the daily transactions, some things, which are rather interesting, have been
omitted.</p><p>Soon after our arrival at Otaheite, we were informed that a ship about the size of the
Resolution, had been in at Owhaiurua harbour, near the S.E. end of the island, where she remained
about three weeks; and had been gone about three months before we arrived. We were told that four of
the natives were gone away with her, whose names were Debedebea, Paoodou, Tanadooee, and Opahiah. At
this time, we conjectured this was a French ship, but, on our arrival at the Cape of Good Hope, we
learnt she was a Spaniard, which had been sent out from America. The Otaheiteans complained of a
disease communicated to them by the people in this ship, which they said affected the head, throat,
and stomach, and at length killed them. They seemed to dread it much, and were continually enquiring
if we had it. This ship they distinguished by the name of <emph rend="italic">Pahai no Pep-pe</emph>
(ship of Peppe), and called the disease <emph rend="italic">Apa no Pep-pe</emph>, just as they call
the venereal disease <emph rend="italic">Apa no Pretane</emph> (English disease), though they, to a
man, say it was brought to the isle by M. de Bougainville; but I have already observed that they
thought M. de Bougainville came from <emph rend="italic">Pretane</emph>, as well as every other ship
which has touched at the isle.</p><p>Were it not for this assertion of the natives, and none of Captain Wallis's people being affected
with the venereal disease, either while they were at Otaheite, or after they left it, I should have
concluded that long before these islanders were visited by Europeans, this or some disease which is
near akin to it, had existed amongst them. For I have heard them speak of people dying of a disorder
which we interpreted to be the pox before that period. But, be this as it will, it is now far less
common amongst them, than it was in the year 1769, when I first visited these isles. They say they
can cure it, and so it fully appears, for, notwithstanding most of my people had made pretty free
with the women, very few of them were afterwards affected with the disorder; and those who were, had
it in so slight a manner, that it is easily removed. But among the natives, whenever it turns to a
pox, they tell us it is incurable. Some of our people pretend to have seen some of them who had this
last disorder in a high degree, but the surgeon, who made it his business to enquire, could never
satisfy himself in this point. These people are, and were, before Europeans visited them, very
subject to scrophulous diseases, so that a seaman might easily mistake one disorder for another.</p><p>The island of Otaheite, which, in the years 1767 and 1768, as it were, swarmed with hogs and
fowls, was now so ill supplied with these animals, that hardly any thing could induce the owners to
part with them. The few they had at this time, among them, seemed to be at the disposal of the
kings. For while we lay at Oaitipiha Bay, in the kingdom of Tiarrabou, or lesser peninsula, every
hog or fowl we saw we were told belonged to Waheatoua; and all we saw in the kingdom of Opoureonu,
or the greater peninsula, belonged to Otoo. During the seventeen days we were at this island, we got
but twenty-four hogs, the half of which came from the two kings themselves; and, I believe, the
other half were sold us by their permission or order. We were, however, abundantly supplied with all
the fruits the island produces, except bread-fruit, which was not in season either at this or the
other isles. Cocoa-nuts and plantains were what we got the most of; the latter, together with a few
yams and other roots, were to us a succedaneum for bread. At Otaheite we got great plenty of apples,
and a fruit like a nectarine, called by them <emph rend="italic">Aheeva</emph>. This fruit was
common to all the isles; but apples we got only at Otaheite, and found them of infinite use to the
scorbutic people. Of all the seeds that have been brought to those islands by Europeans, none have
succeeded but pumpkins; and these they do not like, which is not to be wondered at.</p><p>The scarcity of hogs at Otaheite may be owing to two causes; first, to the number which have been
consumed, and carried off by the shipping which have touched here of late years; and, secondly, to
the frequent wars between the two kingdoms. We know of two since the year 1767; at present a peace
subsists between them, though they do not seem to entertain much friendship for each other. I never
could learn the cause of the late war, nor who got the better in the conflict. In the battle, which
put an end to the dispute, many were killed on both sides. On the part of Opoureonu, fell Toutaha,
and several other chiefs, who were mentioned to me by name. Toutaha lies interred in the family
Marai at Oparree; and his mother, and several other women who were of his household, are now taken
care of by Otoo, the reigning prince—a man who, at first, did not appear to us to much advantage. I
know but little of Waheatoua of Tiarrabou. This prince, who is not above twenty years of age,
appeared with all the gravity of a man of fifty. His subjects do not uncover before him, or pay him
any outward obeisance as is done to Otoo; nevertheless, they seem to shew him full as much respect,
and he appeared in rather more state. He was attended by a few middle-aged, or elderly men, who
seemed to be his counsellors. This is what appeared to me to be the then state of Otaheite. The
other islands, that is, Huaheine, Ulietea, and Otaha, were in a more flourishing state than they
were when I was there before. Since that time, they had enjoyed the blessing of peace; the people
seemed to be as happy as any under heaven; and well they may, for they possess not only the
necessaries, but many of the luxuries of life in the greatest profusion; and my young man told me
that hogs, fowls, and fruits, are in equal plenty at Bola-bola, a thing which Tupia would never
allow. To clear up this seeming contradiction, I must observe, that the one was prejudiced against,
and the other in favour of, this isle.</p><p>The produce of the islands, the manners and customs of the natives, &amp;c. having been treated
at large in the narrative of my former voyage, it will be unnecessary to take notice of these
subjects in this, unless where I can add new matter, or clear up any mistakes which may have been
committed.</p><p>As I had some reason to believe, that amongst their religious customs, human sacrifices were
sometimes considered as necessary, I went one day to a <emph rend="italic">Marai</emph> in Matavai,
in company with Captain Furneaux; having with us, as I had upon all other occasions, one of my men
who spoke their language tolerably well, and several of the natives, one of whom appeared to be an
intelligent sensible man. In the <emph rend="italic">Marai</emph> was a <emph rend="italic">Tupapow</emph>, on which lay a corpse and some viands; so that every thing promised success to my
enquiries. I began with asking questions relating to the several objects before me, if the
plantains, &amp;c. were for the <emph rend="italic">Eatua</emph>? If they sacrificed to the <emph rend="italic">Eatua</emph>, hogs, dogs, fowls, &amp;c.? To all of which he answered in the
affirmative. I then asked, If they sacrificed men to the <emph rend="italic">Eatua</emph>? He
answered <emph rend="italic">Taata eno</emph>; that is, bad men they did, first <emph rend="italic">Tipperahy</emph>, or beating them till they were dead. I then asked him, If good men were put to
death in this manner? His answer was No, only <emph rend="italic">Taata eno</emph>. I asked him if
any <emph rend="italic">Earees</emph> were? He said, they had hogs to give to the <emph rend="italic">Eatua</emph>, and again repeated <emph rend="italic">Taatu eno</emph>. I next asked,
If <emph rend="italic">Towtows</emph>, that is, servants or slaves, who had no hogs, dogs, or fowls,
but yet were good men, if they were sacrificed to the <emph rend="italic">Eatua</emph>? His answer
was No, only bad men. I asked him several more questions, and all his answers seemed to tend to this
one point, that men for certain crimes were condemned to be sacrificed to the gods, provided they
had not wherewithal to redeem themselves. This, I think, implies, that on some occasions, human
sacrifices are considered as necessary, particularly when they take such men as have, by the laws of
their country, forfeited their lives, and have nothing to redeem them; and such will generally be
found among the lower class of people.</p><p>The man of whom I made these enquiries, as well as some others, took some pains to explain the
whole of this custom to us; but we were not masters enough of their language to understand them. I
have since learnt from Omai, that they offer human sacrifices to the Supreme Being. According to his
account, what men shall be so sacrificed, depends on the caprice of the high priest, who, when they
are assembled on any solemn occasion, retires alone into the house of God, and stays there some
time. When he comes out, he informs them, that he has seen and conversed with their great God (the
high priest alone having that privilege), and that he has asked for a human sacrifice, and tells
them that he has desired such a person, naming a man present, whom, most probably, the priest has an
antipathy against. He is immediately killed, and so falls a victim to the priest's resentment, who,
no doubt (if necessary), has address enough to persuade the people that he was a bad man. If I
except their funeral ceremonies, all the knowledge that has been obtained of their religion, has
been from information: And as their language is but imperfectly understood, even by those who
pretend to the greatest knowledge of it, very little on this head is yet known with certainty.</p><p>The liquor which they make from the plant called <emph rend="italic">Ava ava</emph>, is expressed
from the root, and not from the leaves, as mentioned in the narrative of my former voyage. The
manner of preparing this liquor is as simple as it is disgusting to an European. It is thus: Several
people take some of the root, and chew it till it is soft and pulpy, then they spit it out into a
platter or other vessel, every one into the same; when a sufficient quantity is chewed, more or less
water is put to it, according as it is to be strong or weak; the juice, thus diluted, is strained
through some fibrous stuff like fine shavings; after which it is fit for drinking, and this is
always done immediately. It has a pepperish taste, drinks flat, and rather insipid. But, though it
is intoxicating I only saw one instance where it had that effect, as they generally drink it with
great moderation, and but little at a time. Sometimes they chew this root in their mouths, as
Europeans do tobacco, and swallow their spittle; and sometimes I have seen them eat it wholly.</p><p>At Ulietea they cultivate great quantities of this plant. At Otaheite but very little. I believe
there are but few islands in this sea, that do not produce more or less of it; and the natives apply
it to the same use, as appears by Le Mair's account of Horn Island, in which he speaks of the
natives making a liquor from a plant in the same manner as above mentioned.</p><p>Great injustice has been done the women of Otaheite, and the Society isles, by those who have
represented them, without exception, as ready to grant the last favour to any man who will come up
to their price. But this is by no means the case; the favours of married women, and also the
unmarried of the better sort, are as difficult to be obtained here, as in any other country
whatever. Neither can the charge be understood indiscriminately of the unmarried of the lower class,
for many of these admit of no such familiarities. That there are prostitutes here, as well as in
other countries, is very true, perhaps more in proportion, and such were those who came on board the
ships to our people, and frequented the post we had on shore. By seeing these mix indiscriminately
with those of a different turn, even of the first rank, one is at first inclined to think that they
are all disposed the same way, and that the only difference is in the price. But the truth is, the
woman who becomes a prostitute does not seem, in their opinion, to have committed a crime of so deep
a dye as to exclude her from the esteem and society of the community in general. On the whole, a
stranger who visits England might, with equal justice, draw the characters of the women there, from
those which he might meet with on board the ships in one of the naval ports, or in the purlieus of
Covent-Garden and Drury-Lane. I must however allow, that they are all completely versed in the art
of coquetry, and that very few of them fix any bounds to their conversation. It is therefore no
wonder that they have obtained the character of libertines.</p><p>To what hath been said of the geography of these isles, in the narrative of my former voyage, I
shall now only add, that we found the latitude of Oaiti-piha Bay, in Otaheite, to be <geo select="lat" n="1">17° 43' S</geo>26"outh, and the longitude 0° 21' 25.5" east from Point Venus; or <geo select="lon" n="1">149° 13' W</geo>24"est from Greenwich.
The difference both of latitude and longitude, between Point Venus and Oaiti- piha, is greater than
I supposed it to be, when I made the circuit of the island in 1769, by two miles, and 4-3/4 miles
respectively. It is therefore highly probable, that the whole island is of a greater extent than I,
at that time, estimated it to be. The astronomers set up their observatory, and made their
observations on Point Venus, the latitude of which they found to be <geo select="lat">17° 29' 13" S</geo>outh. This differs
but two seconds from that which Mr Green and I found; and its longitude, viz. <geo select="lon">149° 34' 49.5" W</geo>est,
for any thing that is yet known to the contrary, is as exact.</p><p>Mr Kendal's watch was found to be gaining on mean time 8" 863 per day, which is only 0" 142 less
than at Queen Charlotte's Sound, consequently its error in longitude was trifling.</p></div></div><div type="book" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N"><head><l>A VOYAGE TOWARDS THE SOUTH POLE, AND ROUND THE WORLD.</l></head><head><l>BOOK II.</l></head><head><l>FROM OUR DEPARTURE FROM THE SOCIETY ISLES, TO OUR RETURN TO AND LEAVING THEM THE SECOND TIME.</l></head><div type="chapter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N"><head><l>CHAPTER I.</l><l><emph rend="italic">Passage from Ulietea to the Friendly Islands, with an Account of the Discovery
of Hervey's Island, and the Incidents that happened at Middleburg.</emph></l></head><p><date>1773 September</date></p><p>After leaving Ulietea, as before mentioned, I steered to the west, inclining to the south, to get
clear of the tracts of former navigators, and to get into the latitude of the islands of Middleburgh
and Amsterdam; for I intended to run as far west as these islands, and to touch there if I found it
convenient, before I hauled up for New Zealand. I generally lay-to every night, lest we might pass
any land in the dark. Part of the 21st and 22d the wind blew from N.W., attended with thunder,
lightning, and rain, having a large swell from S.S.E. and S., which kept up for several days,— an
indication that no land was near us in that direction.</p><p>On the 23d, at <time>ten o'clock  in the morning</time>, land was seen from the top-mast head, and at <time>noon</time> from
the deck, extending from S. by W. to S.W. by S. We hauled up for it with the wind at S.E., and found
it to consist of two or three small islets, connected together by breakers like most of the low
isles in the sea, lying in a triangular form, and about six leagues in circuit. They were clothed
with wood, among which were many cocoa-nut trees. We saw no people, or signs of inhabitants; and had
reason to think there were none. The situation of this isle, which is in the latitude of <geo select="lat">19° 18' S</geo>.,
longitude <geo select="lon">158° 54' W</geo>., is not very different from that assigned by Mr Dalrymple to La Dezena. But as
this is a point not easily determined, I named it Hervey's Island, in honour of the Honourable
Captain Hervey of the navy, one of the lords of the Admiralty, and afterwards Earl of Bristol.</p><p>As the landing on this isle, if practicable, would have caused a delay which I could ill spare at
this time, we resumed our course to the west; and on the 25th we again began to use our
sea-biscuits, the fruit which had served as a succedaneum being all consumed; but our stock of fresh
pork still continued, each man having as much every day as was needful. In our route to the west we
now and then saw men-of-war and tropic birds, and a small sea-bird, which is seldom seen but near
the shores of the isles; we, therefore, conjectured that we had passed some land at no great
distance. As we advanced to the west, the variation of the compass gradually increased, so that on
the 29th, being in the latitude of <geo select="lat">21° 26' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">170° 40' W</geo>., it was <geo select="lon">10° 45' E</geo>.</p><p><date>1773 October</date></p><p>At <time>two o'clock</time> p.m. on the 1st of October, we made the island of Middleburg, bearing W.S.W.; at
<time>six o'clock</time> it extended from S.W. by W. to N.W., distant four leagues, at which time another land
was seen in the direction of N.N.W. The wind being at S.S.E., I hauled to the south, in order to get
round the south end of the island before the morning; but at <time>eight o'clock</time> a small island was seen
lying off it, and not knowing but they might be connected by a reef, the extent of which we must be
ignorant of, I resolved to spend the night where we were. At day-break the next morning, we bore up
for the S.W. side of Middleburg, passing between it and the little isle above mentioned, where we
found a clear channel two miles broad.</p><p>After ranging the S.W. side of the greater isle, to about two-thirds of its length, at the
distance of half a mile from the shore, without seeing the least prospect of either anchorage or
landing-place, we bore away for Amsterdam, which we had in sight. We had scarcely turned our sails
before we observed the shores of Middleburg to assume another aspect, seeming to offer both
anchorage and landing. Upon this we hauled the wind, and plied in under the island. In the mean
time, two canoes, each conducted by two or three men, came boldly alongside; and some of them
entered the ship without hesitation. This mark of confidence gave me a good opinion of these
islanders, and determined me to visit them, if possible. After making a few trips, we found good
anchorage, and came to in twenty-five fathoms water, and gravel bottom, at three cables' length from
the shore. The highest land on the island bore S.E. by E.; the north point N.E. 1/2 E., and the west
S. by W. 1/2 W., and the island of Amsterdam extending from N. by W. 1/2 W. to N.W. 1/2 W. We had
scarcely got to an anchor before we were surrounded by a great number of canoes full of people, who
had brought with them cloth, and other curiosities, which they exchanged for nails, &amp;c. Several
came on board; among them was one whom, by the authority he seemed to have over the others, I found
was a chief, and accordingly made him a present of a hatchet, spike-nails, and several other
articles, with which he was highly pleased. Thus I obtained the friendship of this chief, whose name
was Tioony.</p><p>Soon after, a party of us embarked in two boats, in company with Tioony, who conducted us to a
little creek formed by the rocks, right abreast of the ships, where landing was extremely easy, and
the boats secure against the surf. Here we found an immense crowd of people, who welcomed us on
shore with loud acclamations. Not one of them had so much as a stick, or any other weapon in their
hands; an indubitable sign of their pacific intentions. They thronged so thick round the boats with
cloth, matting, &amp;c. to exchange for nails, that it was some time before we could get room to
land. They seemed to be more desirous to give than receive; for many who could not get near the
boats, threw into them, over the others heads, whole bales of cloth, and then retired, without
either asking, or waiting for any thing in return. At length the chief caused them to open to the
right and left, and make room for us to land. He then conducted us up to his house, which was
situated about three hundred yards from the sea, at the head of a fine lawn, and under the shade of
some shaddock trees. The situation was most delightful. In front was the sea, and the ships at
anchor; behind, and on each side, were plantations, in which were some of the richest productions of
Nature. The floor was laid with mats, on which we were seated, and the people seated themselves in a
circle round us on the outside. Having the bagpipes with us, I ordered them to be played; and in
return, the chief directed three young women to sing a song, which they did with a very good grace;
and having made each of them a present, this immediately set all the women in the circle a-singing.
Their songs were musical and harmonious, and nowise harsh or disagreeable. After sitting here some
time, we were, at our own request, conducted into one of the adjoining plantations, where the chief
had another house, into which we were introduced. Bananoes and cocoa-nuts were set before us to eat,
and a bowl of liquor prepared in our presence of the juice of <emph rend="italic">Eava</emph> for us
to drink. Pieces of the root were first offered us to chew; but as we excused ourselves from
assisting in the operation, this was performed by others. When sufficiently chewed, it was put into
a large wooden bowl; then mixed with water, in the manner already related; and as soon as it was
properly strained for drinking, they made cups, by folding of green leaves, which held near half a
pint, and presented to each of us one of these filled with the liquor. But I was the only one who
tasted it; the manner of brewing it having quenched the thirst of every one else. The bowl was,
however; soon emptied of its contents, of which both men and women partook. I observed that they
never filled the same cup twice; nor did two persons drink out of the same; each had a fresh cup and
fresh liquor.</p><p>This house was situated at one corner of the plantation, and had an area before it on which we
were seated. The whole was planted round with fruit and other trees, whose spreading branches
afforded an agreeable shade, and whose fragrance diffused a pleasing odour through the air.</p><p>Before we had well viewed the plantation it was <time>noon</time>, and we returned on board to dinner, with
the chief in our company. He sat at table but eat nothing, which, as we had fresh pork roasted, was
a little extraordinary. After dinner we landed again, and were received by the crowd as before; Mr
Forster with his botanical party, and some of the officers and gentlemen, walked into the country.
Captain Furneaux and myself were conducted to the chief's house, where fruit and some greens, which
had been stewed, were set before us to eat. As we had but just dined, it cannot be supposed we eat
much; but Oedidee, and Omai, the man on board the Adventure, did honour to the feast. After this we
signified our desire of seeing the country. Tioony very readily assented, and conducted us through
several plantations, which were laid out with great judgment, and inclosed with very neat fences
made of reeds. They were all in very good order, and well planted with various fruit-trees, roots,
&amp;c. The chief took some pains to let us know the most of them belonged to himself. Near some of
the houses, and in the lanes that divided the plantations, were running about some hogs and very
large fowls, which were the only domestic animals we saw; and these they did not seem willing to
part with. Nor did any one, during the whole day, offer in exchange any fruit, or roots, worth
mentioning, which determined me to leave this island, and to visit that of Amsterdam.</p><p>The evening brought every one on board, highly delighted with the country, and the very obliging
behaviour of the inhabitants, who seemed to vie with each other in doing what they thought would
give us pleasure. The ships were crowded with people the whole day, trafficking with those on board,
in which the greatest good order was observed; and I was sorry that the season of the year would not
admit of my making a longer stay with them. Early the nest morning, while the ships were getting
under sail, I went on shore with Captain Furneaux and Mr Forster, to take leave of the chief. He met
us at the landing-place, and would have conducted us to his house, had we not excused ourselves. We
therefore were seated on the grass, where we spent about half an hour in the midst of a vast crowd
of people. After making the chief a present, consisting of various articles, and an assortment of
garden-seeds, I gave him to understand that we were going away, at which he seemed not at all moved.
He, and two or three more, came into our boat, in order to accompany us on board; but seeing the
Resolution under sail, he called to a canoe to put alongside, into which he and his friends went,
and returned on shore. While he remained in our boat, he continued to exchange fish-hooks for nails,
and engrossed the trade in a manner wholly to himself; but, when on shore, I never saw him make the
least exchange.</p></div><div type="chapter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N"><head><l>CHAPTER II.</l><l><emph rend="italic">The Arrival of the Ships at Amsterdam; a Description of a Place of Worship; and
an Account of the Incidents which happened while we remained at that Island.</emph></l></head><p><date>1773 October</date></p><p>As soon as I was on board, we made sail down to Amsterdam. The people of this isle were so little
afraid of us, that some met us in three canoes about midway between the two isles. They used their
utmost efforts to get on board, but without effect, as we did not shorten sail for them, and the
rope which we gave them broke. They then attempted to board the Adventure, and met with the same
disappointment. We ran along the S.W. coast of Amsterdam at half a mile from shore, on which the sea
broke in a great surf. We had an opportunity, by the help of our glasses, to view the face of the
island, every part of which seemed to be laid out in plantations. We observed the natives running
along the shore, displaying small white flags, which we took for ensigns of peace, and answered them
by hoisting a St George's ensign. Three men belonging to Middleburg, who, by some means or other,
had been left on board the Adventure, now quitted her, and swam to the shore; not knowing that we
intended to stop at this isle, and having no inclination, as may be supposed, to go away with
us.</p><p>As soon as we opened the west side of the isle, we were met by several canoes, each conducted by
three or four men. They came boldly alongside, presented us with some <emph rend="italic">Eava</emph> root, and then came on board without farther ceremony, inviting us, by all the friendly
signs they could make, to go to their island, and pointing to the place where we should anchor; at
least we so understood them. After a few boards, we anchored in Van Diemen's Road, in eighteen
fathoms water, little more than a cable's length from the breakers, which line the coast. We carried
out the coasting-anchor and cable to seaward, to keep the ship from tailing on the rocks, in case of
a shift of wind or a calm. This last anchor lay in forty-seven fathoms water; so steep was the bank
on which we anchored. By this time we were crowded with people; some came off in canoes, and others
swam; but, like those of the other isle, brought nothing with them but cloth, matting, &amp;c., for
which the seamen only bartered away their clothes. As it was probable they would soon feel the
effects of this kind of traffic, with a view to put a stop to it, and to obtain the necessary
refreshments, I gave orders that no sort of curiosities should be purchased by any person
whatever.</p><p>The good effect of this order was found in the morning. For, when the natives saw we would
purchase nothing but eatables, they brought off bananoes and cocoa-nuts in abundance, some fowls and
pigs; all of which they exchanged for small nails and pieces of cloth: even old rags of any sort,
was enough for a pig, or a fowl.</p><p>Matters being thus established, and proper persons appointed to trade under the direction of the
officers, to prevent disputes, after breakfast I landed, accompanied by Captain Furneaux, Mr
Forster, and several of the officers; having along with us a chief, or person of some note, whose
name was Attago, who had attached himself to me, from the first moment of his coming on board, which
was before we anchored. I know not how he came to discover that I was the commander; but, certain it
is, he was not long on deck before he singled me out from all the gentlemen, making me a present of
some cloth, and other things he had about him; and as a greater testimony of friendship, we now
exchanged names; a custom which is practised at Otaheite, and the Society Isles. We were lucky, or
rather we may thank the natives, for having anchored before a narrow creek in the rocks which line
the shore. To this creek we were conducted by my friend Attago; and there we landed dry on the
beach, and within the breakers, in the face of a vast crowd of people, who received us in the same
friendly manner that those of Middleburg had done.</p><p>As soon as we were landed; all the gentlemen set out into the country, accompanied by some of the
natives. But the most of them remained with Captain Furneaux and me, who amused ourselves some time
distributing presents amongst them; especially to such as Attago pointed out, which were not many,
but who I afterwards found, were of superior rank to himself. At this time, however, he seemed to be
the principal person, and to be obeyed as such. After we had spent some time on the beach, as we
complained of the heat, Attago immediately conducted and seated us under the shade of a tree,
ordering the people to form a circle round us. This they did, and never once attempted to push
themselves upon us like the Otaheiteans.</p><p>After sitting here some time, and distributing some presents to those about us, we signified our
desire to see the country. The chief immediately took the hint, and conducted us along a lane that
led to an open green, on the one side of which was a house of worship built on a mount that had been
raised by the hand of man, about sixteen or eighteen feet above the common level. It had an oblong
figure, and was inclosed by a wall or parapet of stone, about three feet in height. From this wall
the mount rose with a gentle slope, and was covered with a green turf. On the top of it stood the
house, which had the same figure as the mount, about twenty feet in length, and fourteen or sixteen
broad. As soon as we came before the place, every one seated himself on the green, about fifty or
sixty yards from the front of the house. Presently came three elderly men, who seated themselves
between us and it, and began a speech, which I understood to be a prayer, it being wholly directed
to the house. This lasted about ten minutes; and then the priests, for such I took them to be, came
and sat down along with us, when we made them presents of such things as were about us. Having then
made signs to them that we wanted to view the premises, my friend Attago immediately got up, and
going with us, without showing the least backwardness, gave us full liberty to examine every part of
it.</p><p>In the front were two stone steps leading to the top of the wall; from this the ascent to the
house was easy, round which was a fine gravel walk. The house was built, in all respects, like to
their common dwelling-houses; that is, with posts and rafters, and covered with palm thatch. The
eaves came down within about three feet of the ground, which space was filled up with strong matting
made of palm leaves, as a wall. The floor of the house was laid with fine gravel; except, in the
middle, where there was an oblong square of blue pebbles, raised about six inches higher than the
floor. At one corner of the house stood an image rudely carved in wood, and on one side lay another;
each about two feet in length. I, who had no intention to offend either them or their gods, did not
so much as touch them, but asked Attago, as well as I could, if they were <emph rend="italic">Eatuas</emph>, or gods. Whether he understood me or no, I cannot say; but he immediately turned
them over and over, in as rough a manner as he would have done any other log of wood, which
convinced me that they were not there as representatives of the Divinity. I was curious to know if
the dead were interred there, and asked Attago several questions relative thereto; but I was not
sure that he understood me, at least I did not understand the answers he made well enough to satisfy
my enquiries. For the reader must know, that at our first coming among these people, we hardly could
understand a word they said. Even my Otaheitean youth, and the man on board the Adventure, were
equally at a loss; but more of this by and by. Before we quitted the house we thought it necessary
to make an offering at the altar. Accordingly we laid down upon the blue pebbles, some medals,
nails, and several other things, which we had no sooner done than my friend Attago took them up, and
put them in his pocket. The stones with which the walls were made that inclosed this mount, were
some of them nine or ten feet by four, and about six inches thick. It is difficult to conceive how
they can cut such stones out of the coral rocks.</p><p>This mount stood in a kind of grove open only on the side which fronted the high road, and the
green on which the people were seated. At this green or open place, was a junction of five roads,
two or three of which appeared to be very public ones. The groves were composed of several sorts of
trees. Among others was the <emph rend="italic">Etoa</emph> tree, as it is called at Otaheite, of
which are made clubs, &amp;c. and a kind of low palm, which is very common in the northern parts of
New Holland.</p><p>After we had done examining this place of worship, which in their language is called <emph rend="italic">A-fia-tou-ca</emph>, we desired to return; but, instead of conducting us to the
water-side as we expected, they struck into a road leading into the country. This road, which was
about sixteen feet broad, and as level as a bowling-green, seemed to be a very public one; there
being many other roads from different parts, leading into it, all inclosed on each side, with neat
fences made of reeds, and shaded from the scorching sun by fruit trees, I thought I was transported
into the most fertile plains in Europe. There was not an inch of waste ground; the roads occupied no
more space than was absolutely necessary; the fences did not take up above four inches each; and
even this was not wholly lost, for in many were planted some useful trees or plants. It was
everywhere the same; change of place altered not the scene. Nature, assisted by a little art, no
where appears in more splendour than at this isle. In these delightful walks we met numbers of
people; some travelling down to the ships with their burdens of fruit; others returning back empty.
They all gave us the road, by turning either to the right or left, and sitting down or standing,
with their backs to the fences, till we had passed.</p><p>At several of the cross-roads, or at the meeting of two or more roads, were generally <emph rend="italic">Afiatoucas</emph>, such as already described; with this difference, the mounts were
pallisadoed round, instead of a stone wall. At length, after walking several miles, we came to one
larger than common; near to which was a large house belonging to an old chief, in our company. At
this house we were desired to stop, which we accordingly did, and were treated with fruit,
&amp;c.</p><p>We were no sooner seated in the house, than the eldest of the priests began a speech or prayer,
which was first directed to the <emph rend="italic">Afiatouca</emph>, and then to me, and
alternately. When he addressed me, he paused at every sentence, till I gave a nod of approbation. I,
however, did not understand one single word he said. At times, the old gentleman seemed to be at a
loss what to say, or perhaps his memory failed him; for, every now and then, he was prompted by one
of the other priests who sat by him. Both during this prayer and the former one, the people were
silent, but not attentive. At this last place we made but a short stay. Our guides conducted us down
to our boat, and we returned with Attago to our ship to dinner. We had no sooner got on board, than
an old gentleman came alongside, who, I understood from Attago, was some king or great man. He was,
accordingly, ushered on board; when I presented him with such things as he most valued (being the
only method to make him my friend,) and seated him at table to dinner. We now saw that he was a man
of consequence; for Attago would not sit down and eat before him, but got to the other end of the
table; and, as the old chief was almost blind, he sat there, and eat with his back towards him.
After the old man had eaten a bit of fish, and drank two glasses of wine, he returned ashore. As
soon as Attago had seen him out of the ship, he came and took his place at table, finished his
dinner, and drank two glasses of wine. When dinner was over, we all went ashore, where we found the
old chief, who presented me with a hog; and he and some others took a walk with us into the
country.</p><p>Before we set out, I happened to go down with Attago to the landing-place, and there found Mr
Wales in a laughable, though distressed situation. The boats which brought us on shore, not being
able to get near the landing- place for want of a sufficient depth of water, he pulled off his shoes
and stockings to walk through, and as soon as he got on dry land, he put them down betwixt his legs
to put on again, but they were instantly snatched away by a person behind him, who immediately mixed
with the crowd. It was impossible for him to follow the man barefooted over the sharp coral rocks,
which compose the shore, without having his feet cut to pieces. The boat was put back to the ship,
his companions had each made his way through the crowd, and he left in this condition alone. Attago
soon found out the thief, recovered his shoes and stockings, and set him at liberty. Our route into
the country, was by the first-mentioned <emph rend="italic">Afiatouca</emph>, before which we again
seated ourselves, but had no prayers, although the old priest was with us. Our stay here was but
short. The old chief, probably thinking that we might want water on board, conducted us to a
plantation hard by, and shewed us a pool of fresh water, though we had not made the least enquiry
after any. I believe this to be the same that Tasman calls the <emph rend="italic">washing-
place</emph> for the king and his nobles.</p><p>From hence we were conducted down to the shore of Maria Bay, or north-east side of the isle;
where, in a boat-house, was shewn to us a fine large double canoe not yet launched. The old chief
did not fail to make us sensible it belonged to himself. Night now approaching, we took leave of
him, and returned on board, being conducted by Attago down to the water- side.</p><p>Mr Forster and his party spent the day in the country botanizing; and several of the officers
were out shooting. All of them were very civilly treated by the natives. We had also a brisk trade
for bananoes, cocoa-nuts, yams, pigs, and fowls; all of which were procured for nails, and pieces of
cloth. A boat from each ship was employed in trading ashore, and bringing off their cargoes as soon
as they were laden, which was generally in a short time. By this method we got cheaper, and with
less trouble, a good quantity of fruit, as well as other refreshments, from people who had no canoes
to carry them off to the ships.</p><p>Pretty early in the morning on the 5th, my friend brought me a hog and some fruit; for which I
gave him a hatchet, a sheet, and some red cloth. The pinnace was sent ashore to trade as usual, but
soon returned. The officer informed me that the natives were for taking every thing out of the boat,
and, in other respects, were very troublesome. The day before, they stole the grapling at the time
the boat was riding by it, and carried it off undiscovered. I now judged it necessary to have a
guard on shore, to protect the boats and people whose business required their being there; and
accordingly sent the marines, under the command of Lieutenant Edgcumbe. Soon after I went myself,
with my friend Attago, Captain Furneaux, and several of the gentlemen. At landing, we found the
chief, who presented me with a pig. After this, Captain Furneaux and I took a walk into the country,
with Mr Hodges, to make drawings of such places and things as were most interesting. When this was
done, we returned on board to dinner, with my friend and two other chiefs; one of which sent a hog
on board the Adventure for Captain Furneaux, some hours before, without stipulating for any return.
The only instance of this kind. My friend took care to put me in mind of the pig the old king gave
me in the morning; for which I now gave a chequed shirt and a piece of red cloth. I had tied them up
for him to carry ashore; but with this he was not satisfied. He wanted to have them put on him,
which was no sooner done, than he went on deck, and shewed himself to all his countrymen. He had
done the same thing in the morning with the sheet I gave him. In the evening we all went on shore
again, where we found the old king, who took to himself every thing my friend and the others had
got.</p><p>The different trading parties were so successful to-day as to procure for both ships a tolerably
good supply of refreshments. In consequence of which, I, the next morning, gave every one leave to
purchase what curiosities and other things they pleased. After this, it was astonishing to see with
what eagerness every one caught at every thing he saw. It even went so far as to become the ridicule
of the natives, who offered pieces of sticks and stones to exchange. One waggish boy took a piece of
human excrement on the end of a stick, and held it out to every one he met with.</p><p>This day, a man got into the master's cabin, through the outside scuttle, and took out some books
and other things. He was discovered just as he was getting out into his canoe, and pursued by one of
our boats, which obliged him to quit the canoe and take to the water. The people in the boat made
several attempts to lay hold of him; but he as often dived under the boat, and at last having
unshipped the rudder, which rendered her ungovernable, by this means he got clear off. Some other
very daring thefts were committed at the landing-place. One fellow took a seaman's jacket out of the
boat, and carried it off, in spite of all that our people in her could do. Till he was both pursued
and fired at by them, he would not part with it; nor would he have done it then, had not his landing
been intercepted by some of us who were on shore. The rest of the natives, who were very numerous,
took very little notice of the whole transaction; nor were they the least alarmed when the man was
fired at.</p><p>My friend Attago having visited me again next morning, as usual, brought with him a hog, and
assisted me in purchasing several more. Afterwards we went ashore; visited the old king, with whom
we staid till <time>noon</time>, then returned on board to dinner, with Attago, who never once left me. Intending
to sail next morning, I made up a present for the old king, and carried it on shore in the evening.
As soon as I landed, I was told by the officers who were on shore, that a far greater man than any
we had yet seen was come to pay us a visit. Mr Pickersgill informed me that he had seen him in the
country, and found that he was a man of some consequence, by the extraordinary respect paid him by
the people. Some, when they approached him, fell on their faces, and put their head between their
feet; and no one durst pass him without permission. Mr Pickersgill, and another of the gentlemen,
took hold of his arms, and conducted him down to the landing- place, where I found him seated with
so much sullen and stupid gravity, that notwithstanding what had been told me, I really took him for
an idiot, whom the people, from some superstitious notions, were ready to worship. I saluted and
spoke to him; but he neither answered, nor took the least notice of me; nor did he alter a single
feature in his countenance. This confirmed me in my opinion, and I was just going to leave him, when
one of the natives, an intelligent youth, undertook to undeceive me; which he did in such a manner
as left me no room to doubt that he was the king, or principal man on the island. Accordingly I made
him the present I intended for the old chief, which consisted of a shirt, an axe, a piece of red
cloth, a looking-glass, some nails, medals, and beads. He received these things, or rather suffered
them to be put upon him, and laid down by him, without losing a bit of his gravity, speaking one
word, or turning his head either to the right or left; sitting the whole time like a statue; in
which situation I left him to return on board, and he soon after retired. I had not been long on
board before word was brought me, that a quantity of provisions had come from this chief. A boat was
sent to bring it from the shore; and it consisted of about twenty baskets of roasted bananoes, sour
bread, and yams, and a roasted pig of about twenty pounds weight. Mr Edgcumbe and his party were
just re-embarking, when these were brought to the water-side, and the bearers said it was a present
from the <emph rend="italic">Areeke</emph>, that is, the king of the island, to the <emph rend="italic">Areeke</emph> of the ship. After this I was no longer to doubt the dignity of this
sullen chief.</p><p>Early in the morning of the 7th, while the ships were unmooring, I went ashore with Captain
Furneaux and Mr Forster, in order to make some return to the king, for his last night's present. We
no sooner landed than we found Attago, of whom we enquired for the king, whose name was Kohaghee-
too-Fallangou. He accordingly undertook to conduct us to him; but, whether he mistook the man we
wanted, or was ignorant where he was, I know not. Certain it is, that he took us a wrong road, in
which he had not gone far before he stopped, and after some little conversation between him and
another man, we returned back, and presently after the king appeared, with very few attendants. As
soon as Attago saw him coming, he sat down under a tree, and desired us to do the same. The king
seated himself on a rising ground, about twelve or fifteen yards from us: Here we sat facing one
another for some minutes. I waited for Attago to shew us the way; but seeing he did not rise,
Captain Furneaux and I got up, went and saluted the king, and sat down by him. We then presented him
with a white shirt, (which we put on his back) a few yards of red cloth, a brass kettle, a saw, two
large spikes, three looking-glasses, a dozen of medals, and some strings of beads. All this time he
sat with the same sullen stupid gravity as the day before; he even did not seem to see or know what
we were about; his arms appeared immoveable at his sides; he did not so much as raise them when we
put on the shirt. I told him, both by words and signs, that we were going to leave his island; he
scarcely made the least answer to this, or any other thing we either said or did. We, therefore, got
up and took leave; but I yet remained near him, to observe his actions. Soon after, he entered into
conversation with Attago and an old woman, whom we took to be his mother. I did not understand any
part of the conversation; it however made him laugh, in spite of his assumed gravity. I say assumed,
because it exceeded every thing of the kind I ever saw; and therefore think it could not be his real
disposition, unless he was an idiot indeed, as these islanders, like all the others we had lately
visited, have a great deal of levity, and he was in the prime of life. At last he rose up, and
retired with his mother and two or three more.</p><p>Attago conducted us to another circle, where were seated the aged chief and several respectable
old persons of both sexes; among whom was the priest, who was generally in company with this chief.
We observed, that this reverend father could walk very well in a morning, but in the evening was
obliged to be led home by two people. By this we concluded, that the juice of the pepper-root had
the same effect upon him, that wine and other strong liquors have on Europeans who drink a large
portion of them. It is very certain, that these old people seldom sat down without preparing a bowl
of this liquor, which is done in the same manner as at Ulietea. We however must do them the justice
to believe, that it was meant to treat us; nevertheless, the greatest part, if not the whole,
generally fell to their share. I was not well prepared to take leave of this chief, having exhausted
almost all our store on the other. However, after rummaging our pockets, and treasury-bag, which was
always carried with me wherever I went, we made up a tolerable present, both for him and his
friends. This old chief had an air of dignity about him that commanded respect, which the other had
not. He was grave, but not sullen; would crack a joke, talk on indifferent subjects, and endeavour
to understand us and be understood himself. During this visit, the old priest repeated a short
prayer or speech, the purport of which we did not understand. Indeed he would frequently, at other
times, break out in prayer; but I never saw any attention paid to him by any one present. After a
stay of near two hours, we took leave, and returned on board, with Attago and two or three more
friends, who staid and breakfasted with us; after which they were dismissed, loaded with
presents.</p><p>Attago was very importunate with me to return again to this isle, and to bring with me cloth,
axes, nails, &amp;c. &amp;c. telling me that I should have hogs, fowls, fruit, and roots, in
abundance. He particularly desired me, more than once, to bring him such a suit of clothes as I had
on, which was my uniform. This good-natured islander was very serviceable to me, on many occasions,
during our short stay. He constantly came on board every morning soon after it was light, and never
quitted us till the evening. He was always ready, either on board or on shore, to do me all the
service in his power: His fidelity was rewarded at a small expence, and I found my account in having
such a friend.</p><p>In heaving in the coasting cable, it parted in the middle of its length, being chafed by the
rocks. By this accident we lost the other half, together with the anchor, which lay in forty fathoms
water, without any buoy to it. The best bower-cable suffered also by the rocks; by which a judgment
may be formed of this anchorage. At <time>ten o'clock</time> we got under sail; but as our decks were much
encumbered with fruit, &amp;c. we kept plying under the land till they were cleared. The supplies we
got at this isle, were about one hundred and fifty pigs, twice that number of fowls, as many
bananoes and cocoa-nuts as we could find room for, with a few yams; and had our stay been longer, we
no doubt might have got a great deal more. This in some degree shews the fertility of the island, of
which, together with the neighbouring one of Middleburg, I shall now give a more particular
account.</p></div><div type="chapter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N"><head><l>CHAPTER III.</l><l><emph rend="italic">A Description of the Islands and their Produce; with the Cultivation, Houses,
Canoes, Navigation, Manufactures, Weapons, Customs, Government, Religion, and Language of the
Inhabitants.</emph></l></head><p><date>1773 October</date></p><p>These islands were first discovered by Captain Tasman, in <date>January, 1642-3</date>, and by him called
Amsterdam and Middleburg. But the former is called by the natives Ton-ga-ta-bu, and the latter
Ea-oo-wee. They are situated between the latitude of <geo select="lat">21° 29' S</geo>  and <geo select="lat" n="1">21° 3' S</geo>outh, and between the
longitude of <geo select="lon">174° 40' W</geo>and <geo select="lon" n="1">175° 15' W</geo>est, deduced from observations made on the spot.</p><p>Middleburg, or Eaoowee, which is the southernmost, is about ten leagues in circuit, and of a
height sufficient to be seen twelve leagues. The skirts of this isle are mostly taken up in the
plantations; the S.W. and N.W. sides especially. The interior parts are but little cultivated,
though very fit for cultivation. However, the want of it added greatly to the beauty of the isle;
for here are, agreeably dispersed, groves of cocoa-nut and other trees, lawns covered with thick
grass, here and there plantations, and paths leading to every part of the island, in such beautiful
disorder, as greatly enlivens the prospect.</p><p>The anchorage, which I named English Road, being the first who anchored there, is on the N.W.
side, in latitude <geo select="lat">21° 20' 30" S</geo>outh. The bank is a coarse sand; it extends two miles from the land,
and on it there is from twenty to forty fathoms water. The small creek before it affords convenient
landing for boats at all times of the tide; which here, as well as at the other islands, rises about
four or five feet, and is high water on the full and change days about <time>seven o'clock</time>. The island of
Tongatabu is shaped something like an isosceles triangle, the longest sides whereof are seven
leagues each, and the shortest four. It lies nearly in the direction of E.S.E. and W.N.W.; is nearly
all of an equal height, rather low, not exceeding sixty or eighty feet above the level of the sea.
This island, and also that of Eaoowee, is guarded from the sea by a reef of coral rocks, extending
out from the shore one hundred fathoms more or less. On this reef the force of the sea is spent
before it reaches the land or shore. Indeed, this is in some measure the situation of all the
tropical isles in this sea that I have seen; and thus nature has effectually secured them from the
encroachments of the sea, though many of them are mere points when compared to this vast ocean. Van
Diemen's Road, where we anchored, is under the northwest part of the island, between the most
northern and western points. There lies a reef of rocks without it, bearing N.W. by W., over which
the sea breaks continually. The bank does not extend more than three cables length from the shore;
without that, is an unfathomable depth. The loss of an anchor, and the damage our cables sustained,
are sufficient proofs that the bottom is none of the best.</p><p>On the east side of the north point of the island, (as Mr Gilbert, whom I sent to survey the
parts, informed me) is a very snug harbour, of one mile or more in extent, wherein is seven, eight,
and ten fathoms water, with a clean sandy bottom. The channel, by which he went in and out, lies
close to the point, and has only three fathoms water; but he believes, that farther to the N.E. is a
channel with a much greater depth, which he had not time to examine. Indeed, it would have taken up
far more time than I could spare to have surveyed these parts minutely; as there lies a number of
small islets and reefs of rocks along the N.E. side of the island, which seemed to extend to the
N.E. farther than the eye could reach. The island of Amsterdam, or Tongatabu, is wholly laid out in
plantations, in which are planted some of the richest productions of nature, such as bread-fruit,
cocoa-nut trees, plantains, bananoes, shaddocks, yams, and some other roots, sugar-cane, and a fruit
like a nectarine, called by them <emph rend="italic">Fighegea</emph>, and at Otaheite <emph rend="italic">Ahuya</emph>: In short, here are most of the articles which the Society Islands
produce, besides some which they have not. Mr Forster tells me, that he not only found the same
plants here that are at Otaheite and the neighbouring isles, but several others which are not to be
met with there. And I probably have added to their stock of vegetables, by leaving with them an
assortment of garden seeds, pulse, &amp;c. Bread-fruit here, as well as at all the other isles, was
not in season; nor was this the time for roots and shaddocks. We got the latter only at
Middleburg.</p><p>The produce and cultivation of this isle is the same as at Amsterdam; with this difference, that
a part only of the former is cultivated, whereas the whole of the latter is. The lanes or roads
necessary for travelling, are laid out in so judicious a manner, as to open a free and easy
communication from one part of the island to the other. Here are no towns or villages; most of the
houses are built in the plantations, with no other order than what conveniency requires; they are
neatly constructed, but do not exceed those in the other isles. The materials of which they are
built are the same; and some little variation in the disposition of the framing, is all the
difference in their construction. The floor is a little raised, and covered with thick strong mats;
the same sort of matting serves to inclose them on the windward side, the other being open. They
have little areas before the most of them, which are generally planted round with trees, or shrubs
of ornament, whose fragrancy perfumes the very air in which they breathe. Their household furniture
consists of a few wooden platters, cocoa-nut shells, and some neat wooden pillows shaped like
four-footed stools or forms. Their common clothing, with the addition of a mat, serves them for
bedding. We got from them two or three earthen vessels, which were all we saw among them. One was in
the shape of a bomb-shell, with two boles in it, opposite each other; the others were like pipkins,
containing about five or six pints, and had been in use on the fire. I am of opinion they are the
manufacture of some other isle; for, if they were of their own, we ought to have seen more of them.
Nor am I to suppose they came from Tasman's ships; the time is too long for brittle vessels like
these to be preserved.</p><p>We saw no other domestic animals amongst them but hogs and fowls. The former are of the same sort
as at the other isles in this sea; but the latter are far superior, being as large as any we have in
Europe, and their flesh equally good, if not better. We saw no dogs, and believe they have none, as
they were exceedingly desirous of those we had on board. My friend Attago was complimented with a
dog and a bitch, the one from New Zealand, the other from Ulietea. The name of a dog with them is
<emph rend="italic">kooree</emph> or <emph rend="italic">gooree</emph>, the same as at New Zealand,
which shews that they are not wholly strangers to them. We saw no rats in these isles, nor any other
wild quadrupeds, except small lizards. The land birds are pigeons, turtle-doves, parrots,
parroquets, owls, bald couts with a blue plumage, a variety of small birds, and large bats in
abundance. The produce of the sea we know but little of; it is reasonable to suppose, that the same
sorts of fish are found here as at the other isles. Their fishing instruments are the same; that is,
hooks made of mother-of-pearl, gigs with two, three, or more prongs, and nets made of a very fine
thread, with the meshes wrought exactly like ours. But nothing can be a more demonstrative evidence
of their ingenuity than the construction and make of their canoes, which, in point of neatness and
workmanship, exceed every thing of this kind we saw in this sea. They are built of several pieces
sewed together with bandage, in so neat a manner, that on the outside it is difficult to see the
joints. All the fastenings are on the inside, and pass through kants or ridges, which are wrought on
the edges and ends of the several boards which compose the vessel, for that purpose. They are of two
kinds, viz. double and single. The single ones are from twenty to thirty feet long, and about twenty
or twenty-two inches broad in the middle; the stern terminates in a point, and the head something
like the point of a wedge. At each end is a kind of deck, for about one-third part of the whole
length, and open in the middle. In some the middle of the deck is decorated with a row of white
shells, stuck on little pegs wrought out of the same piece which composes it. These single canoes
have all out-riggers, and are sometimes navigated with sails, but more generally with paddles, the
blades of which are short, and broadest in the middle. The two vessels which compose the double
canoe are each about sixty or seventy feet long, and four or five broad in the middle, and each end
terminates nearly in a point; so that the body or hull differs a little in construction from the
single canoe, but is put together exactly in the same manner; these having a rising in the middle
round the open part, in the form of a long trough, which is made of boards, closely fitted together,
and well secured to the body of the vessel. Two such vessels are fastened to, and parallel to each
other, about six or seven feet asunder, by strong cross beams, secured by bandages to the upper part
of the risings above mentioned. Over these beams, and others which are supported by stanchions fixed
on the bodies of the canoes, is laid a boarded platform. All the parts which compose the double
canoe, are made as strong and light as the nature of the work will admit, and may be immerged in
water to the very platform, without being in danger of filling. Nor is it possible, under any
circumstance whatever, for them to sink, so long as they hold together. Thus they are not only
vessels of burden, but fit for distant navigation. They are rigged with one mast, which steps upon
the platform, and can easily be raised or taken down; and are sailed with a latteen-sail, or
triangular one, extended by a long yard, which is a little bent or crooked. The sail is made of
mats; the rope they make use of is exactly like ours, and some of it is four or five inch. On the
platform is built a little shed or hut, which screens the crew from the sun and weather, and serves
for other purposes. They also carry a moveable fire- hearth, which is a square, but shallow trough
of wood, filled with stones. The way into the hold of the canoe is from off the platform, down a
sort of uncovered hatchway, in which they stand to bale out the water. I think these vessels are
navigated either end foremost, and that, in changing tacks, they have only occasion to shift or jib
round the sail; but of this I was not certain, as I had not then seen any under sail, or with the
mast and sail an end, but what were a considerable distance from us.</p><p>Their working tools are made of stone, bone, shells, &amp;c. as at the other islands. When we
view the work which is performed with these tools, we are struck with admiration at the ingenuity
and patience of the workman. Their knowledge of the utility of iron was no more than sufficient to
teach them to prefer nails to beads, and such trifles; some, but very few, would exchange a pig for
a large nail, or a hatchet. Old jackets, shirts, cloth, and even rags, were in more esteem than the
best edge-tool we could give them; consequently they got but few axes from us but what were given as
presents. But if we include the nails which were given by the officers and crews of both ships for
curiosities, &amp;c. with those given for refreshments, they cannot have got less than five hundred
weight, great and small. The only piece of iron we saw among them was a small broad awl, which had
been made of a nail.</p><p>Both men and women are of a common size with Europeans; and their colour is that of a lightish
copper, and more uniformly so than amongst the inhabitants of Otaheite and the Society Isles. Some
of our gentlemen were of opinion these were a much handsomer race; others maintained a contrary
opinion, of which number I was one. Be this as it may, they have a good shape, and regular features,
and are active, brisk, and lively. The women, in particular, are the merriest creatures I ever met
with, and will keep chattering by one's side, without the least invitation, or considering whether
they are understood, provided one does but seem pleased with them. In general they appeared to be
modest; although there was no want of those of a different stamp; and as we had yet some venereal
complaints on board, I took all possible care to prevent the disorder being communicated to them. On
most occasions they shewed a strong propensity to pilfering; in which they were full as expert as
the Otaheitans.</p><p>Their hair in general is black, but more especially that of the women. Different colours were
found among the men, sometimes on the same head, caused by something they put upon it, which stains
it white, red, and blue. Both sexes wear it short; I saw but two exceptions to this custom, and the
most of them combed it upwards. Many of the boys had it cut very close, except a single lock on the
top of the head, and a small quantity on each side. The men cut or shave their beards quite close,
which operation is performed with two shells. They have fine eyes, and in general good teeth, even
to an advanced age. The custom of <emph rend="italic">tattowing</emph> or puncturing the skin
prevails. The men are <emph rend="italic">tattowed</emph> from the middle of the thigh to above the
hips. The women have it only on their arms and fingers; and there but very slightly.</p><p>The dress of both sexes consists of a piece of cloth or matting wrapped round the waist, and
hanging down below the knees. From the waist, upwards, they are generally naked; and it seemed to be
a custom to anoint these parts every morning. My friend Attago never failed to do it; but whether
out of respect to his friend, or from custom, I will not pretend to say; though I rather think from
the latter, as he was not singular in the practice.</p><p>Their ornaments are amulets, necklaces, and bracelets of bones, shells, and beads of
mother-of-pearl, tortoise-shell, &amp;c. which are worn by both sexes. The women also wear on their
fingers neat rings made of tortoise-shell, and pieces in their ears about the size of a small quill;
but ear ornaments are not commonly worn, though all have their ears pierced. They have also a
curious apron made of the outside fibres of the cocoa-nut shell, and composed of a number of small
pieces sewed together in such a manner as to form stars, half-moons, little squares, &amp;c. It is
studded with beads of shells, and covered with red feathers, so as to have a pleasing effect. They
make the same kind of cloth, and of the same materials, as at Otaheite; though they have not such a
variety, nor do they make any so fine; but, as they have a method of glazing it, it is more durable,
and will resist rain for some time, which Otaheite cloth will not. Their colours are black, brown,
purple, yellow, and red; all made from vegetables. They make various sorts of matting; some of a
very fine texture, which is generally used for clothing; and the thick and stronger sort serves to
sleep on, and to make sails for their canoes, &amp;c. Among other useful utensils, they have various
sorts of baskets; some are made of the same materials as their mats; and others of the twisted
fibres of cocoa-nuts. These are not only durable but beautiful; being generally composed of
different colours, and studded with beads made of shells or bones. They have many little nick-nacks
amongst them; which shews that they neither want taste to design, nor skill to execute, whatever
they take in hand.</p><p>How these people amuse themselves in their leisure hours, I cannot say, as we are but little
acquainted with their diversions. The women frequently entertained us with songs, in a manner which
was agreeable enough. They accompany the music by snapping their fingers, so as to keep time to it.
Not only their voices, but their music was very harmonious, and they have a considerable compass in
their notes. I saw but two musical instruments amongst them. One was a large flute made of a piece
of bamboo, which they fill with their noses as at Otaheite; but these have four holes or stops,
whereas those of Otaheite have only two. The other was composed of ten or eleven small reeds of
unequal lengths, bound together side by side, as the Doric pipe of the ancients is said to have
been; and the open ends of the reeds into which they blow with their mouths, are of equal height, or
in a line. They have also a drum, which, without any impropriety, may be compared to an hollow log
of wood. The one I saw was five feet six inches long, and thirty inches in girt, and had a slit in
it, from the one end to the other, about three inches wide, by means of which it had been hollowed
out. They beat on the side of this log with two drum-sticks, and produce an hollow sound, not quite
so musical as that of an empty cask.</p><p>The common method of saluting one another is by touching or meeting noses, as is done in New
Zealand, and their sign of peace to strangers, is the displaying a white flag or flags; at least
such were displayed to us, when we first drew near the shore. But the people who came first on board
brought with them some of the pepper plant, and sent it before them into the ship; a stronger sign
of friendship than which one could not wish for. From their unsuspicious manner of coming on board,
and of receiving us at first on shore, I am of opinion, they are seldom disturbed by either foreign
or domestic troubles. They are, however, not unprovided with very formidable weapons; such as clubs
and spears, made of hard wood, also bows and arrows. The clubs are from three to five feet in
length, and of various shapes. Their bows and arrows are but indifferent; the former being very
slight, and the latter only made of a slender reed, pointed with hard wood. Some of their spears
have many barbs, and must be very dangerous weapons where they take effect. On the inside of the bow
is a groove, in which is put the arrow; from which it would seem that they use but one.</p><p>They have a singular custom of putting every thing you give them to their heads, by way of
thanks, as we conjectured. This manner of paying a compliment, is taught them from their very
infancy; for when we gave things to little children, the mother lifted up the child's hand to its
head. They also used this custom in their exchanges with us; whatever we gave them for their goods,
was always applied to the head, just as if it had been given them for nothing. Sometimes they would
look at our goods, and if not approved, return them back; but whenever they applied them to the
head, the bargain was infallibly struck. When I had made a present to the chief of any thing
curious, I frequently saw it handed from one to another; and every one, into whose hands it came,
put it to the head. Very often the women would take hold of my hand, kiss it, and lift it to their
heads. From all this it should seem, that this custom, which they call <emph rend="italic">fagafatie</emph>, has various significations according as it is applied; all, however,
complimentary.</p><p>It must be observed, that the sullen chief or king did not pay me any of these compliments for
the presents I made him.</p><p>A still more singular custom prevails in these isles: We observed that the greater part of the
people, both men and women, had lost one, or both their little fingers. We endeavoured, but in vain,
to find out the reason of this mutilation; for no one would take any pains to inform us. It was
neither peculiar to rank, age, or sex; nor is it done at any certain age, as I saw those of all ages
on whom the amputation had been just made; and, except some young children, we found few who had
both hands perfect. As it was more common among the aged than the young, some of us were of opinion
that it was occasioned by the death of their parents, or some other near relation. But Mr Wales one
day met with a man, whose hands were both perfect, of such an advanced age, that it was hardly
possible his parents could be living. They also burn or make incisions in their cheeks, near the
cheek-bone. The reason of this was equally unknown to us. In some, the wounds were quite fresh; in
others, they could only be known by the scars, or colour of the skin. I saw neither sick nor lame
amongst them; all appeared healthy, strong, and vigorous; a proof of the goodness of the climate in
which they live.</p><p>I have frequently mentioned a king, which implies the government being in a single person,
without knowing for certain whether it is so or no. Such an one was however pointed out to us; and
we had no reason to doubt it. From this, and other circumstances, I am of opinion that the
government is much like that of Otaheite: That is, in a king or great chief, who is here called
Areeke, with other chiefs under him, who are lords of certain districts, and perhaps sole
proprietors, to whom the people seem to pay great obedience. I also observed a third rank, who had
not a little authority over the common people; my friend Attago was one of these. I am of opinion
that all the land on. <emph rend="italic">Tongatabu</emph> is private property, and that there are
here, as at Otaheite, a set of people, who are servants or slaves, and have no property in land. It
is unreasonable to suppose every thing in common in a country so highly cultivated as this. Interest
being the greatest spring which animates the hand of industry, few would toil in cultivating and
planting the land, if they did not expect to reap the fruit of their labour: Were it otherwise, the
industrious man would be in a worse state than the idle sluggard. I frequently saw parties of six,
eight, or ten people, bring down to the landing place fruit and other things to dispose of, where
one person, a man or woman, superintended the sale of the whole; no exchanges were made but with his
or her consent; and whatever we gave in exchange was always given them, which I think plainly shewed
them to be the owners of the goods, and the others no more than servants. Though benevolent nature
has been very bountiful to these isles, it cannot be said that the inhabitants are wholly exempt
from the curse of our forefathers: Part of their bread must be earned by the sweat of their brows.
The high state of cultivation their lands are in, must have cost them immense labour. This is now
amply rewarded by the great produce, of which every one seems to partake. No one wants the common
necessaries of life; joy and contentment are painted in every face. Indeed, it can hardly be
otherwise; an easy freedom prevails among all ranks of people; they feel no wants which they do not
enjoy the means of gratifying; and they live in a clime where the painful extremes of heat and cold
are equally unknown. If nature has been wanting in any thing, it is in the article of fresh water,
which as it is shut up in the bowels of the earth, they are obliged to dig for. A running stream was
not seen, and but one well, at Amsterdam. At Middleburg, we saw no water but what the natives had in
vessels; but as it was sweet and cool, I had no doubt of its being taken up upon the island; and
probably not far from the spot where I saw it.</p><p>So little do we know of their religion, that I hardly dare mention it. The buildings called <emph rend="italic">Afiatoucas</emph>, before mentioned, are undoubtedly set apart for this purpose. Some
of our gentlemen were of opinion, that they were merely burying-places. I can only say, from my own
knowledge, that they are places to which particular persons directed set speeches, which I
understood to be prayers, as hath been already related. Joining my opinion with that of others, I
was inclined to think that they are set apart to be both temples and burying-places, as at Otaheite,
or even in Europe. But I have no idea of the images being idols; not only from what I saw myself,
but from Mr Wales's informing me that they set one of them up, for him and others to shoot at.</p><p>One circumstance shewed that these <emph rend="italic">Afiatoucas</emph> were frequently resorted
to, for one purpose or other—the areas, or open places, before them, being covered with a green sod,
the grass on which was very short. This did not appear to have been cut, or reduced by the hand of
man, but to have been prevented in its growth, by being often trod, or sat upon.</p><p>It cannot be supposed that we could know much, either of their civil or religious policy, in so
short a time as four or five days, especially as we understood but little of their language: Even
the two islanders we had on board could not at first understand them, and yet as we became the more
acquainted with them, we found their language was nearly the same spoken at Otaheite and the Society
Isles. The difference not being greater than what we find betwixt the most northern and western
parts of England, as will more fully appear by the vocabulary.</p></div><div type="chapter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N"><head><l>CHAPTER IV.</l><l><emph rend="italic">Passage from Amsterdam to Queen Charlotte's Sound, with an Account of an
Interview with the Inhabitants, and the final Separation of the two Ships.</emph></l></head><p><date>1773 October</date></p><p>About the time we were in a condition to make sail, a canoe, conducted by four men, came
along-side, with one of those drums already mentioned, on which one man kept continually beating;
thinking, no doubt, the music would charm us. I gave them a piece of cloth and a nail, for the drum;
and took an opportunity to send to my friend Attago some wheat, pease, and beans, which I had forgot
to give him when he had the other seeds. As soon as this canoe was gone, we made sail to the
southward, having a gentle gale at S.E. by E.; it being my intention to proceed directly to Queen
Charlotte's Sound in New Zealand, there to take in wood and water, and then to go on farther
discoveries to the south and east.</p><p>In the <time>afternoon</time> on the 8th, we made the island of Pilstart, bearing S.W. by W. 1/2 W., distant
seven or eight leagues. This island, which was also discovered by Tasman, is situated in the
latitude of <geo select="lat">22° 26' S</geo>outh, longitude <geo select="lon">175° 59' W</geo>est, and lies in the direction of S. 52° west,
distant thirty-two leagues from the south end of Middleburg. It is more conspicuous in height than
circuit; having in it two considerable hills, seemingly disjoined from each other by a low valley.
After a few hours calm the wind came to S.W.; with which we stretched to the S.E.; but on the 10th,
it veered round by the south to the S.E. and E.S.E. and then we resumed our course to the S.S.W.</p><p>At <time>five o'clock  in the morning</time> of the 21st, we made the land of New Zealand, extending from N.W.
by N. to W.S.W.; at <time>noon</time>, Table Cape bore west, distant eight or ten leagues. I was very desirous of
having some intercourse with the natives of this country as far to the north as possible; that is,
about Poverty or Tolaga Bays, where I apprehended they were more civilized than at Queen Charlotte's
Sound; in order to give them some hogs, fowls, seeds, roots, &amp;c. which I had provided for the
purpose. The wind veering to the N.W. and north, enabled us to fetch in with the land a little to
the north of Portland, and we stood as near the shore as we could with safety. We observed several
people upon it, but none attempted to come off to us. Seeing this, we bore away under Portland,
where we lay-to some time, as well to give time for the natives to come off, as to wait for the
Adventure. There were several people on Portland, but none seemed inclined to come to us; indeed the
wind, at this time, blew rather too fresh for them to make the attempt. Therefore, as soon as the
Adventure was up with us, we made sail for Cape Kidnappers, which we passed at <time>five o'clock</time> in the
morning, and continued our course along-shore till nine, when, being about three leagues short off
Black-head, we saw some canoes put off from the shore. Upon this I brought to, in order to give them
time to come on board; but ordered the Adventure, by signal, to stand on, as I was willing to lose
as little time as possible.</p><p>Those in the first canoe, which came along-side, were fishers, and exchanged some fish for pieces
of cloth and nails. In the next, were two men, whom, by their dress and behaviour, I took to be
chiefs.—These two were easily prevailed on to come on board, when they were presented with nails and
other articles. They were so fond of nails, as to seize on all they could find, and with such
eagerness, as plainly shewed they were the most valuable things we could give them. To the principal
of these two men I gave the pigs, fowls, seeds, and roots. I believe, at first, he did not think I
meant to give them to him; for he took but little notice of them, till he was satisfied they were
for himself. Nor was he then in such a rapture as when I gave him a spike-nail half the length of
his arm. However, at his going away I took notice, that he very well remembered how many pigs and
fowls had been given him, as he took care to have them all collected together, and kept a watchful
eye over them, lest any should be taken away. He made me a promise not to kill any; and if he keeps
his word, and proper care is taken of them, there were enough to stock the whole island in due time;
being two boars, two sows, four hens, and two cocks; The seeds were such as are most useful (viz.)
wheat, French and kidney beans, pease, cabbage, turnips, onions, carrots, parsnips, and yams,
&amp;c. With these articles they were dismissed. It was evident these people had not forgot the
Endeavour being on their coast; for the first words they spoke to us were, <emph rend="italic">Mataou no te pow pow</emph> (we are afraid of the guns). As they could be no strangers to the
affair which happened off Cape Kidnappers in my former voyage, experience had taught them to have
some regard to these instruments of death.</p><p>As soon as they were gone, we stretched off to the southward, the wind having now veered to the
W.S.W. In the <time>afternoon</time> it increased to a fresh gale, and blew in squalls; in one of which we lost
our fore-top-gallant mast, having carried the sail a little too long. The fear of losing the land
induced me to carry as much sail as possible. At seven in the morning, we tacked and stretched in
shore, Cape Turnagain at this time bore about N.W. 1/2 N. distant six or seven leagues. The
Adventure, being a good way to leeward, we supposed, did not observe the signal, but stood on;
consequently was separated from us. During the night (which was spent in plying) the wind increased
in such a manner as to bring us under our courses; it also veered to S.W. and S.S.W., and was
attended with rain.</p><p>At nine in the morning on the 23d, the sky began to clear up, and the gale to abate, so that we
could carry close-reefed top-sails. At <time>eleven o'clock</time> we were close in with Cape Turnagain, when we
tacked and stood off; at <time>noon</time> the said Cape bore west a little northerly, distant six or seven
miles. Latitude observed <geo select="lat">41° 30' S</geo>outh. Soon after, the wind falling almost to a calm, and
flattering ourselves that it would be succeeded by one more favourable, we got up another
top-gallant-mast, rigged top-gallant-yards, and loosed all the reefs out of the top-sails. The event
was not equal to our wishes. The wind, indeed, came something more favourable, that is at W. by N.,
with which we stretched along shore to the southward; but it soon increased in such a manner, as to
undo what we had but just done, and at last stripped us to our courses, and two close-reefed
top-sails under which sails we continued all night. About day-light, the next morning, the gale
abating, we were again tempted to loose out the reefs, and rig top-gallant- yards, which proved all
lost labour; for, by <time>nine o'clock</time>, we were reduced to the same sail as before. Soon after, the
Adventure joined us; and at <time>noon</time> Cape Palliser bore west, distant eight or nine leagues. This Cape
is the northern point of Eaheinomauwe. We continued to stretch to the southward till midnight, when
the wind abated and shifted to S.E. Three hours after, it fell calm, during which we loosed the
reefs out, with the vain hopes that the next wind which came would be favourable. We were mistaken;
the wind only took this short repose, in order to gain strength, and fall the heavier upon us. For
at <time>five o'clock  in the morning</time>, being the 25th, a gale sprung up at N.W. with which we stretched to
S.W.; Cape Palliser at this time bore N.N.W., distant eight or nine leagues. The wind increased in
such a manner, as obliged us to take in one reef after another; and, at last, it came on with such
fury, as made it necessary to take in all our sails with the utmost expedition, and to lie-to under
bare poles. The sea rose in proportion with the wind; so that we had a terrible gale and a
mountainous sea to encounter. Thus after beating up against a hard gale for two days, and arriving
just in sight of our port, we had the mortification to be driven off from the land by a furious
storm. Two favourable circumstances attended it, which gave us some consolation; it was fair over
head, and we were not apprehensive of a lee-shore.</p><p>The storm continued all the day without the least intermission. In the evening we bore down to
look for the Adventure, she being out of sight to leeward, and after running the distance we
supposed her to be off, brought to again without seeing her; it being so very hazy and thick in the
horizon, that we could not see a mile round us, occasioned by the spray of the sea being lifted up
to a great height by the force of the wind. At midnight the gale abated; soon after fell little
wind; and at last shifted to S.W., when we wore, set the courses and top-sails close-reefed, and
stood in for the land. Soon after the wind freshened and fixed at south; but as the Adventure was
some distance a-stern, we lay by for her till <time>eight o'clock</time>, when we both made all sail, and steered
N. by W. 1/2 W. for the Strait. At <time>noon</time> observed in <geo select="lat">42° 27' S</geo>outh, Cape Palliser, by judgment, bore
north, distant seventeen leagues. This favourable wind was not of sufficient duration; in the
<time>afternoon</time> it fell by little and little, and at length to a calm; this at <time>ten o'clock</time> was succeeded
by a fresh breeze from the north, with which we stretched to the westward.</p><p>At <time>three o'clock</time> next morning, we were pretty well in with Cape Campbell on the west side of the
Strait, when we tacked, and stretched over for Cape Palliser, under courses and close-reefed
top-sails, having the wind at N.W., a very strong gale and fair weather. At <time>noon</time>, we tacked and
stretched to S.W., with the last-mentioned Cape bearing west, distant four or five leagues. In the
<time>afternoon</time>, the gale increased in such a manner as brought us under our courses. We continued to
stretch to the S.W. till midnight, when we wore, and set close-reefed top-sails.</p><p>On the 28th, at <time>eight o'clock  in the morning</time>, we wore, and stood again to the S.W. till <time>noon</time>,
when we were obliged to lie-to under the fore-sail. At this time the high land over Cape Campbell
bore west, distant ten or twelve leagues. The Adventure four or five miles to leeward. In the
<time>afternoon</time> the fury of the gale began to abate; when we set the main-sail, close-reefed
main-top-sail, and stood to the windward with the wind at W.N.W. and W. by N. a strong gale,
attended with heavy squalls.</p><p>In the morning of the 29th, the wind abated and shifted to S.W. a gentle gale. Of this we took
immediate advantage, set all our sails, and stood for Cape Palliser, which at <time>noon</time> bore W. by N. 1/2
N., distant about six leagues. The wind continued between the S.W. and south till five in the
evening, when it fell calm. At this time we were about three leagues from the Cape. At <time>seven o'clock</time>
the calm was succeeded by a gentle breeze from N.N.E., as fair as we could wish; so that we began to
reckon what time we should reach the Sound the next day; but at nine the wind shifted to its old
quarter N.W., and blew a fresh gale, with which we stretched to the S.W., under single-reefed
topsails and courses, with the Adventure in company. She was seen until midnight, at which time she
was two or three miles a-stern, and presently after she disappeared; nor was she to be seen at
day-light. We supposed she had tacked and stood to the N.E., by which manoeuvre we lost sight of
her.</p><p>We continued to stretch to the westward with the wind at N.N.W., which increased in such a manner
as to bring us under our two courses, after splitting a new main-topsail. At <time>noon</time> Cape Campbell bore
W. by N., distant seven or eight leagues. At three in the <time>afternoon</time> the gale began to abate, and to
veer more to the north, so that we fetched in with the land, under the Snowy Mountains, about four
or five leagues to windward of the Lookers- on, where there was the appearance of a large bay, I now
regretted the loss of the Adventure; for had she been with me, I should have given up all thoughts
of going to Queen Charlotte's Sound to wood and water, and have sought for a place to get these
articles farther south, as the wind was now favourable for ranging along the coast. But our
separation made it necessary for me to repair to the Sound, that being the place of rendezvous.</p><p>As we approached the land, we saw smoke in several places along the shore; a sure sign that the
coast was inhabited. Our soundings were from forty- seven to twenty-five fathoms; that is, at the
distance of three miles from the shore, forty-seven fathoms; and twenty-five fathoms at the distance
of one mile, where we tacked, and stood to the eastward, under the two courses and close-reefed
top-sails; but the latter we could not carry long before we were obliged to hand them. We continued
to stand to the eastward all night, in hopes of meeting with the Adventure in the morning.</p><p>Seeing nothing of her then, we wore and brought to, under the fore-sail and mizen-stay-sail, the
wind having increased to a perfect storm; but we had not been long in this situation before it
abated, so as to permit us to carry the two courses, under which we stood to the west; and at <time>noon</time>
the Snowy Mountains bore W.N.W., distant twelve or fourteen leagues. At <time>six o'clock  in the evening</time>
the wind quite ceased; but this proved only a momentary repose; for presently after it began to blow
with redoubled fury, and obliged us to lie-to under the mizen-stay-sail; in which situation we
continued till midnight, when the storm lessened; and two hours after it fell calm.</p><p><date>1773 November</date></p><p>On the 1st of November, at <time>four o'clock  in the morning</time>, the calm was succeeded by a breeze from
the south. This soon after increased to a fresh gale, attended with hazy, rainy weather, which gave
us hopes that the N.W. winds were done; for it must be observed, that they were attended with clear
and fair weather. We were not wanting in taking immediate advantage of this favourable wind, by
setting all our sails, and steering for Cape Campbell, which at <time>noon</time> bore north, distant three or
four leagues. At <time>two o'clock</time> we passed the Cape, and entered the Strait with a brisk gale a- stern,
and so likely to continue that we thought of nothing less than reaching our port the next morning.
Once more we were to be deceived; at <time>six o'clock</time>, being off Cloudy Bay, our favourable wind was
succeeded by one from the north, which soon after veered to N.W., and increased to a fresh gale. We
spent the night plying; our tacks proved disadvantageous; and we lost more on the ebb than we gained
on the flood. Next morning, we stretched over for the shore of Eaheinomauwe. At sun-rise the horizon
being extraordinarily clear to leeward, we looked well out for the Adventure; but as we saw nothing
of her, judged she had got into the Sound. As we approached the above-mentioned shore, we discovered
on the east side of Cape Teerawhitte, a new inlet I had never observed before. Being tired with
beating against the N.W. winds, I resolved to put into this place if I found it practicable, or to
anchor in the bay which lies before it. The flood being favourable, after making a stretch off, we
fetched under the Cape, and stretched into the bay along the western shore, having from thirty-five
to twelve fathoms, the bottom everywhere good anchorage. At <time>one o'clock</time> we reached the entrance of
the inlet just as the tide of ebb was making out; the wind being likewise against us, we anchored in
twelve fathoms water, the bottom a fine sand. The easternmost of the Black Rocks, which lie on the
larboard side of the entrance of the inlet, bore N. by E., one mile distant; Cape Teerawhitte, or
the west point of the bay, west, distant about two leagues; and the east point of the bay N. by
east, four or five miles.</p><p>Soon after we had anchored, several of the natives came off in their canoes; two from one shore,
and one from the other. It required but little address to get three or four of them on board. These
people were extravagantly fond of nails above every other thing. To one man I gave two cocks and two
hens, which he received with so much indifference, as gave me little hopes he would take proper care
of them.</p><p>We had not been at anchor here above two hours, before the wind veered to N.E., with which we
weighed; but the anchor was hardly at the bows before it shifted to the south. With this we could
but just lead out of the bay, and then bore away for the Sound under all the sail we could set;
having the advantage, or rather disadvantage, of an increasing gale, which already blew too hard. We
hauled up into the Sound just at dark, after making two boards, in which most of our sails were
split; and anchored in eighteen fathoms water, between the White Rocks and the N.W. shore.</p><p>The next morning the gale abated, and was succeeded by a few hours calm; after that a breeze
sprang up at N.W., with which we weighed and ran up into Ship Cove, where we did not find the
Adventure, as was expected.</p></div><div type="chapter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N"><head><l>CHAPTER V.</l><l><emph rend="italic">Transactions at Queen Charlotte's Sound; with an Account of the Inhabitants

the Adventure; with some Description of the Coast.</emph></l></head><p><date>1773 November</date></p><p>The first thing we did after mooring the ship, was to unbend all the sails; there not being one
but what wanted repair. Indeed, both our sails and rigging had sustained much damage in beating off
the Strait's mouth.</p><p>We had no sooner anchored than we were visited by the natives, several of whom I remembered to
have seen when I was here in the Endeavour, particularly an old man named Goubiah. In the <time>afternoon</time>,
I gave orders for all the empty water casks to be landed, in order to be repaired, cleaned, and
filled, tents to be set up for the sail-makers, coopers, and others, whose business made it
necessary for them to be on shore. The next day we began to caulk the ship's sides and decks, to
overhaul her rigging, repair the sails, cut wood for fuel, and set up the smith's forge to repair
the iron-work; all of which were absolutely necessary. We also made some hauls with the seine, but
caught no fish; which deficiency the natives in some measure, made up, by bringing us a good
quantity, and exchanging them for pieces of Otaheitean cloth, &amp;c.</p><p>On the 5th, the most part of our bread being in casks, I ordered some to be opened, when, to our
mortification, we found a good deal of it damaged. To repair this loss in the best manner we could,
all the casks were opened; the bread was picked, and the copper oven set up, to bake such parcels of
it, as, by that means, could be recovered. Some time this morning, the natives stole, out of one of
the tents, a bag of clothes belonging to one of the seamen. As soon as I was informed of it, I went
to them in an adjoining cove, demanded the clothes again, and, after some time spent in friendly
application, recovered them. Since we were among thieves, and had come off so well, I was not sorry
for what had happened, as it taught our people to keep a better lookout for the future.</p><p>With these people I saw the youngest of the two sows Captain Furneaux had put on shore in
Cannibal Cove, when we were last here: It was lame of one of its hind legs; otherwise in good case,
and very tame. If we understood these people right, the boar and other sow were also taken away and
separated, but not killed. We were likewise told, that the two goats I had put on shore up the
Sound, had been killed by that old rascal Goubiah. Thus all our endeavours to stock this country
with useful animals were likely to be frustrated, by the very people we meant to serve. Our gardens
had fared somewhat better. Every thing in them, except the potatoes, they had left entirely to
nature, who had acted her part so well, that we found most articles in a flourishing state: A proof
that the winter must have been mild. The potatoes had most of them been dug up; some, however, still
remained, and were growing, though I think it is probable they will never be got out of the
ground.</p><p>Next morning I sent over to the cove, where the natives reside, to haul the seine; and took with
me a boar, and a young sow, two cocks, and two hens, we had brought from the isles. These I gave to
the natives, being persuaded they would take proper care of them, by their keeping Captain
Furneaux's sow near five months; for I am to suppose it was caught soon after we sailed. We had no
better success with the seine than before; nevertheless we did not return on board quite empty,
having purchased a large quantity from the natives. When we were upon this traffic, they shewed a
great inclination to pick my pockets, and to take away the fish with one hand, which they had just
given me with the other. This evil one of the chiefs undertook to remove, and with fury in his eyes
made a shew of keeping the people at a proper distance. I applauded his conduct, but at the same
time kept so good a look-out, as to detect him in picking my pocket of an handkerchief; which I
suffered him to put in his bosom before I seemed to know any thing of the matter, and then told him
what I had lost. He seemed quite ignorant and innocent, till I took it from him; and then he put it
off with a laugh, acting his part with so much address, that it was hardly possible for me to be
angry with him; so that we remained good friends, and he accompanied me on board to dinner. About
that time, we were visited by several strangers, in four or five canoes, who brought with them fish,
and other articles, which they exchanged for cloth, &amp;c. These newcomers took up their quarters
in a cove near us; but very early the next morning moved off with six of our small water casks; and
with them all the people we found here on our arrival. This precipitate retreat of these last, we
supposed was owing to the theft the others had committed. They left behind them some of their dogs,
and the boar I had given them the day before, which I now took back again as I had not another. Our
casks were the least loss we felt by these people leaving us: While they remained, we were generally
well supplied with fish at a small expence.</p><p>We had fair weather, with the wind at N.E., on the 9th, which gave us some hopes of seeing the
Adventure; but these hopes vanished in the <time>afternoon</time>, when the wind shifted to the westward.</p><p>The next morning, our friends the natives returned again, and brought with them a quantity of
fish, which they exchanged for two hatchets.</p><p>Fair weather on the 12th, enabled us to finish picking, airing, and baking our biscuit; four
thousand two hundred and ninety-two pounds of which we found totally unfit to eat; and about three
thousand pounds more could only be eaten by people in our situation.</p><p>On the 13th, clear and pleasant weather. Early in the morning the natives brought us a quantity
of fish, which they exchanged as usual. But their greatest branch of trade was the green talc or
stone, called by them Poenammoo, a thing of no great value; nevertheless it was so much sought after
by our people, that there was hardly a thing they would not give for a piece of it.</p><p>The 15th being a pleasant morning, a party of us went over to the East Bay, and climbed one of
the hills which overlooked the eastern part of the Strait, in order to look for the Adventure. We
had a fatiguing walk to little purpose; for when we came to the summit, we found the eastern horizon
so foggy, that we could not see above two miles. Mr Forster, who was one of the party, profited by
this excursion, in collecting some new plants. I now began to despair of seeing the Adventure any
more; but was totally at a loss to conceive what was become of her. Till now, I thought she had put
into some port in the Strait, when the wind came to N.W., the day we anchored in the Cove, and
waited to complete her water. This conjecture was reasonable enough at first, but it was now hardly
probable she could be twelve days in our neighbourhood, without our either hearing or seeing
something of her.</p><p>The hill we now mounted is the same that I was upon in 1770, when I had the second view of the
Strait: We then built a tower, with the stones we found there, which we now saw had been levelled to
the ground; no doubt by the natives, with a view of finding something hid in it. When we returned
from the hill, we found a number of them collected round our boat. After some exchanges, and making
them some presents, we embarked, in order to return on board; and, in our way, visited others of the
inhabitants, by whom we were kindly received.</p><p>Our friends, the natives, employed themselves on the 17th in fishing in our neighbourhood; and,
as fast as they caught the fish, came and disposed of them to us; insomuch that we had more than we
could make use of. From this day to the 22d nothing remarkable happened, and we were occupied in
getting every thing in readiness to put to sea, being resolved to wait no longer than the assigned
time for the Adventure.</p><p>The winds were between the south and west, stormy with rain till the 23d, when the weather became
settled, clear, and pleasant. Very early in the morning, we were visited by a number of the natives,
in four or five canoes, very few of whom we had seen before. They brought with them various articles
(curiosities), which they exchanged for Otaheitean cloth, &amp;c. At first, the exchanges were very
much in our favour, till an old man, who was no stranger to us, came and assisted his countrymen
with his advice; which, in a moment, turned the trade above a thousand per cent, against us.</p><p>After these people were gone, I took four hogs (that is, three sows and one boar), two cocks and
two hens, which I landed in the bottom of the West Bay; carrying them a little way into the woods,
where we left them with as much food as would serve them ten or twelve days. This was done with a
view of keeping them in the woods, lest they should come down to the shore in search of food, and be
discovered by the natives; which, however, seemed not probable, as this place had never been
frequented by them; nor were any traces of them to be seen near it. We also left some cocks and hens
in the woods in Ship Cove; but these will have a chance of falling into the hands of the natives,
whose wandering way of life will hinder them from breeding, even suppose they should be taken proper
care of. Indeed, they took rather too much care of those which I had already given them, by keeping
them continually confined, for fear of losing them in the woods. The sow pig we had not seen since
the day they had her from me; but we were now told she was still living, as also the old boar and
sow given them by Captain Furneaux; so that there is reason to hope they may succeed. It will be
unfortunate, indeed, if every method I have taken, to provide this country with useful animals,
should be frustrated. We were likewise told, that the two goats were still alive, and running about;
but I gave more credit to the first story than this. I should have replaced them, by leaving behind
the only two I had left, but had the misfortune to lose the ram soon after our arrival here, in a
manner we could hardly account for. They were both put ashore at the tents, where they seemed to
thrive very well; at last, the ram was taken with fits bordering on madness. We were at a loss to
tell whether it was occasioned by any thing he had eaten, or by being stung with nettles, which were
in plenty about the place; but supposed it to be the latter, and therefore did not take the care of
him we ought to have done. One night, while he was lying by the centinel, he was seized with one of
these fits, and ran headlong into the sea; but soon came out again, and seemed quite easy. Presently
after, he was seized with another fit, and ran along the beach, with the she-goat after him. Some
time after she returned, but the other was never seen more. Diligent search was made for him in the
woods to no purpose; we therefore supposed he had run into the sea a second time, and had been
drowned. After this accident, it would have been in vain to leave the she-goat, as she was not with
kid; having kidded but a few days before we arrived, and the kids dead. Thus the reader will see how
every method I have taken to stock this country with sheep and goats has proved ineffectual.</p><p>When I returned on board in the evening, I found our good friends the natives had brought us a
large supply of fish. Some of the officers visiting them at their habitations, saw, among them, some
human thigh- bones, from which the flesh had been but lately picked. This, and other circumstances,
led us to believe that the people, whom we took for strangers this morning, were of the same tribe;
that they had been out on some war expedition; and that those things they sold us, were the spoils
of their enemies. Indeed, we had some information of this sort the day before; for a number of women
and children came off to us in a canoe, from whom we learnt that a party of men were then out, for
whose safety they were under some apprehension; but this report found little credit with us, as we
soon after saw some canoes come in from fishing, which we judged to be them.</p><p>Having now got the ship in a condition for sea, and to encounter the southern latitudes, I
ordered the tents to be struck, and every thing to be got on board.</p><p>The boatswain, with a party of men, being in the woods cutting broom, some of them found a
private hut of the natives, in which was deposited most of the treasure they had received from us,
as well as some other articles of their own. It is very probable some were set to watch this hut;
as, soon after it was discovered, they came and took all away. But missing some things, they told
our people they had stolen them; and in the evening, came and made their complaint to me, pitching
upon one of the party as the person who had committed the theft. Having ordered this man to be
punished before them, they went away seemingly satisfied; although they did not recover any of the
things they had lost, nor could I by any means find out what had become of them; though nothing was
more certain, than that something had been stolen by some of the party, if not by the very man the
natives had pitched upon. It was ever a maxim with me, to punish the least crimes any of my people
committed against these uncivilized nations. Their robbing us with impunity is, by no means, a
sufficient reason why we should treat them in the same manner, a conduct, we see, they themselves
cannot justify: They found themselves injured, and sought for redress in a legal way. The best
method, in my opinion, to preserve a good understanding with such people, is, first, by shewing them
the use of firearms, to convince them of the superiority they give you over them, and then to be
always upon your guard. When once they are sensible of these things, a regard for their own safety
will deter them from disturbing you, or from being unanimous in forming any plan to attack you; and
strict honesty, and gentle treatment on your part, will make it their interest not to do it.</p><p>Calm or light airs from the north all day on the 23d, hindered us from putting to sea as
intended. In the <time>afternoon</time>, some of the officers went on shore to amuse themselves among the
natives, where they saw the head and bowels of a youth, who had lately been killed, lying on the
beach; and the heart stuck on a forked stick, which was fixed to the head of one of the largest
canoes. One of the gentlemen bought the head, and brought it on board, where a piece of the flesh
was broiled and eaten by one of the natives, before all the officers and most of the men. I was on
shore at this time, but soon after returning on board, was informed of the above circumstances; and
found the quarter-deck crowded with the natives, and the mangled head, or rather part of it, (for
the under-jaw and lip were wanting) lying on the tafferal. The skull had been broken on the left
side, just above the temples; and the remains of the face had all the appearance of a youth under
twenty.</p><p>The sight of the head, and the relation of the above circumstances, struck me with horror, and
filled my mind with indignation against these cannibals. Curiosity, however, got the better of my
indignation, especially when I considered that it would avail but little; and being desirous of
becoming an eye-witness of a fact which many doubted, I ordered a piece of the flesh to be broiled
and brought to the quarter-deck, where one of these cannibals eat it with surprising avidity. This
had such an effect on some of our people as to make them sick. Oedidee (who came on board with me)
was so affected with the sight as to become perfectly motionless, and seemed as if metamorphosed
into the statue of horror. It is utterly impossible for art to describe that passion with half the
force that it appeared in his countenance. When roused from this state by some of us, he burst into
tears; continued to weep and scold by turns; told them they were vile men; and that he neither was,
nor would be any longer their friend. He even would not suffer them to touch him; he used the same
language to one of the gentlemen who cut off the flesh; and refused to accept, or even touch the
knife with which it was done. Such was Oedidee's indignation against the vile custom; and worthy of
imitation by every rational being.</p><p>I was not able to find out the reason for their undertaking this expedition; all I could
understand for certain was, that they went from hence into Admiralty Bay (the next inlet to the
west), and there fought with their enemies, many of whom they killed. They counted to me fifty; a
number which exceeded probability, as they were not more, if so many, themselves. I think I
understood them clearly, that this youth was killed there; and not brought away prisoner, and
afterwards killed. Nor could I learn that they had brought away any more than this one; which
increased the improbability of their having killed so many. We had also reason to think that they
did not come off without loss; for a young woman was seen, more than once, to cut herself, as is the
custom when they lose a friend or relation.</p><p>That the New Zealanders are cannibals, can now no longer be doubted. The account given of this in
my former voyage, being partly founded on circumstances, was, as I afterwards understood,
discredited by many persons. Few consider what a savage man is in his natural state, and even after
he is, in some degree, civilized. The New Zealanders are certainly in some state of civilization;
their behaviour to us was manly and mild, shewing, on all occasions, a readiness to oblige. They
have some arts among them which they execute with great judgment and unwearied patience; they are
far less addicted to thieving than the other islanders of the South Sea; and I believe those in the
same tribe, or such as are at peace one with another, are strictly honest among themselves. This
custom of eating their enemies slain in battle (for I firmly believe they eat the flesh of no
others) has undoubtedly been handed down to them from the earliest times; and we know it is not an
easy matter to wean a nation from their ancient customs, let them be ever so inhuman and savage;
especially if that nation has no manner of connexion or commerce with strangers. For it is by this
that the greatest part of the human race has been civilized; an advantage which the New Zealanders,
from their situation, never had. An intercourse with foreigners would reform their manners, and
polish their savage minds. Or, were they more united under a settled form of government, they would
have fewer enemies, consequently this custom would be less in use, and might in time be in a manner
forgotten. At present, they have but little idea of treating others as themselves would <emph rend="italic">wish</emph> to be treated, but treat them as they <emph rend="italic">expect</emph> to
be treated. If I remember right, one of the arguments they made use of to Tupia, who frequently
expostulated with them against this custom, was, that there could be no harm in killing and eating
the man who would do the same by them if it was in his power. "For," said they, "can there be any
harm in eating our enemies, whom we have killed in battle? Would not those very enemies have done
the same to us?" I have often seen them listen to Tupia with great attention; but I never found his
arguments have any weight with them, or that with all his rhetoric, he could persuade any one of
them that this custom was wrong. And when Oedidee, and several of our people, shewed their
abhorrence of it, they only laughed at them.</p><p>Among many reasons which I have heard assigned for the prevalence of this horrid custom, the want
of animal food has been one; but how far this is deducible either from facts or circumstances, I
shall leave those to find out who advanced it. In every part of New Zealand where I have been, fish
was in such plenty, that the natives generally caught as much as served both themselves and us. They
have also plenty of dogs; nor is there any want of wild fowl, which they know very well how to kill.
So that neither this, nor the want of food of any kind, can, in my opinion, be the reason. But,
whatever it may be, I think it was but too evident, that they have a great liking for this kind of
food.</p><p>I must here observe, that Oedidee soon learnt to converse with these people, as I am persuaded,
he would have done with the people of Amsterdam, had he been a little longer with them; for he did
not understand the New Zealanders, at first, any more, or not so much, as he understood the people
of Amsterdam.</p><p>At <time>four o'clock  in the morning</time>, on the 24th, we unmoored with an intent to put to sea; but the
wind being at N. and N.E. without, and blowing strong puffs into the cove, made it necessary for us
to lie fast. While we were unmooring, some of our old friends came on board to take their leave of
us, and afterwards left the cove with all their effects; but those who had been out on the late
expedition remained; and some of the gentlemen having visited them, found the heart still sticking
on the canoe, and the intestines lying on the beach; but the liver and lungs were now wanting.
Probably they had eaten them, after the carcase was all gone.</p><p>On the 25th, early in the morning, we weighed, with a small, breeze out of the cove, which
carried us no farther than between Motuara and Long Island, where we were obliged to anchor; but
presently after a breeze springing up at north, we weighed again, turned out of the Sound, and stood
over for Cape Teerawhitte.</p><p>During our stay in the Sound, we were plentifully supplied with fish, procured from the natives
at a very easy rate; and, besides the vegetables our own gardens afforded, we found every where
plenty of scurvy grass and cellery, which I caused to be dressed every day for all hands. By this
means, they had been mostly on a fresh diet for the three preceding months; and at this time, we had
neither a sick nor scorbutic man on board. It is necessary to mention, for the information of
others, that we had now some pork on board, salted at Ulietea, and as good as any I ever eat. The
manner in which we cured it, was this: In the cool of the evening the hogs were killed, dressed, cut
up, the bones cut out, and the flesh salted while it was yet hot. The next morning we gave it a
second salting, packed it into a cask, and put to it a sufficient quantity of strong pickle. Great
care is to be taken that the meat be well covered with pickle, otherwise it will soon spoil.</p><p>The morning before we sailed, I wrote a memorandum, setting forth the time we last arrived, the
day we sailed, the route I intended to take, and such other information as I thought necessary for
Captain Furneaux, in case he should put into the Sound; and buried it in a bottle under the root of
a tree in the garden, which is in the bottom of the cove, in such a manner as must be found by him
or any other European who might put into the cove. I, however, had little reason to hope it would
fall into the hands of the person for whom it was intended, thinking it hardly possible that the
Adventure could be in any port in New Zealand, as we had not heard of her all this time.
Nevertheless I was resolved not to leave the coast without looking for her, where I thought it most
likely for her to be. It was with this view that I stood over for Cape Teerawhitte, and afterwards
ran along- shore, from point to point, to Cape Palliser, firing guns every half hour; but all to no
effect. At <time>eight o'clock</time> we brought-to for the night, Cape Palliser bearing S.E. by E. distant three
leagues; in which situation we had fifty fathoms water.</p><p>I had now an opportunity of making the following remarks on the coast between Cape Teerawhitte
and Cape Palliser: The bay which lies on the west side of the last Cape, does not appear to run so
far inland to the northward as I at first thought; the deception being caused by the land in the
bottom of it being low: It is, however, at least five leagues deep, and full as wide at the
entrance. Though it seems to be exposed to southerly and S.W. winds, it is probable there may be
places in the bottom of it sheltered even from these. The bay or inlet, on the east side of Cape
Teerawhitte, before which we anchored, lies in north, inclining to the west, and seemed to be
sheltered from all winds. The middle cape, or point of land that disjoins these two bays, rises to a
considerable height, especially inland; for close to the sea is a skirt of low land, off which lie
some pointed rocks, but so near to the shore as to be noways dangerous. Indeed, the navigation of
this side of the Strait seems much safer than the other, because the tides here are not near so
strong. Cape Teerawhitte and Cape Palliser lie in the direction of N. 69° W., and S. 69° east, from
each other distant ten leagues. The cape which disjoins the two bays above- mentioned lies within,
or north of this direction. All the land near the coast, between and about these capes, is
exceedingly barren; probably owing to its being so much exposed to the cold southerly winds. From
Cape Teerawhitte to the Two Brothers, which lie off Cape Koamoroo, the course is nearly N.W. by N.
distant sixteen miles. North of Cape Teerawhitte, between it and Entry Island, is an island lying
pretty near the shore. I judged this to be an island when I saw it in my former voyage, but not
being certain, left it undetermined in my chart of the Strait, which is the reason of my taking
notice of it now, as also of the bays, &amp;c. above- mentioned.</p><p>At day-light in the morning on the 26th, we made sail round Cape Palliser, firing guns as usual,
as we ran along the shore. In this manner we proceeded till we were three or four leagues to the
N.E. of the Cape; when the wind shifted to N.E., we bore away for Cape Campbell on the other side of
the Strait. Soon after, seeing a smoke ascend, at some distance inland, away to the N.E. we hauled
the wind, and continued to ply till <time>six o'clock  in the evening</time>; which was several hours after the
smoke disappeared, and left us not the least signs of people.</p><p>Every one being unanimously of opinion that the Adventure could neither be stranded on the coast,
nor be in any of the harbours thereof, I gave up looking for her, and all thoughts of seeing her any
more during the voyage, as no rendezvous was absolutely fixed upon after leaving New Zealand.
Nevertheless, this did not discourage me from fully exploring the southern parts of the Pacific
Ocean, in the doing of which I intended to employ the whole of the ensuing season.</p><p>On our quitting the coast, and consequently all hopes of being joined by our consort, I had the
satisfaction to find that not a man was dejected, or thought the dangers we had yet to go through,
were in the least increased by being alone; but as cheerfully proceeding to the south, or wherever I
might think proper to lead them, as if the Adventure, or even more ships, had been in our
company.</p></div><div type="chapter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N"><head><l>CHAPTER VI.</l><l><emph rend="italic">Route of the Ship from New Zealand in Search of a Continent; with an Account of

steered to the south, inclining to the east, having a favourable gale from the N.W. and S.W. We
daily saw some rock-weeds, seals, Port Egmont hens, albatrosses, pintadoes, and other peterels. </p><p><date>1773 December</date></p><p>And on the 2d of December, being in the latitude of <geo select="lat">48° 23' S</geo>outh, longitude <geo select="lon">179° 16' W</geo>est, we
saw a number of red-billed penguins, which remained about us for several days. On the 5th, being in
the latitude <geo select="lat" n="1">50° 17' S</geo>outh, longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">179° 40' E</geo>ast, the variation was 18° 25' east. At half an hour
past <time>eight o'clock</time> the next evening, we reckoned ourselves antipodes to our friends in London,
consequently as far removed from them as possible.</p><p>On the 8th, being in the latitude <geo select="lat">55° 39' S</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon">178° 53' W</geo>est, we ceased to see penguins and
seals, and concluded that those we had seen, retired to the southern parts of New Zealand, whenever
it was necessary for them to be at land. We had now a strong gale at N.W., and a great swell from
S.W. This swell we got as soon as the south point of New Zealand came in that direction; and as we
had had no wind from that quarter the six preceding days, but, on the contrary, it had been at east,
north, and N.W., I conclude there can be no land to the southward, under the meridian of New
Zealand, but what must lie very far to the south. The two following days we had very stormy weather,
sleet and snow, winds between the north and south- west.</p><p>The 11th the storm abated, and the weather clearing up, we found the latitude to be 61° 15'
south, longitude <geo select="lon">173° 4' W</geo>. This fine weather was of short duration; in the evening, the wind
increased to a strong gale at S. W., blew in squalls, attended with thick snow showers, hail, and
sleet. The mercury in the thermometer fell to thirty-two; consequently the weather was very cold,
and seemed to indicate that ice was not far off.</p><p>At <time>four o'clock</time> the next morning, being in the latitude of <geo select="lat">62° 10' S</geo>outh, longitude <geo select="lon">172° W</geo>est, we
saw the first ice island, 11.5° farther south than the first ice we saw the preceding year after
leaving the Cape of Good Hope. At the time we saw this ice, we also saw an antarctic peterel, some
grey albatrosses, and our old companions pintadoes and blue peterels. The wind kept veering from
S.W. by the N.W. to N.N.E. for the most part a fresh gale, attended with a thick haze and snow; on
which account we steered to the S.E. and E., keeping the wind always on the beam, that it might be
in our power to return back nearly on the same track, should our course have been interrupted by any
danger whatever. For some days we had a great sea from the N.W. and S.W., so that it is not probable
there can be any land near, between these two points.</p><p>We fell in with several large islands on the 14th, and about <time>noon</time>, with a quantity of loose ice,
through which we sailed. Latitude <geo select="lat">64° 55' S</geo>outh, longitude <geo select="lon">163° 20' W</geo>est. Grey albatrosses, blue
peterels, pintadoes, and fulmers, were seen. As we advanced to the S.E. by E. with a fresh gale at
west, we found the number of ice islands increase fast upon us. Between <time>noon</time> and eight in the
evening we saw but two; but before <time>four o'clock  in the morning</time> of the 15th, we had passed seventeen,
besides a quantity of loose ice which we ran through. At <time>six o'clock</time>, we were obliged to haul to the
N.E., in order to clear an immense field that lay to the south and S. E. The ice, in most part of
it, lay close packed together; in other places, there appeared partitions in the field, and a clear
sea beyond it. However, I did not think it safe to venture through, as the wind would not permit us
to return the same way that we must go in. Besides, as it blew strong, and the weather at times was
exceedingly foggy, it was the more necessary for us to get clear of this loose ice, which is rather
more dangerous than the great islands. It was not such ice as is usually found in bays or rivers and
near shore; but such as breaks off from the islands, and may not improperly be called parings of the
large pieces, or the rubbish or fragments which fall off when the great islands break loose from the
place where they are formed.</p><p>We had not stood long to the N.E. before we found ourselves embayed by the ice, and were obliged
to tack and stretch to the S.W., having the field, or loose ice, to the south, and many huge islands
to the north. After standing two hours on this tack, the wind very luckily veering to the westward,
we tacked, stretched to the north, and soon got clear of the loose ice; but not before we had
received several hard knocks from the larger pieces, which, with all our care, we could not avoid.
After clearing one danger we still had another to encounter; the weather remained foggy, and many
large islands lay in our way; so that we had to luff for one, and bear up for another. One we were
very near falling aboard of, and, if it had happened, this circumstance would never have been
related. These difficulties, together with the improbability of finding land farther south, and the
impossibility of exploring it, on account of the ice, if we should find any, determined me to get
more to the north. At the time we last tacked, we were in the longitude of <geo select="lon">159° 20' W</geo>., and in the
latitude of <geo select="lat">66° 0' S</geo>. Several penguins were seen on some of these islands, and a few antarctic
peterels on the wing.</p><p>We continued to stand to the north, with a fresh gale at west, attended with thick snow showers,
till <time>eight o'clock  in the evening</time>, when the wind abated, the sky began to clear up, and at <time>six
o'clock in the morning</time> of <date>the 16th</date> it fell calm. Four hours after, it was succeeded by a breeze at
N.E. with which we stretched to the S.E., having thick hazy weather, with snow showers, and all our
rigging coated with ice. In the evening, we attempted to take some up out of the sea, but were
obliged to desist; the sea running too high, and the pieces being so large, that it was dangerous
for the boat to come near them.</p><p>The next morning, being the 17th, we succeeded better; for, falling in with a quantity of loose
ice, we hoisted out two boats; and by <time>noon</time> got on board as much as we could manage. We then made
sail for the east, with a gentle breeze northerly, attended with snow and sleet, which froze to the
rigging as it fell. At this time we were in the latitude of <geo select="lat">64° 41' S</geo>outh, longitude <geo select="lon">155° 44' W</geo>est.
The ice we took up proved to be none of the best, being chiefly composed of frozen snow; on which
account it was porous, and had imbibed a good deal of salt water; but this drained off, after lying
a while on deck, and the water then yielded was fresh. We continued to stretch to the east, with a
piercing cold northerly wind, attended with a thick fog, snow, and sleet, that decorated all our
rigging with icicles. We were hourly meeting with some of the large ice islands, which, in these
high latitudes, render navigation so very dangerous: At seven in the evening, falling in with a
cluster of them, we narrowly escaped running aboard of one, and, with difficulty, wore clear of the
others. We stood back to the west till <time>ten o'clock</time>; at which time the fog cleared away, and we
resumed our course to the east. At <time>noon</time>, the next day, we were in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="1">64° 49' S</geo>.,
longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">149° 19' W</geo>. Some time after, our longitude, by observed distance of the sun and moon, was
<geo select="lon" n="2">149° 19' W</geo>.; by Mr Kendal's watch 148° 36'; and, by my reckoning, 148° 43', latitude <geo select="lat" n="2">64° 48' S</geo>.</p><p>The clear weather, and the wind veering to N.W., tempted me to steer south; which course we
continued till seven in the morning of the 20th, when the wind changing to N.E. and the sky becoming
clouded, we hauled up S.E. In the <time>afternoon</time> the wind increased to a strong gale, attended with a
thick fog, snow, sleet, and rain, which constitutes the very worst of weather. Our rigging, at this
time, was so loaded with ice, that we had enough to do to get our topsails down, to double the reef.
At <time>seven o'clock  in the evening</time>, in the longitude of 147° 46', we came, the second time, within the
antarctic or polar circle, continuing our course to the S.E. till <time>six o'clock</time> the next morning. At
that time, being in the latitude of <geo select="lat">67° 5' S</geo>., all at once we got in among a cluster of very large
ice islands, and a vast quantity of loose pieces; and as the fog was exceedingly thick, it was with
the utmost difficulty we wore clear of them. This done, we stood to the N.W. till <time>noon</time>, when, the
fog being somewhat dissipated, we resumed our course again to the S.E. The ice islands we met with
in the morning were very high and rugged, forming at their tops, many peaks; whereas the most of
those we had seen before, were flat at top, and not so high; though many of them were between two
and three hundred feet in height, and between two and three miles in circuit, with perpendicular
cliffs or sides, astonishing to behold. Most or our winged companions had now left us; the grey
albatrosses only remained; and, instead of the other birds, we were visited by a few antarctic
peterels.</p><p>The 22d we steered E.S.E. with a fresh gale at north, blowing in squalls, one of which took hold
of the mizen top-sail, tore it all to rags, and rendered it forever after useless. At <time>six o'clock</time> in
the morning, the wind veering towards the west, our course was east northerly. At this time we were
in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="1">67° 31' S</geo> , the highest we had yet been in, longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">142° 54' W</geo>.</p><p>We continued our course to the E. by N. till <time>noon</time>, the 23d, when being in the latitude of<geo select="lat" n="1">67° 
12' S</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">138° 0' W</geo>, we steered S.E.; having then twenty-three ice islands in sight, from off the
deck, and twice that number from the mast-head; and yet we could not see above two or three miles
round us. At <time>four o'clock</time> in the <time>afternoon</time>, in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="2">67° 20' S</geo> , longitude <geo select="lon" n="2">137° 12' W</geo>, we fell
in with such a quantity of field, or loose ice, as covered the sea in the whole extent from south to
east, and was so thick and close as wholly to obstruct our passage. At this time, the wind being
pretty moderate, and the sea smooth, we brought-to, at the outer edge of the ice, hoisted out two
boats, and sent them to take some up. In the mean time, we laid hold of several large pieces
along-side, and got them on board with our tackle. The taking up ice proved such cold work, that it
was <time>eight o'clock</time> by the time the boats had made two trips, when we hoisted them in, and made sail
to the west, under double-reefed top-sails and courses, with a strong gale at north, attended with
snow and sleet, which froze to the rigging as it fell, making the ropes like wires, and the sails
like boards or plates of metal. The sheaves also were frozen so fast in the blocks, that it required
our utmost efforts to get a top-sail down and up; the cold so intense as hardly to be endured; the
whole sea, in a manner, covered with ice; a hard gale, and a thick fog.</p><p>Under all these unfavourable circumstances, it was natural for me to think of returning more to
the north; seeing no probability of finding any land here, nor a possibility of getting farther
south. And to have proceeded to the east in this latitude, must have been wrong, not only on account
of the ice, but because we must have left a vast space of sea to the north unexplored, a space of
24° of latitude; in which a large tract of land might have lain. Whether such a supposition was
well-grounded, could only be determined by visiting those parts.</p><p>While we were taking up ice, we got two of the antarctic peterels so often mentioned, by which
our conjectures were confirmed of their being of the peterel tribe. They are about the size of a
large pigeon; the feathers of the head, back, and part of the upper side of the wings, are of a
light- brown; the belly, and under side of the wings white, the tail feathers are also white, but
tipped with brown; at the same time, we got another new peterel, smaller than the former, and all of
a dark-grey plumage. We remarked that these birds were fuller of feathers than any we had hitherto
seen; such care has nature taken to clothe them suitably to the climate in which they live. At the
same time we saw a few chocolate-coloured albatrosses; these, as well as the peterels
above-mentioned, we no where saw but among the ice; hence one may with reason conjecture that there
is land to the south. If not, I must ask where these birds breed? A question which perhaps will
never be determined; for hitherto we have found these lands, if any, quite inaccessible. Besides
these birds, we saw a very large seal, which kept playing about us some time. One of our people who
had been at Greenland, called it a sea-horse; but every one else took it for what I have said. Since
our first falling in with the ice, the mercury in the thermometer had been from 33 to 31 at
<time>noon</time>-day.</p><p>On the 24th, the wind abated, veering to the N.W., and the sky cleared up, in the latitude of<geo select="lat">67°
0' S</geo> longitude <geo select="lon">138° 15' W</geo>. As we advanced to the N.E. with a gentle gale at N.W., the ice islands
increased so fast upon us, that this day, at <time>noon</time>, we could see near 100 round us, besides an
immense number of small pieces. Perceiving that it was likely to be calm, I got the ship into as
clear a birth as I could, where she drifted along with the ice, and by taking the advantage of every
light air of wind, was kept from falling aboard any of these floating isles. Here it was we spent
Christmas day, much in the same manner as we did the preceding one. We were fortunate in having
continual day-light, and clear weather, for had it been as foggy as on some of the preceding days,
nothing less than a miracle could have saved us from being dashed to pieces.</p><p>In the morning of the 26th, the whole sea was in a manner covered with ice, 200 large islands,
and upwards, being seen within the compass of four or five miles, which was the limits of our
horizon, besides smaller pieces innumerable. Our latitude at <time>noon</time> was <geo select="lat">66° 15' S</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon">134° 22' W</geo>.
By observation we found that the ship had drifted, or gone about 20 miles to the N.E. or E.N.E.;
whereas, by the ice islands, it appeared that she had gone little or nothing; from which we
concluded that the ice drifted nearly in the same direction, and at the same rate. At <time>four o'clock</time> a
breeze sprung up at W.S.W., and enabled us to steer north, the most probable course to extricate
ourselves from these dangers.</p><p>We continued our course to the north with a gentle breeze at west, attended with clear weather,
till <time>four o'clock</time> the next morning, when meeting with a quantity of loose ice, we brought-to, and
took on board as much as filled all our empty casks, and for several days present expence. This
done, we made sail, and steered N.W. with a gentle breeze at N.E., clear frosty weather. Our
latitude at this time was <geo select="lat">65° 53' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">133° 42' W</geo>.; islands of ice not half so numerous as
before.</p><p>At four in the morning of the 28th, the wind having veered more to the E. and S.E., increased to
a fresh gale, and was attended with snow showers. Our course was north till <time>noon</time> the next day. Being
then in the latitude of <geo select="lat">62° 24' S</geo> , longitude <geo select="lon">134° 37' W</geo>, we steered N.W. by N. Some hours after, the sky
cleared up, and the wind abating, veered more to the south.</p><p>On the 30th, had little wind westerly; dark gloomy weather; with snow and sleet at times; several
whales seen playing about the ship, but very few birds; islands of ice in plenty, and a swell from
W.N.W.</p><p>On the 31st, little wind from the westward, fair and clear weather, which afforded an opportunity
to air the spare sails, and to clean and smoke the ship between decks. At <time>noon</time> our latitude was<geo select="lat">59° 
40' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">135° 11' W</geo>. Our observation to-day gave us reason to conjecture that we had a
southerly current. Indeed, this was no more than what might reasonably be supposed, to account for
such huge masses of ice being brought from the south. In the <time>afternoon</time> we had a few hours calm,
succeeded by a breeze from the east, which enabled us to resume our N.W. by N. course.</p><p><date>1774 January</date></p><p>January 1st, the wind remained not long at east, but veered round by the south to the west; blew
fresh, attended with snow showers. In the evening, being in the latitude of <geo select="lat">58° 39' S</geo>., we passed
two islands of ice, after which we saw no more till we stood again to the south.</p><p>At <time>five o'clock  in the morning</time> on the 2d, it fell calm; being at this time in the latitude of<geo select="lat">58° 
2' S</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon">137° 12' W</geo>. The calm being succeeded by a breeze at east, we steered N.W. by W. My
reason for steering this course, was to explore part of the great space of sea between us and our
track to the south.</p><p>On the 3d, at <time>noon</time>, being in latitude <geo select="lat">56° 46' S</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon">139° 45' W</geo>, the weather became fair, and
the wind veered to S.W. About this time we saw a few small divers (as we call them) of the peterel
tribe, which we judged to be such as are usually seen near land, especially in the bays, and on the
coast of New Zealand. I cannot tell what to think of these birds; had there been more of them, I
should have been ready enough to believe that we were, at this time, not very far from land, as I
never saw one so far from known land before. Probably these few had been drawn thus far by some
shoal of fish; for such were certainly about us, by the vast number of blue peterels, albatrosses,
and such other birds as are usually seen in the great ocean; all or most of which left us before
night. Two or three pieces of seaweed were also seen, but these appeared old and decayed.</p><p>At <time>eight o'clock  in the evening</time>, being in the latitude of <geo select="lat">56° S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">140° 31' W</geo>., the wind
fixing in the western board, obliged us to steer north-easterly, and laid me under the necessity of
leaving unexplored a space of the sea to the west, containing near 40° of longitude, and half that
of latitude. Had the wind continued favourable, I intended to have run 15 or 20 degrees of longitude
more to the west in the latitude we were then in, and back again to the east in the latitude of 50°.
This route would have so intersected the space above mentioned, as hardly to have left room for the
bare supposition of any land lying there. Indeed, as it was, we have little reason to believe that
there is; but rather the contrary, from the great hollow swell we had had, for several days, from
the W. and N.W., though the wind had blown from a contrary direction great part of the time; which
is a great sign we had not been covered by any land between these two points.</p><p>While we were in the high latitudes, many of our people were attacked with a slight fever,
occasioned by colds. It happily yielded to the simplest remedies; was generally removed in a few
days; and, at this time, we had not above one or two on the sick list.</p><p>We proceeded N.E. by N. till the 6th, at <time>noon</time>. Being then in the latitude of <geo select="lat">52° 0' S</geo>., longitude
<geo select="lon">135° 32' W</geo>., and about 200 leagues from our track to Otaheite, in which space it was not probable,
all circumstances considered, there is any extensive land, and it being still less probable any lay
to the west, from the great mountainous billows we had had, and still continued to have, from that
quarter, I therefore steered N.E., with a fresh gale at W.S.W.</p><p>At <time>eight o'clock  in the morning</time>, on the 7th, being in the latitude of <geo select="lat">50° 49' S</geo>., we observed
several distances of the sun and moon, which gave the longitude as follows, viz.</p><p>By Mr. Wales, <geo select="lon">133° 24' 0" W</geo>est.        Gilbert, 133 10 0        Clarke, 133 0 0        Smith, 133

                                     ——————- Variation of the compass, 6 2 0 East.
             thermometer, 50 0 0 </p><p>The next morning we observed again, and the results were agreeable to the preceding observations,
allowing for the ship's run. I must here take notice, that our longitude can never be erroneous,
while we have so good a guide as Mr Kendall's watch. This day, at <time>noon</time>, we steered E.N.E. 1/2 E.,
being then in the latitude of <geo select="lat">49° 7' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">131° 2' W</geo>.</p><p>On the 9th, in latitude <geo select="lat">48° 17' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">127° 10' W</geo>., we steered east, with a fine fresh
gale at west, attended with clear pleasant weather, and a great swell from the same direction as the
wind.</p><p>In the morning of the 10th, having but little wind, we put a boat in the water, in which some of
the officers went and shot several birds. These afforded us a fresh meal; they were of the peterel
tribe, and such as are usually seen at any distance from land. Indeed, neither birds, nor any other
thing was to be seen, that could give us the least hopes of finding any; and, therefore, at <time>noon</time> the
next day, being then in the latitude of <geo select="lat">47° 51' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">122° 12' W</geo>., and a little more than
200 leagues from my track to Otaheite in 1769, I altered the course, and steered S.E., with a fresh
gale at S.W. by W. In the evening, when our latitude was <geo select="lat" n="1">48° 22' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">121° 29' W</geo>., we found
the variation to be 2° 34' E., which is the least variation we had found without the tropic. In the
evening of the next day, we found it to be 4° 30' E., our latitude, at that time, was <geo select="lat" n="2">50° 5' S</geo>.,
longitude <geo select="lon" n="2">119.5° W</geo>.</p><p>Our course was now more southerly, till the evening of the 13th, when we were in the latitude of
<geo select="lat" n="1">53° 0' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">118° 3' W</geo>. The wind being then at N.W. a strong gale with a thick fog and rain,
which made it unsafe to steer large, I hauled up S.W., and continued this course till <time>noon</time> the next
day, when our latitude was <geo select="lat" n="2">56° 4' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="2">122° 1' W</geo>. The wind having veered to the north, and
the fog continuing, I hauled to the east, under courses and close-reefed top-sails. But this sail we
could not carry long; for before <time>eight o'clock  in the evening</time>, the wind increased to a perfect
storm, and obliged us to lie-to, under the mizen-stay-sail, till the morning of the 16th, when the
wind having a good deal abated, and veered to west, we set the courses, reefed top-sails, and stood
to the south. Soon after, the weather cleared up, and, in the evening, we found the latitude to be
<geo select="lat" n="3">56° 48' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="3">119° 8' W</geo>. We continued to steer to the south, inclining to the east, till the
18th, when we stood to the S.W., with the wind at S.E., being at this time in the latitude of<geo select="lat" n="4"> 61° 9' S</geo> 
S., longitude <geo select="lon" n="4">116° 7' W</geo>. At <time>ten o'clock  in the evening</time>, it fell calm, which continued till two the
next morning, when a breeze sprung up at north, which soon after increased to a fresh gale, and
fixed at N.E. With this we steered south till <time>noon</time> on the 20th, when, being now in the latitude of
<geo select="lat" n="5">62° 34' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="5">116° 24' W</geo>., we were again becalmed.</p><p>In this situation we had two ice islands in sight, one of which seemed to be as large as any we
had seen. It could not be less than two hundred feet in height, and terminated in a peak not unlike
the cupola of St Paul's church. At this time we had a great westerly swell, which made it improbable
that any land should lie between us and the meridian of 133.5°, which was our longitude, under the
latitude we were now in, when we stood to the north. In all this route we had not seen the least
thing that could induce us to think we were ever in the neighbourhood of any land. We had, indeed,
frequently seen pieces of sea-weed; but this, I am well assured, is no sign of the vicinity of land;
for weed is seen in every part of the ocean. After a few hours calm, we got a wind from S.E.; but it
was very unsettled, and attended with thick snow-showers; at length it fixed at S. by E., and we
stretched to the east. The wind blew fresh, was piercing cold, and attended with snow and sleet. On
the 22d, being in the latitude of <geo select="lat">62° 5' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">112° 24' W</geo>., we saw an ice island, an
antartic peterel, several blue peterels, and some other known birds; but no one thing that gave us
the least hopes of finding land.</p><p>On the 23d, at <time>noon</time>, we were in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="1">62° 22' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">110° 24' W</geo>. In the <time>afternoon</time>,
we passed an ice island. The wind, which blew fresh, continued to veer to the west; and at eight
o'clock the next morning it was to the north of west, when I steered S. by W. and S.S.W. At this
time we were in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="2">63° 20' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="2">108° 7' W</geo>., and had a great sea from S.W. We
continued this course till <time>noon</time> the next day, the 25th, when we steered due south. Our latitude, at
this time, was <geo select="lat" n="3">65° 24' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="3">109° 31' W</geo>.; the wind was at north; the weather mild and not
unpleasant; and not a bit of ice in view. This we thought a little extraordinary, as it was but a
month before, and not quite two hundred leagues to the east, that we were in a manner blocked up
with large islands of ice in this very latitude. Saw a single pintadoe peterel, some blue peterels,
and a few brown albatrosses. In the evening, being <geo select="lon" n="4">109° 31' W</geo> under the same meridian, and in the latitude of
<geo select="lat" n="4">65° 44' S</geo>., the variation was 19° 27' E.; but the next morning, in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="5">66° 20' S</geo>.,
longitude <geo select="lon" n="5">109° 31' W</geo> the same as before, it was only 18° 20' E.; probably the mean between the two is the
nearest the truth. At this time, we had nine small islands in sight; and soon after we came, the
third time, within the antartic polar circle, in the longitude of <geo select="lon">109° 31' W</geo>. About <time>noon</time>, seeing the
appearance of land to the S.E., we immediately trimmed our sails and stood towards it. Soon after it
disappeared, but we did not give it up till <time>eight o'clock</time> the next morning, when we were well
assured that it was nothing but clouds, or a fog bank; and then we resumed our course to the south,
with a gentle breeze at N.E., attended with a thick fog, snow, and sleet.</p><p>We now began to meet with ice islands more frequently than before; and, in the latitude of<geo select="lat" n="1">69° 
38' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">108° 12' W</geo>., we fell in with a field of loose ice. As we began to be in want of
water, I hoisted out two boats and took up as much as yielded about ten tons. This was cold work,
but it was now familiar to us. As soon as we had done, we hoisted in the boats, and afterwards made
short boards over that part of the sea we had in some measure made ourselves acquainted with. For we
had now so thick a fog, that we could not see two hundred yards round us; and as we knew not the
extent of the loose ice, I durst not steer to the south till we had clear weather. Thus we spent the
night, or rather that part of twenty-four hours which answered to night; for we had no darkness but
what was occasioned by fogs.</p><p>At <time>four o'clock  in the morning</time> of the 29th, the fog began to clear away; and the day becoming
clear and serene, we again steered to the south with a gentle gale at N.E. and N.N.E. The variation
was found to be <geo select="lon">22° 41' E</geo>. This was in the latitude of <geo select="lat">69° 45' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">108° 5' W</geo>.; and, in the
<time>afternoon</time>, being in the same longitude, and in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="1">70° 23' S</geo>., it was <geo select="lon" n="1">24° 31' E</geo>. Soon
after, the sky became clouded, and the air very cold. We continued our course to the south, and
passed a piece of weed covered with barnacles, which a brown albatross was picking off. At ten
o'clock, we passed a very large ice island; it was not less than three or four miles in circuit.
Several more being seen a-head, and the weather becoming foggy, we hauled the wind to the northward;
but in less than two hours, the weather cleared up, and we again stood south.</p><p>On the 30th, at <time>four o'clock  in the morning</time>, we perceived the clouds, over the horizon to the
south, to be of an unusual snow-white brightness, which we knew denounced our approach to field-ice.
Soon after, it was seen from the top-mast-head; and at <time>eight o'clock</time>, we were close to its edge. It
extended east and west, far beyond the reach of our sight. In the situation we were in, just the
southern half of our horizon was illuminated, by the rays of light reflected from the ice, to a
considerable height. Ninety- seven ice hills were distinctly seen within the field, besides those on
the outside; many of them very large, and looking like a ridge of mountains, rising one above
another till they were lost in the clouds. The outer or northern edge of this immense field, was
composed of loose or broken ice close packed together, so that it was not possible for any thing to
enter it. This was about a mile broad, within which, was solid ice in one continued compact body. It
was rather low and flat (except the hills), but seemed to increase in height, as you traced it to
the south; in which direction it extended beyond our sight. Such mountains of ice as these, I
believe, were never seen in the Greenland seas, at least, not that I ever heard or read of, so that
we cannot draw a comparison between the ice here and there.</p><p>It must be allowed, that these prodigious ice mountains must add such additional weight to the
ice fields which inclose them, as cannot but make a great difference between the navigating this icy
sea and that of Greenland.</p><p>I will not say it was impossible any where to get farther to the south; but the attempting it
would have been a dangerous and rash enterprise, and what, I believe, no man in my situation would
have thought of. It was, indeed, <emph rend="italic">my</emph> opinion, as well as the opinion of
most on board, that this ice extended quite to the pole, or perhaps joined on some land, to which it
had been fixed from the earliest time; and that it is here, that is to the south of this parallel,
where all the ice we find scattered up and down to the north, is first formed, and afterwards broken
off by gales of wind, or other causes, and brought to the north by the currents, which we always
found to set in that direction in the high latitudes. As we drew near this ice some penguins were
heard, but none seen; and but few other birds or any other thing that could induce us to think any
land was near. And yet I think, there must be some to the south behind this ice; but if there is, it
can afford no better retreat for birds, or any other animals, than the ice itself, with which it
must be wholly covered. I, who had ambition not only to go farther than any one had been before, but
as far as it was possible for man to go, was not sorry at meeting with this interruption, as it in
some measure relieved us, at least shortened the dangers and hardships inseparable from the
navigation of the southern polar regions. Since, therefore, we could not proceed one inch farther to
the south, no other reason need be assigned for my tacking and standing back to the north; being at
this time in the latitude of <geo select="lat">71° 10' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">106° 54' W</geo>.</p><p>It was happy for us that the weather was clear when we fell in with this ice, and that we
discovered it so soon as we did; for we had no sooner tacked than we were involved in a thick fog.
The wind was at east, and blew a fresh breeze, so that we were enabled to return back over that
space we had already made ourselves acquainted with. At <time>noon</time>, the mercury in the thermometer stood
at 32-1/2, and we found the air exceedingly cold. The thick fog continuing with showers of snow,
gave a coat of ice to our rigging of near an inch thick. In the <time>afternoon</time> of the next day the fog
cleared away at intervals; but the weather was cloudy and gloomy, and the air excessively cold;
however, the sea within our horizon was clear of ice.</p><p><date>1774 February</date></p><p>We continued to stand to the north, with the wind easterly, till the <time>afternoon</time> on the first of
February, when falling in with some loose ice which had been broken from an island to windward we
hoisted out two boats, and having taken some on board, resumed our course to the N. and N.E., with
gentle breezes from S.E., attended sometimes with fair weather, and at other times with snow and
sleet. On the 4th we were in the latitude of <geo select="lat">65° 42' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">99° 44' W</geo>. The next day the wind
was very unsettled both in strength and position, and attended with snow and sleet. At length, on
the 6th, after a few hours calm, we got a breeze at south, which soon after freshened, fixed at
W.S.W., and was attended with snow and sleet.</p><p>I now came to the resolution to proceed to the north, and to spend the ensuing winter within the
tropic, if I met with no employment before I came there. I was now well satisfied no continent was
to be found in this ocean, but what must lie so far to the south, as to be wholly inaccessible on
account of ice; and that if one should be found in the southern Atlantic Ocean, it would be
necessary to have the whole summer before us to explore it. On the other hand, upon a supposition
that there is no land there, we undoubtedly might have reached the Cape of Good Hope by April, and
so have put an end to the expedition, so far as it related to the finding a continent; which indeed
was the first object of the voyage. But for me at this time to have quitted the southern Pacific
Ocean, with a good ship expressly sent out on discoveries, a healthy crew, and not in want either of
stores or of provisions, would have been betraying not only a want of perseverance, but of judgment,
in supposing the south Pacific Ocean to have been so well explored, that nothing remained to be done
in it. This, however, was not my opinion; for though I had proved that there was no continent but
what must lie far to the south, there remained nevertheless room for very large islands in places
wholly unexamined; and many of those which were formerly discovered, are but imperfectly explored,
and their situations as imperfectly known. I was besides of opinion, that my remaining in this sea
some time longer, would be productive of improvements in navigation and geography, as well as in
other sciences. I had several times communicated my thoughts on this subject to Captain Furneaux;
but as it then wholly depended on what we might meet with to the south, I could not give it in
orders, without running a risk of drawing us from the main object. Since now nothing had happened to
prevent me from, carrying these views into execution, my intention was first to go in search of the
land said to have been discovered by Juan Fernandez, above a century ago, in about the latitude of
38°; if I should fail in finding this land, then to go in search of Easter Island or Davis's Land,
whose situation was known with so little certainty, that the attempts lately made to find it had
miscarried. I next intended to get within the tropic, and then proceed to the west, touching at, and
settling the situations of such islands as we might meet with till we arrived at Otaheite, where it
was necessary I should stop to look for the Adventure. I had also thoughts of running as far west as
the Tierra Austral del Espiritu Santo, discovered by Quiros, and which M. de Bougainville calls the
Great Cyclades. Quiros speaks of this land as being large, or lying in the neighbourhood of large
lands; and as this was a point which M. de Bougainville had neither confirmed nor refuted, I thought
it was worth clearing up. From this land my design was to steer to the south, and so back to the
east, between the latitudes of 50° and 60°; intending, if possible, to be the length of Cape Horn in
November next, when we should have the best part of the summer before us to explore the southern
part of the Atlantic Ocean. Great as this design appeared to be, I however thought it possible to be
executed; and when I came to communicate it to the officers, I had the satisfaction to find, that
they all heartily concurred in it. I should not do these gentlemen justice, if I did not take some
opportunity to declare, that they always shewed the utmost readiness to carry into execution, in the
most effectual manner, every measure I thought proper to take. Under such circumstances, it is
hardly necessary to say, that the seamen were always obedient and alert; and, on this occasion, they
were so far from wishing the voyage at an end, that they, rejoiced at the prospect of its being
prolonged another year, and of soon enjoying the benefits of a milder climate.</p><p>I now steered north, inclining to the east, and in the evening we were overtaken with a furious
storm at W.S.W., attended with snow and sleet. It came so suddenly upon us, that before we could
take in our sails, two old top-sails, which we had bent to the yards, were blown to pieces, and the
other sails much damaged. The gale lasted, without the least intermission, till the next morning,
when it began to abate; it continued, however, to blow very fresh till <time>noon</time> on the 12th, when it
ended in a calm.</p><p>At this time we were in the latitude of <geo select="lat">50° 14' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">95° 18' W</geo>. Some birds being about
the ship, we took the advantage of the calm to put a boat in the water, and shot several birds, on
which we feasted the next day. One of these birds was of that sort which has been so often mentioned
in this journal under the name of Port Egmont hens. They are of the gull kind, about the size of a
raven, with a dark-brown plumage, except the under-side of each wing, where there are some white
feathers. The rest of the birds were albatrosses and sheer-waters.</p><p>After a few hours calm, having got a breeze at N.W., we made a stretch to the S.W. for
twenty-four hours; in which route we saw a piece of wood, a bunch of weed, and a diving peterel. The
wind having veered more to the west, made us tack and stretch to the north till <time>noon</time> on the 14th, at
which time we were in the latitude of <geo select="lat">49° 32' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">95° 11' W</geo>. We had now calms and light
breezes, succeeding each other, till the next morning, when the wind freshened at W.N.W., and was
attended with a thick fog and drizzling rain the three following days, during which time we
stretched to the north, inclining to the east, and crossed my track to Otaheite in 1769. I did
intend to have kept more to the west, but the strong winds from that direction put it out of my
power.</p><p>On the 18th, the wind veered to S.W., and blew very fresh, but was attended with clear weather,
which gave us an opportunity to ascertain our longitude by several lunar observations made by Messrs
Wales, Clarke, Gilbert, and Smith. The mean result of all, was <geo select="lon">94° 19' 30" W</geo>.; Mr Kendal's watch, at
the same time, gave <geo select="lon">94° 46' W</geo>.; our latitude was <geo select="lat">43° 53' S</geo>. The wind continued not long at S.W.
before it veered back to the west and W.N.W.</p><p>As we advanced to the north, we felt a most sensible change in the weather. The 20th, at <time>noon</time>, we
were in the latitude of <geo select="lat">39° 58' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">94° 37' W</geo>. The day was clear and pleasant, and I may
say, the only summer's day we had had since we left New Zealand. The mercury in the thermometer rose
to 66.</p><p>We still continued to steer to the north, as the wind remained in the old quarter; and the next
day, at <time>noon</time>, we were in the latitude <geo select="lat">37° 54' S</geo>.; which was the same that Juan Fernandez's discovery
is said to lie in. We, however, had not the least signs of any land lying in our neighbourhood.</p><p>The next day at <time>noon</time>, we were in latitude <geo select="lat">36° 10' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">94° 56' W</geo>. Soon after, the wind
veered to S.S.E., and enabled us to steer W.S.W., which I thought the most probable direction to
find the land of which we were in search; and yet I had no hopes of succeeding, as we had a large
hollow swell from the same point. We however continued this course till the 25th, when the wind
having veered again round to the westward, I gave it up, and stood away to the north, in order to
get into the latitude of Easter Island: our latitude, at this time, was <geo select="lat" n="1">37° 52' S</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">101° 10' W</geo>
W.</p><p>I was now well assured that the discovery of Juan Fernandez, if any such was ever made, can be
nothing but a small island; there being hardly room for a large land, as will fully appear by the
tracks of Captain Wallis, Bougainville, of the Endeavour, and this of the Resolution. Whoever wants
to see an account of the discovery in question, will meet with it in Mr Dalrymple's collection of
voyages to the south seas. This gentleman places it under the meridian of 90°, where I think it
cannot be; for M. de Bougainville seems to have run down under that meridian; and we had now
examined the latitude in which it is said to lie, from the meridian of 94° to 101°. It is not
probable it can lie to the east of 90°; because if it did, it must have been seen, at one time or
other, by ships bound from the northern to the southern parts of America. Mr Pengré, in a little
treatise concerning the transit of Venus, published in 1768, gives some account of land having been
discovered by the Spaniards in 1714, in the latitude of <geo select="lat">38° S</geo> , and 550 leagues from the coast of
Chili, which is in the longitude of 110° or <geo select="lon">111° W</geo>est, and within a degree or two of my track in the
Endeavour; so that this can hardly be its situation. In short, the only probable situation it can
have must be about the meridian of 106° or <geo select="lon">108° W</geo>est; and then it can only be a small isle, as I
have already observed.</p><p>I was now taken ill of the bilious cholic, which was so violent as to confine me to my bed, so
that the management of the ship was left to Mr Cooper the first officer, who conducted her very much
to my satisfaction. It was several days before the most dangerous symptoms of my disorder were
removed; during which time, Mr Patten the surgeon was to me, not only a skilful physician, but an
affectionate nurse; and I should ill deserve the care he bestowed on me, if I did not make this
public acknowledgment. When I began to recover, a favourite dog belonging to Mr Forster fell a
sacrifice to my tender stomach. We had no other fresh meat on board, and I could eat of this flesh,
as well as broth made of it, when I could taste nothing else. Thus I received nourishment and
strength from food which would have made most people in Europe sick: So true it is, that necessity
is governed by no law.</p><p>On the 28th, in the latitude of <geo select="lat">33° 7' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">102° 33' W</geo>., we began to see flying-fish,
egg-birds, and nodies, which are said not to go above sixty or eighty leagues from land; but of this
we have no certainty. No one yet knows to what distance any of the oceanic birds go to sea; for my
own part, I do not believe there is one in the whole tribe that can be relied on, in pointing out
the vicinity of land.</p><p>In the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="1">30° 30' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">101° 45' W</geo>., we began to see men- of-war birds. In the
latitude of<geo select="lat" n="2"> 29° 44' S</geo> , longitude <geo select="lon" n="2">100° 45' W</geo>., we had a calm for nearly two days together, during which
time the heat was intolerable; but what ought to be remarked, there was a great swell from the
S.W.</p><p><date>1774 March</date></p><p>On the 6th of March, the calm was succeeded by an easterly wind, with which we steered N.W. till
<time>noon</time> the 8th, when being in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="1">27° 4' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">103° 58' W</geo>., we steered west;
meeting every day with great numbers of birds, such as men-of-war, tropic, and egg-birds, podies,
sheer-waters, &amp;c. and once we passed several pieces of sponge, and a small dried leaf not unlike
a bay one. Soon after, we saw a sea-snake, in every respect like those we had before seen at the
tropical islands. We also saw plenty of fish, but we were such bad fishers that we caught only four
albacores, which were very acceptable, to me especially, who was just recovering from my late
illness.</p></div><div type="chapter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N"><head><l>CHAPTER VII.</l><l><emph rend="italic">Sequel of the Passage from New Zealand to Easter Island, and Transactions there,
with an Account of an Expedition to discover the Inland Part of the Country, and a Description of
some of the surprising gigantic Statues found in the Island.</emph></l></head><p><date>1774 March</date></p><p>At <time>eight o'clock  in the morning</time>, on the 11th, land was seen, from the mast- head, bearing west,
and at <time>noon</time> from the deck, extending from W. 3/4 N. to W. by S., about twelve leagues distant. I
made no doubt that this was Davis's Land, or Easter Island; as its appearance from this situation,
corresponded very well with Wafer's account; and we expected to have seen the low sandy isle that
Davis fell in with, which would have been a confirmation; but in this we were disappointed. At <time>seven
o'clock in the evening</time>, the island bore from north <geo select="lon">62° W</geo>., to north <geo select="lon">87° W</geo>., about five leagues
distant; in which situation, we sounded without finding ground with a line of an hundred and forty
fathoms. Here we spent the night, having alternately light airs and calms, till <time>ten o'clock</time> the next
morning, when a breeze sprung up at W.S.W. With this we stretched in for the land; and by the help
of our glass, discovered people, and some of those Colossean statues or idols mentioned in the
account of Roggewein's voyage. At <time>four o'clock</time> p.m. we were half a league S.S.E. and N.N.W. of the
N.E. point of the island; and, on sounding, found thirty-five fathoms, a dark sandy bottom. I now
tacked, and endeavoured to get into what appeared to be a bay, on the west side of the point or S.E.
side of the island; but before this could be accomplished, night came upon us, and we stood on and
off, under the land, till the next morning; having sounding from seventy-five to an hundred and ten
fathoms, the same bottom as before.</p><p>On the 13th, about <time>eight o'clock  in the morning</time>, the wind, which had been variable most part of
the night, fixed at S.E., and blew in squalls, accompanied with rain; but it was not long before the
weather became fair. As the wind now blew right to the S.E. shore, which does not afford that
shelter I at first thought, I resolved to look for anchorage on the west and N.W. sides of the
island. With this view I bore up round the south point, off which lie two small islets, the one
nearest the point high and peaked, and the other low and flattish. After getting round the point,
and coming before a sandy beach, we found soundings thirty and forty fathoms, sandy ground, and
about one mile from the shore. Here a canoe, conducted by two men, came off to us. They brought with
them a bunch of plantains, which they sent into the ship by a rope, and then they returned ashore.
This gave us a good opinion of the islanders, and inspired us with hopes of getting some
refreshments, which we were in great want of.</p><p>I continued to range along the coast, till we opened the northern point of the isle, without
seeing a better anchoring-place than the one we had passed. We therefore tacked, and plied back to
it; and, in the mean time, sent away the master in a boat to sound the coast. He returned about <time>five
o'clock in the evening</time>; and soon after we came to an anchor in thirty-six fathoms water, before the
sandy beach above mentioned. As the master drew near the shore with the boat, one of the natives
swam off to her, and insisted on coming a-board the ship, where he remained two nights and a day.
The first thing he did after coming a-board, was to measure the length of the ship, by fathoming her
from the tafferel to the stern, and as he counted the fathoms, we observed that he called the
numbers by the same names that they do at Otaheite; nevertheless his language was in a manner wholly
unintelligible to all of us.</p><p>Having anchored too near the edge of a bank, a fresh breeze from the land, about <time>three o'clock</time>
the next morning, drove us off it; on which the anchor was heaved up, and sail made to regain the
bank again. While the ship was plying in, I went ashore, accompanied by some of the gentlemen, to
see what the island was likely to afford us. We landed at the sandy beach, where some hundreds of
the natives were assembled, and who were so impatient to see us, that many of them swam off to meet
the boats. Not one of them had so much as a stick or weapon of any sort in their hands. After
distributing a few trinkets amongst them, we made signs for something to eat, on which they brought
down a few potatoes, plantains, and sugar canes, and exchanged them for nails, looking-glasses, and
pieces of cloth.</p><p>We presently discovered that they were as expert thieves and as tricking in their exchanges, as
any people we had yet met with. It was with some difficulty we could keep the hats on our heads; but
hardly possible to keep any thing in our pockets, not even what themselves had sold us; for they
would watch every opportunity to snatch it from us, so that we sometimes bought the same thing two
or three times over, and after all did not get it.</p><p>Before I sailed from England, I was informed that a Spanish ship had visited this isle in 1769.
Some signs of it were seen among the people now about us; one man had a pretty good broad-brimmed
European hat on, another had a grego jacket, and another a red silk handkerchief. They also seemed
to know the use of a musquet, and to stand in much awe of it; but this they probably learnt from
Roggewein, who, if we are to believe the authors of that voyage, left them sufficient tokens.</p><p>Near the place where we landed, were some of those statues before mentioned, which I shall
describe in another place. The country appeared barren and without wood; there were, nevertheless,
several plantations of potatoes, plantains, and sugar-canes; we also saw some fowls, and found a
well of brackish water. As these were articles we were in want of, and as the natives seemed not
unwilling to part with them, I resolved to stay a day or two. With this view I repaired on board,
and brought the ship to an anchor in thirty-two fathoms water; the bottom a fine dark sand. Our
station was about a mile from the nearest shore, the south point of a small bay, in the bottom of
which is the sandy beach before mentioned, being E.S.E., distant one mile and a-half. The two rocky
islets lying off the south point of the island, were just shut behind a point to the north of them;
they bore south 3/4 west, four miles distant; and the other extreme of the island bore north <geo select="lon">25° E</geo>.,
distant about six miles. But the best mark for this anchoring-place is the beach, because it is the
only one on this side of the island. In the <time>afternoon</time>, we got on board a few casks of water, and
opened a trade with the natives for such things as they had to dispose of. Some of the gentlemen
also made an excursion into the country to see what it produced; and returned again in the evening,
with the loss only of a hat, which one of the natives snatched off the head of one of the party.</p><p>Early next morning, I sent Lieutenants Pickersgill and Edgecumbe with a party of men, accompanied
by several of the gentlemen, to examine the country. As I was not sufficiently recovered from my
late illness to make one of the party, I was obliged to content myself with remaining at the
landing-place among the natives. We had, at one time, a pretty brisk trade with them for potatoes,
which we observed they dug up out of an adjoining plantation; but this traffic, which was very
advantageous to us, was soon put a stop to by the owner (as we supposed) of the plantation coming
down, and driving all the people out of it. By this we concluded, that he had been robbed of his
property, and that they were not less scrupulous of stealing from one another, than from us, on whom
they practised every little fraud they could think of, and generally with success; for we no sooner
detected them in one, than they found out another. About <time>seven o'clock  in the evening</time>, the party I
had sent into the country returned, after having been over the greatest part of the island.</p><p>They left the beach about <time>nine o'clock  in the morning</time>, and took a path which led across to the
S.E. side of the island, followed by a great crowd of the natives, who pressed much upon them. But
they had not proceeded far, before a middle-aged man, punctured from head to foot, and his face
painted with a sort of white pigment, appeared with a spear in his hand, and walked along-side of
them, making signs to his countrymen to keep at a distance, and not to molest our people. When he
had pretty well effected this, he hoisted a piece of white cloth on his spear, placed himself in the
front, and led the way, with his ensign of peace, as they understood it to be. For the greatest part
of the distance across, the ground had but a barren appearance, being a dry hard clay, and every
where covered with stones; but notwithstanding this, there were several large tracts planted with
potatoes; and some plantain walks, but they saw no fruit on any of the trees. Towards the highest
part of the south end of the island, the soil, which was a fine red earth, seemed much better, bore
a longer grass, and was not covered with stones as in the other parts; but here they saw neither
house nor plantation.</p><p>On the east side, near the sea, they met with three platforms of stone- work, or rather the ruins
of them. On each had stood four of those large statues, but they were all fallen down from two of
them, and also one from the third; all except one were broken by the fall, or in some measure
defaced. Mr Wales measured this one, and found it to be fifteen feet in length, and six feet broad
over the shoulders, Each statue had on its head a large cylindric stone of a red colour, wrought
perfectly round. The one they measured, which was not by far the largest, was fifty-two inches high,
and sixty-six in diameter. In some, the upper corner of the cylinder was taken off in a sort of
concave quarter-round, but in others the cylinder was entire.</p><p>From this place they followed the direction of the coast to the N.E., the man with the flag still
leading the way. For about three miles they found the country very barren, and in some places stript
of the soil to the bare rock, which seemed to be a poor sort of iron ore. Beyond this, they came to
the most fertile part of the island they saw, it being interspersed with plantations of potatoes,
sugar-canes, and plantain trees, and these not so much encumbered with stones as those which they
had seen before; but they could find no water except what the natives twice or thrice brought them,
which, though brackish and stinking, was rendered acceptable, by the extremity of their thirst. They
also passed some huts, the owners of which met them with roasted potatoes and sugar-canes, and,
placing themselves a- head of the foremost party (for they marched in a line in order to have the
benefit of the path), gave one to each man as he passed by. They observed the same method in
distributing the water which they brought; and were particularly careful that the foremost did not
drink too much, lest none should be left for the hindmost. But at the very time these were relieving
the thirsty and hungry, there were not wanting others who endeavoured to steal from them the very
things which had been given them. At last, to prevent worse consequences, they were obliged to fire
a load of small shot at one who was so audacious as to snatch from one of the men the bag which
contained every thing they carried with them. The shot hit him on the back, on which he dropped the
bag, ran a little way, and then fell; but he afterwards got up and walked, and what became of him
they knew not, nor whether he was much wounded. As this affair occasioned some delay, and drew the
natives together, they presently saw the man who had hitherto led the way and one or two more,
coming running towards them; but instead of stopping when they came up, they continued to run round
them, repeating, in a kind manner, a few words, until our people set forwards again. Then their old
guide hoisted his flag, leading the way as before, and none ever attempted to steal from them the
whole day afterwards. As they passed along, they observed on a hill a number of people collected
together, some of whom had spears in their hands; but on their being called to by their countrymen,
they dispersed, except a few, amongst whom was one seemingly of some note. He was a stout well-made
man, with a fine open countenance, his face was painted, his body punctured, and he wore a better
<emph rend="italic">Ha hou</emph>, or cloth, than the rest. He saluted them as he came up, by
stretching out his arms, with both hands clenched, lifting them over his head, opening them wide,
and then letting them fall gradually down to his sides. To this man, whom they understood to be
chief of the island, their other friend gave his white flag, and he gave him another, who carried it
before them the remainder of the day.</p><p>Towards the eastern end of the island, they met with a well whose water was perfectly fresh,
being considerably above the level of the sea; but it was dirty, owing to the filthiness or
cleanliness (call it which you will) of the natives, who never go to drink without washing
themselves all over as soon as they have done; and if ever so many of them are together, the first
leaps right into the middle of the hole, drinks, and washes himself without the least ceremony;
after which another takes his place and does the same.</p><p>They observed that this side of the island was full of those gigantic statues so often mentioned;
some placed in groupes on platforms of masonry, others single, fixed only in the earth, and that not
deep; and these latter are, in general, much larger than the others. Having measured one, which had
fallen down, they found it very near twenty-seven feet long, and upwards of eight feet over the
breast or shoulders; and yet this appeared considerably short of the size of one they saw standing;
its shade, a little past <time>two o'clock</time>, being sufficient to shelter all the party, consisting of near
thirty persons, from the rays of the sun. Here they stopped to dine; after which they repaired to a
hill, from whence they saw all the east and north shores of the isle, on which they could not see
either bay or creek fit even for a boat to land in; nor the least signs of fresh water. What the
natives brought them here was real salt water; but they observed that some of them drank pretty
plentifully of it, so far will necessity and custom get the better of nature! On this account they
were obliged to return to the last-mentioned well, where, after having quenched their thirst, they
directed their route across the island towards the ship, as it was now <time>four o'clock</time>.</p><p>In a small hollow, on the highest part of the island, they met with several such cylinders as are
placed on the heads of the statues. Some of these appeared larger than any they had seen before; but
it was now too late to stop to measure any of them. Mr Wales, from whom I had this information, is
of opinion that there had been a quarry here, whence these stones had formerly been dug; and that it
would have been no difficult matter to roll them down the hill after they were formed. I think this
a very reasonable conjecture, and have no doubt that it has been so.</p><p>On the declivity of the mountain towards the west, they met with another well, but the water was
a very strong mineral, had a thick green scum on the top, and stunk intolerably. Necessity, however,
obliged some to drink of it; but it soon made them so sick, that they threw it up the same way that
it went down.</p><p>In all this excursion, as well as the one made the preceding day, only two or three shrubs were
seen. The leaf and seed of one (called by the natives <emph rend="italic">Torromedo</emph>) were not
much unlike those of the common vetch; but the pod was more like that of a tamarind in its size and
shape. The seeds have a disagreeable bitter taste; and the natives, when they saw our people chew
them, made signs to spit them out; from whence it was concluded that they think them poisonous. The
wood is of a reddish colour, and pretty hard and heavy, but very crooked, small, and short, not
exceeding six or seven feet in height. At the S.W. corner of the island, they found another small
shrub, whose wood was white and brittle, and in some measure, as also its leaf, resembling the ash.
They also saw in several places the Otaheitean cloth plant, but it was poor and weak, and not above
two and a half feet high at most.</p><p>They saw not an animal of any sort, and but very few birds; nor indeed any thing which can induce
ships that are not in the utmost distress, to touch at this island.</p><p>This account of the excursion I had from Mr Pickersgill and Mr Wales, men on whose veracity I
could depend; and therefore I determined to leave the island the next morning, since nothing was to
be obtained that could make it worth my while to stay longer; for the water which we had sent on
board, was not much better than if it had been taken up out of the sea.</p><p>We had a calm till <time>ten o'clock  in the morning</time> of the 16th, when a breeze sprung up at west,
accompanied with heavy showers of rain, which lasted about an hour. The weather then clearing up, we
got under sail, stood to sea, and kept plying to and fro, while an officer was sent on shore with
two boats, to purchase such refreshments as the natives might have brought down; for I judged this
would be the case, as they knew nothing of our sailing. The event proved that I was not mistaken;
for the boats made two trips before night, when we hoisted them in, and made sail to the N.W., with
a light breeze at N.N.E.</p></div><div type="chapter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N"><head><l>CHAPTER VIII.</l><l><emph rend="italic">A Description of the Island, and its Produce, Situation, and Inhabitants; their
Manners and Customs; Conjectures concerning their Government, Religion, and other Subjects; with a
more particular Account of the gigantic Statues.</emph></l></head><p><date>1774 March</date></p><p>I shall now give some farther account of this island, which is undoubtedly the same that Admiral
Roggewein touched at in <date>April 1722</date>; although the description given of it by the authors of that
voyage does by no means agree with it now. It may also be the same that was seen by Captain Davis in
1686; for, when seen from the east, it answers very well to Wafer's description, as I have before
observed. In short, if this is not the land, his discovery cannot lie far from the coast of America,
as this latitude has been well explored from the meridian of 80° to 110°. Captain Carteret carried
it much farther; but his track seems to have been a little too far south. Had I found fresh water, I
intended spending some days in looking for the low sandy isle Davis fell in with, which would have
determined the point. But as I did not find water, and had a long run to make before I was assured
of getting any, and being in want of refreshments, I declined the search; as a small delay might
have been attended with bad consequences to the crew, many of them beginning to be more or less
affected with the scurvy.</p><p>No nation need contend for the honour of the discovery of this island, as there can be few places
which afford less convenience for shipping than it does. Here is no safe anchorage, no wood for
fuel, nor any fresh water worth taking on board. Nature has been exceedingly sparing of her favours
to this spot. As every thing must be raised by dint of labour, it cannot be supposed that the
inhabitants plant much more than is sufficient for themselves; and as they are but few in number,
they cannot have much to spare to supply the wants of visitant strangers. The produce is sweet
potatoes, yams, tara or eddy root, plantains, and sugar-canes, all pretty good, the potatoes
especially, which are the best of the kind I ever tasted. Gourds they have also, but so very few,
that a cocoa-nut shell was the most valuable thing we could give them. They have a few tame fowls,
such as cocks and hens, small but well tasted. They have also rats, which it seems they eat; for I
saw a man with some dead ones in his hand, and he seemed unwilling to part with them, giving me to
understand they were for food. Of land-birds there were hardly any, and sea-birds but few; these
were men-of-war, tropic, and egg-birds, noddies, tern, &amp;c. The coast seemed not to abound with
fish, at least we could catch none with hook and line, and it was but very little we saw among the
natives.</p><p>Such is the produce of Easter Island, or Davis's Land, which is situated in latitude <geo select="lat">27° 5' 30"
S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">109° 46' 20" W</geo>. It is about ten or twelve leagues in circuit, hath a hilly and stony
surface, and an iron-bound shore. The hills are of such a height as to be seen fifteen or sixteen
leagues. Off the south end, are two rocky islets, lying near the shore. The north and east points of
the island rise directly from the sea to a considerable height; between them and the S.E. side, the
shore forms an open bay, in which I believe the Dutch anchored. We anchored, as hath been already
mentioned, on the west side of the island, three miles to the north of the south point, with the
sandy beach bearing E.S.S. This is a very good road with easterly winds, but a dangerous one with
westerly; as the other on the S.E. side must be with easterly winds.</p><p>For this, and other bad accommodations already mentioned, nothing but necessity will induce any
one to touch at this isle, unless it can be done without going much out of the way; in which case,
touching here may be advantageous, as the people willingly and readily part with such refreshments
as they have, and at an easy rate. We certainly received great benefit from the little we got; but
few ships can come here without being in want of water, and this want cannot be here supplied. The
little we took on board, could not be made use of, it being only salt water which had filtered
through a stony beach into a stone well; this the natives had made for the purpose, a little to the
southward of the sandy beach so often mentioned, and the water ebbed and flowed into it with the
tide.</p><p>The inhabitants of this island do not seem to exceed six or seven hundred souls, and above
two-thirds of those we saw were males. They either have but few females amongst them, or else many
were restrained from making their appearance during our stay, for though we saw nothing to induce us
to believe the men were of a jealous disposition, or the women afraid to appear in public, something
of this kind was probably the case.</p><p>In colour, features, and language, they bear such an affinity to the people of the more western
isles, that no one will doubt they have had the same origin. It is extraordinary that the same
nation should have spread themselves over all the isles in this vast ocean, from New Zealand to this
island, which is almost one-fourth part of the circumference of the globe. Many of them have now no
other knowledge of each other, than what is preserved by antiquated tradition; and they have, by
length of time, become, as it were, different nations, each having adopted some peculiar custom or
habit, &amp;c. Nevertheless, a careful observer will soon see the affinity each has to the other. In
general, the people of this isle are a slender race. I did not see a man that would measure six
feet; so far are they from being giants, as one of the authors of Roggewein's voyage asserts. They
are brisk and active, have good features, and not disagreeable countenances; are friendly and
hospitable to strangers, but as much addicted to pilfering as any of their neighbours.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Tattowing</emph>, or puncturing the skin, is much used here. The men are marked
from head to foot, with figures all nearly alike; only some give them one direction, and some
another, as fancy leads. The women are but little punctured; red and white paint is an ornament with
<emph rend="italic">them</emph>, as also with the men; the former is made of turmeric, but what
composes the latter I know not.</p><p>Their clothing is a piece or two of quilted cloth, about six feet by four, or a mat. One piece
wrapped round their loins, and another over their shoulders, make a complete dress. But the men, for
the most part, are in a manner naked, wearing nothing but a slip of cloth betwixt their legs, each
end of which is fastened to a cord or belt they wear round the waist. Their cloth is made of the
same materials as at Otaheite, viz. of the bark of the cloth-plant; but, as they have but little of
it, our Otaheitean cloth, or indeed any sort of it, came here to a good market.</p><p>Their hair in general is black; the women wear it long, and sometimes tied up on the crown of the
head; but the men wear it, and their beards, cropped short. Their headdress is a round fillet
adorned with feathers, and a straw bonnet something like a Scotch one; the former, I believe, being
chiefly worn by the men, and the latter by the women. Both men and women have very large holes, or
rather slits, in their ears, extending to near three inches in length. They sometimes turn this slit
over the upper part, and then the ear looks as if the flap was cut off. The chief ear-ornaments are
the white down of feathers, and rings, which they wear in the inside of the hole, made of some
elastic substance, rolled up like a watch-spring. I judged this was to keep the hole at its utmost
extension. I do not remember seeing them wear any other ornaments, excepting amulets made of bone or
shells.</p><p>As harmless and friendly as these people seemed to be, they are not without offensive weapons,
such as short wooden clubs and spears; the latter of which are crooked sticks about six feet long,
armed at one end with pieces of flint. They have also a weapon made of wood, like the <emph rend="italic">Patoo patoo</emph> of New Zealand.</p><p>Their houses are low miserable huts, constructed by setting sticks upright in the ground, at six
or eight feet distance, then bending them towards each other, and tying them together at the top,
forming thereby a kind of Gothic arch. The longest sticks are placed in the middle, and shorter ones
each way, and a less distance asunder, by which means the building is highest and broadest in the
middle, and lower and narrower towards each end. To these are tied others horizontally, and the
whole is thatched over with leaves of sugar-cane. The door-way is in the middle of one side, formed
like a porch, and so low and narrow, as just to admit a man to enter upon all fours. The largest
house I saw was about sixty feet long, eight or nine feet high in the middle, and three or four at
each end; its breadth, at these parts, was nearly equal to its height. Some have a kind of vaulted
houses built with stone, and partly under ground; but I never was in one of these.</p><p>I saw no household utensils among them, except gourds, and of these but very few. They were
extravagantly fond of cocoa-nut shells, more so than of any thing we could give them. They dress
their victuals in the same manner as at Otaheite; that is, with hot stones in an oven or hole in the
ground. The straw or tops of sugar-cane, plantain heads, &amp;c. serve them for fuel to heat the
stones. Plantains, which require but little dressing, they roast under fires of straw, dried grass,
&amp;c. and whole races of them are ripened or roasted in this manner. We frequently saw ten or a
dozen, or more, such fires in one place, and most commonly in the mornings and evenings.</p><p>Not more than three or four canoes were seen on the whole island, and these very mean, and built
of many pieces sewed together with small line. They are about eighteen or twenty feet long, head and
stem carved or raised a little, are very narrow, and fitted with out-riggers. They do not seem
capable of carrying above four persons, and are by no means fit for any distant navigation. As small
and mean as these canoes were, it was a matter of wonder to us, where they got the wood to build
them with; for in one of them was a board six or eight feet long, fourteen inches broad at one end,
and eight at the other; whereas we did not see a stick on the island that would have made a board
half this size, nor, indeed, was there another piece in the whole canoe half so big.</p><p>There are two ways by which it is possible they may have got this large wood; it might have been
left here by the Spaniards, or it might have been driven on the shore of the island from some
distant land. It is even possible that there may be some land in the neighbourhood, from whence they
might have got it. We, however, saw no signs of any, nor could we get the least information on this
head from the natives, although we tried every method we could think of to obtain it. We were almost
as unfortunate in our enquiries for the proper or native name of the island; for, on comparing
notes, I found we had got three different names for it, viz. Tamareki, Whyhu, and Teapy. Without
pretending to say which, or whether any of them is right, I shall only observe, that the last was
obtained by Oedidee, who understood their language much better than any of us, though even he
understood it but very imperfectly.</p><p>It appears by the account of Roggewein's voyage, that these people had no better vessels than
when he first visited them. The want of materials, and not of genius, seems to be the reason why
they have made no improvement in this art. Some pieces of carving were found amongst them, both well
designed and executed. Their plantations are prettily laid out by line, but not inclosed by any
fence; indeed they have nothing for this purpose but stones.</p><p>I have no doubt that all these plantations are private property, and that there are here, as at
Otaheite, chiefs (which they call <emph rend="italic">Areekes</emph>) to whom these plantations
belong. But of the power or authority of these chiefs, or of the government of these people, I
confess myself quite ignorant.</p><p>Nor are we better acquainted with their religion. The gigantic statues, so often mentioned, are
not, in my opinion, looked upon as idols by the present inhabitants, whatever they might have been
in the days of the Dutch; at least I saw nothing that could induce me to think so. On the contrary,
I rather suppose that they are burying-places for certain tribes or families. I, as well as some
others, saw a human skeleton lying in one of the platforms, just covered with stones. Some of these
platforms of masonry are thirty or forty feet long, twelve or sixteen broad, and from three to
twelve in height; which last in some measure depends on the nature of the ground; for they are
generally at the brink of the bank facing the sea, so that this face may be ten or twelve feet or
more high, and the other may not be above three or four. They are built, or rather faced, with hewn
stones, of a very large size; and the workmanship is not inferior to the best plain piece of masonry
we have in England. They use no sort of cement, yet the joints are exceedingly close, and the stones
morticed and tenanted one into another, in a very artful manner. The side-walls are not
perpendicular, but inclining a little inwards, in the same manner that breast-works, &amp;c. are
built in Europe; yet had not all this care, pains, and sagacity, been able to preserve these curious
structures from the ravages of all-devouring time.</p><p>The statues, or at least many of them, are erected on these platforms, which serve as
foundations. They are, as near as we could judge, about half length, ending in a sort of stump at
the bottom, on which they stand. The workmanship is rude, but not bad; nor are the features of the
face ill formed, the nose and chin in particular; but the ears are long beyond proportion; and, as
to the bodies, there is hardly any thing like a human figure about them.</p><p>I had an opportunity of examining only two or three of these statues, which are near the
landing-place; and they were of a grey stone, seemingly of the same sort as that with which the
platforms were built. But some of the gentlemen, who travelled over the island, and examined many of
them, were of opinion that the stone of which they were made, was different from any they saw on the
island, and had much the appearance of being factitious. We could hardly conceive how these
islanders, wholly unacquainted with any mechanical power, could raise such stupendous figures, and
afterwards place the large cylindric stones before mentioned upon their heads. The only method I can
conceive, is by raising the upper end by little and little, supporting it by stones as it is raised,
and building about it till they got it erect; thus a sort of mount or scaffolding would be made,
upon which they might roll the cylinder, and place it upon the head of the statue, and then the
stones might be removed from about it. But if the stones are factitious, the statues might have been
put together on the place, in their present position, and the cylinder put on by building a mount
round them, as above mentioned. But, let them have been made and set up by this or any other method,
they must have been a work of immense time, and sufficiently shew the ingenuity and perseverance of
these islanders in the age in which they were built; for the present inhabitants have most certainly
had no hand in them, as they do not even repair the foundations of those which are going to decay.
They give different names to them, such as Gotomoara, Marapate, Kanaro, Goway-too-goo, Matta Matta,
&amp;c. &amp;c. to which they sometimes prefix the word Moi, and sometimes annex Areeke. The latter
signifies chief, and the former burying, or sleeping-place, as well as we could understand.</p><p>Besides the monuments of antiquity, which were pretty numerous, and no where but on or near the
sea-coast, there were many little heaps of stones, piled up in different places along the coast. Two
or three of the uppermost stones in each pile were generally white, perhaps always so, when the pile
is complete. It will hardly be doubted that these piles of stone had a meaning; probably they might
mark the place where people had been buried, and serve instead of the large statues.</p><p>The working-tools of these people are but very mean, and, like those of all the other islanders
we have visited in this ocean, made of stone, bone, shells, &amp;c. They set but little value on
iron or iron tools, which is the more extraordinary, as they know their use; but the reason may be,
their having but little occasion for them.</p></div><div type="chapter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N"><head><l>CHAPTER IX.</l><l><emph rend="italic">The Passage from Easter Island to the Marquesas Islands. Transactions and
Incidents which happened while the Ship lay in Madre de Dios, or Resolution Bay, in the Island of St
Christina.</emph></l></head><p><date>1774 March</date></p><p>After leaving Easter Island, I steered N.W. by N. and N.N.W., with a fine easterly gale,
intending to touch at the Marquesas, if I met with nothing before I got there. We had not been long
at sea, before the bilious disorder made another attack upon me, but not so violent as the former. I
believe this second visit was owing to exposing and fatiguing myself too much at Easter Island.</p><p>On the 22d, being in the latitude of <geo select="lat">19° 20' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">114° 49' W</geo>., steered N.W. Since
leaving Easter Island, the variation had not been more than 3° 4', nor less than <geo select="lon">2° 32' E</geo>.; but on
the 26th, at six a.m., in latitude <geo select="lat" n="1">15° 7' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">119° 45' W</geo>., it was no more than <geo select="lon">1° 1' E</geo>.;
after which it began to increase.</p><p>On the 29th, being in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="1">10° 20' S</geo> , longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">123° 58' W</geo>., altered the course to
W.N.W., and the next day to west, being then in latitude <geo select="lat">9° 24' S</geo>, which I judged to be the parallel
of Marquesas; where, as I have before observed, I intended to touch, in order to settle their
situation, which I find different in different charts. Having now a steady settled trade-wind, and
pleasant weather, I ordered the forge to be set up, to repair and make various necessary articles in
the iron way; and the caulkers had already been some time at work caulking the decks, weather-
works, &amp;c.</p><p><date>1774 April</date></p><p>As we advanced to the west, we found the variation to increase but slowly; for, on the 3d of
April, it was only <geo select="lon">4° 40' E</geo>., being then in the latitude of <geo select="lat">9° 32' S</geo> , longitude <geo select="lon">132° 45' W</geo>, by
observation made at the same time.</p><p>I continued to steer to the west till the 6th, at four in the <time>afternoon</time>, at which time, being in
the latitude of <geo select="lat">9° 20' S</geo> , longitude <geo select="lon">138° 14' W</geo>., we discovered an island, bearing west by south,
distant about nine leagues. Two hours after we saw another, bearing S.W. by S., which appeared more
extensive than the former. I hauled up for this island, and ran under an easy sail all night, having
squally unsettled rainy weather, which is not very uncommon in this sea, when near high land. At six
o'clock the next morning, the first island bore N.W., the second S.W. 1/2 W., and a third W. I gave
orders to steer for the separation between the two last; and soon after, a fourth was seen, still
more to the west. By this time, we were well assured that these were the Marquesas, discovered by
Mendana in 1595. The first isle was a new discovery, which I named Hood's Island, after the young
gentleman who first saw it, the second was that of Saint Pedro, the third La Dominica, and the
fourth St Christina. We ranged the S.E..coast of La Dominica, without seeing the least signs of
anchorage, till we came to the channel that divides it from St Christina, through which we passed,
hauled over for the last-mentioned island, and ran along the coast to the S.W. in search of
Mendana's Port. We passed several coves in which there seemed to be anchorage; but a great surf
broke on all the shores. Some canoes put off from these places, and followed us down the coast.</p><p>At length, having come before the port we were in search of, we attempted to turn into it, the
wind being right out; but as it blew in violent squalls from this high land, one of these took us
just after we had put in stays, payed the ship off again, and before she wore round, she was within
a few yards of being driven against the rocks to leeward. This obliged us to stand out to sea, and
to make a stretch to windward; after which we stood in again, and without attempting to turn,
anchored in the entrance of the bay in thirty-four fathoms water, a fine sandy bottom. This was no
sooner done, than about thirty or forty of the natives came off to us in ten or twelve canoes; but
it required some address to get them alongside. At last a hatchet, and some spike-nails, induced the
people in one canoe to come under the quarter-gallery; after which, all the others put alongside,
and having exchanged some breadfruit and fish for small nails, &amp;c. retired ashore, the sun being
already set. We observed a heap of stones on the bow of each canoe, and every man to have a sling
tied round his hand.</p><p>Very early next morning, the natives visited us again in much greater numbers than before;
bringing with them bread-fruit, plantains, and one pig, all of which they exchanged for nails,
&amp;c. But in this traffic they would frequently keep our goods, and make no return, till at last I
was obliged to fire a musket-ball over one man who had several times served us in this manner; after
which they dealt more fairly; and soon after several of them came on board. At this time we were
preparing to warp farther into the bay, and I was going in a boat, to look for the most convenient
place to moor the ship in. Observing too many of the natives on board, I said to the officers, "You
must look well after these people, or they will certainly carry off something or other." I had
hardly got into the boat, before I was told they had stolen one of the iron stanchions from the
opposite gang-way, and were making off with it. I ordered them to fire over the canoe till I could
get round in the boat, but not to kill any one. But the natives made too much noise for me to be
heard, and the unhappy thief was killed at the third shot. Two others in the same canoe leaped
overboard, but got in again just as I came to them. The stanchion they had thrown over board. One of
them, a man grown, sat bailing the blood and water out of the canoe, in a kind of hysteric laugh;
the other, a youth about fourteen or fifteen years of age, looked on the deceased with a serious and
dejected countenance; we had afterwards reason to believe he was his son.</p><p>At this unhappy accident, all the natives retired with precipitation. I followed them into the
bay, and prevailed upon the people in one canoe to come alongside the boat, and receive some nails,
and other things, which I gave them; this in some measure allayed their fears. Having taken a view
of the bay, and found that fresh water, which we most wanted, was to be had, I returned on board,
and carried out a kedge-anchor with three hawsers upon an end, to warp the ship in by, and hove
short on the bower. One would have thought that the natives, by this time, would have been so
sensible of the effect of our fire-arms, as not to have provoked us to fire upon them any more, but
the event proved otherwise; for the boat had no sooner left the kedge-anchor, than two men in a
canoe put off from the shore, took hold of the buoy rope, and attempted to drag it ashore, little
considering what was fast to it. Lest, after discovering their mistake, they should take away the
buoy, I ordered a musket to be fired at them; the ball fell short, and they took not the least
notice of it; but a second having passed over them, they let go the buoy, and made for the shore.
This was the last shot we had occasion to fire at any of them, while we lay at this place. It
probably had more effect than killing the man, by shewing them that they were not safe at any
distance; at least we had reason to think so, for they afterwards stood in great dread of the
musket. Nevertheless, they would very often be exercising their talent of thieving upon us, which I
thought proper to put up with, as our stay was not likely to be long amongst them. The trouble these
people gave us retarded us so long, that, before we were ready to heave the anchor, the wind began
to increase, and blew in squalls out of the bay, so that we were obliged to lie fast. It was not
long before the natives ventured off to us again. In the first canoe which came, was a man who
seemed to be of some consequence; he advanced slowly, with a pig on his shoulder, and speaking
something which we did not understand. As soon as he got alongside, I made him a present of a
hatchet and several other articles: In return, he sent in his pig; and was at last prevailed upon to
come himself up to the gang-way, where he made but a short stay. The reception this man met with,
induced the people in all the other canoes to put alongside; and exchanges were presently
reestablished.</p><p>Matters being thus settled on board, I went on shore with a party of men, to see what was to be
done there. We were received by the natives with great courtesy; and, as if nothing had happened,
trafficked with them for some fruit and a few small pigs; and after loading the launch with water,
returned aboard. After dinner I sent the boats ashore for water, under the protection of a guard; on
their landing, the natives all fled but one man, and he seemed much frightened; afterwards one or
two more came down, and these were all that were seen this <time>afternoon</time>. We could not conceive the
reason of this sudden fright.</p><p>Early in the morning of the 9th, the boats were sent as usual for water; and just as they were
coming off, but not before, some of the natives made their appearance. After breakfast I landed some
little time before the guard, when the natives crowded round me in great numbers; but as soon as the
guard landed, I had enough to do to keep them from running off: At length their fears vanished, and
a trade was opened for fruit and pigs. I believe the reason of the natives flying from our people
the day before, was their not seeing me at the head of them; for they certainly would have done the
same to-day, had I not been present. About <time>noon</time>, a chief of some consequence, attended by a great
number of people, came down to the landing-place. I presented him with such articles as I had with
me, and, in return, he gave me some of his ornaments. After these mutual exchanges, a good
understanding seemed to be established between us; so that we got by exchanges as much fruit as
loaded two boats, with which we returned on board to dinner; but could not prevail on the chief to
accompany us.</p><p>In the <time>afternoon</time>, the watering and trading parties were sent on shore, though the latter got but
little, as most of the natives had retired into the country. A party of us went to the other, or
southern cove of the bay, where I procured five pigs, and came to the house which, we were told, did
belong to the man we had killed. He must have been a person of some note, as there were six pigs in
and about his house, which we were told belonged to his son, who fled on our approach. I wanted much
to have seen him, to make him a present, and, by other kind treatment, to convince him and the
others that it was not from any bad design against the nation, that we had killed his father. It
would have been to little purpose if I had left any thing in the house, as it certainly would have
been taken by others; especially as I could not sufficiently explain to them my meaning. Strict
honesty was seldom observed when the property of our things came to be disputed. I saw a striking
instance of this in the morning, when I was going ashore. A man in a canoe offered me a small pig
for a six-inch spike, and another man being employed to convey it, I gave him the spike, which he
kept for himself, and instead of it, gave to the man who owned the pig a sixpenny nail. Words of
course arose, and I waited to see how it would end; but as the man who had possession of the spike
seemed resolved to keep it, I left them before it was decided. In the evening we returned on board
with what refreshments we had collected, and thought we had made a good day's work.</p><p>On the 10th, early in the morning, some people from more distant parts came in canoes alongside,
and sold us some pigs; so that we had now sufficient to give the crew a fresh meal. They were, in
general, so small, that forty or fifty were hardly sufficient for this purpose. The trade on shore
for fruit was as brisk as ever. After dinner, I made a little expedition in my boat along the coast
to the south-ward, accompanied by some of the gentlemen: At the different places we touched at, we
collected eighteen pigs; and I believe, might have got more. The people were exceedingly obliging
wherever we landed, and readily brought down whatever we desired.</p><p>Next morning I went down to the same place where we had been the preceding evening; but instead
of getting pigs, as I expected, found the scene quite changed. The nails and other things they were
mad after but the evening before, they now despised, and instead of them wanted they did not know
what; so that I was obliged to return, with three or four little pigs, which cost more than a dozen
did the day before. When I got on board, I found the same change had happened there, as also at the
trading place on shore. The reason was, several of the young gentlemen having landed the preceding
day, had given away in exchange various articles which the people had not seen before, and which
took with them more than nails or more useful iron tools. But what ruined our market the most, was
one of them giving for a pig a very large quantity of red feathers he had got at Amsterdam. None of
us knew at this time, that this article was in such estimation here; and, if I had known it, I could
not have supported the trade, in the manner it was begun, one day. Thus was our fine prospect of
getting a plentiful supply of refreshments from these people frustrated; which will ever be the case
so long as every one is allowed to make exchanges for what he pleases, and in what manner be
pleases. When I found this island was not likely to supply us, on any conditions, with sufficient
refreshments, such as we might expect to find at the Society Isles, nor very convenient for taking
in wood and water, nor for giving the ship the necessary repairs she wanted, I resolved forthwith to
leave it, and proceed to some other place, where our wants might be effectually relieved. For after
having been nineteen weeks at sea, and living all the time upon salt diet, we could not but want
some refreshments; although I must own, and that with pleasure, that on our arrival here, it could
hardly be said we had one sick man; and but a few who had the least complaint. This was undoubtedly
owing to the many antiscorbutic articles we had on board, and to the great attention of the surgeon,
who was remarkably careful to apply them in time.</p></div><div type="chapter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N"><head><l>CHAPTER X.</l><l><emph rend="italic">Departure from the Marquesas; a Description of the Situation, Extent, Figure,
and Appearance of the several Islands; with some Account of the Inhabitants, their Customs, Dress,
Habitations, Food, Weapons, and Canoes.</emph></l></head><p><date>1774 April</date></p><p>At <time>three o'clock</time> in the <time>afternoon</time>, we weighed, and stood over from St Christina for La Dominica,
in order to take a view of the west side of that isle; but as it was dark before we reached it, the
night was spent in plying between the two isles. The next morning we had a full view of the S.W.
point, from which the coast trended N.E.; so that it was not probable we should find good anchorage
on that side, as being exposed to the easterly winds. We had now but little wind, and that very
variable, with showers of rain. At length we got a breeze at E.N.E. with which we steered to the
south. At <time>five o'clock</time> p.m., Resolution Bay bore E.N.E. 1/2 E. distant five leagues, and the island
Magdalena S.E., about nine leagues distant. This was the only sight we had of this isle. From hence
I steered S.S.W. 1/2 W. for Otaheite, with a view of falling in with some of those isles discovered
by former navigators, especially those discovered by the Dutch, whose situations are not well
determined. But it will be necessary to return to the Marquesas; which were, as I have already
observed, first discovered by Mendana, a Spaniard, and from him obtained the general name they now
bear, as well as those of the different isles. The nautical account of them, in vol. i. p. 61, of
Dalrymple's Collection of Voyages to the South Seas, is deficient in nothing but situation. This was
my chief reason for touching, at them; the settling this point is the more useful, as it will in a
great measure fix the situations of Mendana's other discoveries.</p><p>The Marquesas are five in number, viz. La Magdalena, St Pedro, La Dominica, Santa Christina, and
Hood's Island, which is the northernmost, situated in latitude <geo select="lat">9° 26' S</geo>., and N. 13° W., five
leagues and a half distant from the east point of La Dominica, which is the largest of all the
isles, extending east and west six leagues. It hath an unequal breadth, and is about fifteen or
sixteen leagues in circuit. It is full of rugged hills, rising in ridges directly from the sea;
these ridges are disjoined by deep vallies which are clothed with wood, as are the sides of some of
the hills; the aspect, however, is barren; but it is, nevertheless, inhabited. Latitude 9° 44' 30"
S. St Pedro, which is about three leagues in circuit, and of a good height, lies south, four leagues
and a half from the east end of La Dominica; we know not if it be inhabited. Nature has not been
very bountiful to it. St Christina lies under the same parallel, three or four leagues more to the
west. This island stretches north and south, is nine miles long in that direction, and about seven
leagues in circuit. A narrow ridge of hills of considerable height extends the whole length of the
island. There are other ridges, which, rising from the sea, and with an equal ascent, join the main
ridge. These are disjoined by deep narrow vallies, which are fertile, adorned with fruit and other
trees, and watered by fine streams of excellent water. La Magdalena we only saw at a distance. Its
situation must be nearly in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="1">10° 25' S</geo> , longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">138° 50' W</geo>. So that these isles occupy
one degree in latitude, and near half a degree in longitude, viz. from 138° 47' to 139° 13' W.,
which is the longitude of the west end of La Dominica.</p><p>The port of Madre de Dios, which I named Resolution Bay, is situated near the middle of the west
side of St Christina, and under the highest land in the island, in latitude <geo select="lat">9° 55' 30" S</geo>, longitude
<geo select="lon">139° 8' 40" W</geo>.; and north 15' W. from the west end of La Dominica. The south point of the bay is a
steep rock of considerable height, terminating at the top in a peaked hill, above which you will see
a path-way leading up a narrow ridge to the summits of the hills. The north point is not so high,
and rises with a more gentle slope. They are a mile from each other, in the direction of N. by E.
and S. by W. In the bay, which is near three quarters of a mile deep, and has from thirty-four to
twelve fathoms water, with a clean sandy bottom, are two sandy coves, divided from each other by a
rocky point. In each is a rivulet of excellent water. The northern cove is the most commodious for
wooding and watering. Here is the little water-fall mentioned by Quiros, Mendana's pilot; but the
town, or village, is in the other cove. There are several other coves, or bays, on this side of the
island, and some of them, especially to the northward, may be mistaken for this; therefore, the best
direction is the bearing of the west end of La Dominica.</p><p>The trees, plants, and other productions of these isles, so far as we know, are nearly the same
as at Otaheite and the Society Isles. The refreshments to be got are hogs, fowls, plantains, yams,
and some other roots; likewise bread-fruit and cocoa-nuts, but of these not many. At first these
articles were purchased with nails. Beads, looking-glasses, and such trifles, which are so highly
valued at the Society Isles, are in no esteem here; and even nails at last lost their value for
other articles far less useful.</p><p>The inhabitants of these islands collectively, are, without exception, the finest race of people
in this sea. For fine shape and regular features, they perhaps surpass all other nations.
Nevertheless, the affinity of their language to that spoken in Otaheite and the Society Isles, shews
that they are of the same nation. Oedidee could converse with them tolerably well, though we could
not; but it was easy to see that their language was nearly the same.</p><p>The men are punctured, or curiously <emph rend="italic">tattowed</emph>, from head to foot. The
figures are various, and seem to be directed more by fancy than custom. These puncturations make
them look dark: But the women, who are but little punctured, youths and young children, who are not
at all, are as fair as some Europeans. The men are in general tall, that is, about five feet ten
inches, or six feet; but I saw none that were fat and lusty like the <emph rend="italic">Earees</emph> of Otaheite; nor did I see any that could be called meagre. Their teeth are not so
good, nor are their eyes so full and lively as those of many other nations. Their hair, like ours,
is of many colours, except red, of which I saw none. Some have it long, but the most general custom
is to wear it short, except a bunch on each side of the crown, which they tie in a knot. They
observe different modes in trimming the beard, which is in general long. Some part it, and tie it in
two bunches under the chin, others plait it, some wear it loose, and others quite short.</p><p>Their clothing is the same as at Otaheite, and made of the same materials; but they have it not
in such plenty, nor is it so good. The men, for the most part, have nothing to cover their
nakedness, except the <emph rend="italic">Marra</emph>, as it is called at Otaheite; which is a slip
of cloth passed round the waist and betwixt the legs; This simple dress is quite sufficient for the
climate, and answers every purpose modesty requires. The dress of the women is a piece of cloth
wrapped round the loins like a petticoat, which reaches down below the middle of the leg, and a
loose mantle over their shoulders. Their principal head-dress, and what appears to be their chief
ornament, is a sort of broad fillet, curiously made of the fibres of the husk of cocoa- nuts. In the
front is fixed a mother-o'-pearl shell wrought round to the size of a tea saucer. Before that is
another smaller one, of very fine tortoise-shell, perforated into curious figures. Also before, and
in the centre of that, is another round piece of mother-o'-pearl, about the size of half-a-crown;
and before this another piece of perforated tortoise- shell, about the size of a shilling. Besides
this decoration in front, some have it also on each side, but in smaller pieces; and all have fixed
to them, the tail feathers of cocks, or tropic birds, which, when the fillet is tied on, stand
upright; so that the whole together makes a very sightly ornament. They wear round the neck a kind
of ruff or necklace, call it which you please, made of light wood, the out and upper side covered
with small red pease, which are fixed on with gum. They also wear small bunches of human hair,
fastened to a string, and tied round the legs and arms. Sometimes, instead of hair, they make use of
short feathers; but all the above-mentioned ornaments are seldom seen on the same person.</p><p>I saw only the chief, who came to visit us, completely dressed in this manner. Their ordinary
ornaments are necklaces and amulets made of shells, &amp;c. I did not see any with ear-rings; and
yet all of them had their ears pierced.</p><p>Their dwellings are in the vallies, and on the sides of the hills, near their plantations. They
are built after the same manner as at Otaheite; but are much meaner, and only covered with the
leaves of the bread-tree. The most of them are built on a square or oblong pavement of stone, raised
some height above the level of the ground. They likewise have such pavements near their houses, on
which they sit to eat and amuse themselves.</p><p>In the article of eating, these people are by no means so cleanly as the Otaheiteans. They are
likewise dirty in their cookery. Pork and fowls are dressed in an oven of hot stones, as at
Otaheite; but fruit and roots they roast on the fire, and after taking off the rind or skin, put
them into a platter or trough, with water, out of which I have seen both men and hogs eat at the
same time. I once saw them make a batter of fruit and roots diluted with water, in a vessel that was
loaded with dirt, and out of which the hogs had been but that moment eating, without giving it the
least washing, or even washing their hands, which were equally dirty; and when I expressed a
dislike, was laughed at. I know not if all are so. The actions of a few individuals are not
sufficient to fix a custom on a whole nation. Nor can I say if it is the custom for men and women to
have separate messes. I saw nothing to the contrary: Indeed I saw but few women upon the whole.</p><p>They seemed to have dwellings, or strong-holds, on the summits of the highest hills. These we
only saw by the help of our glasses; for I did not permit any of our people to go there, as we were
not sufficiently acquainted with the disposition of the natives, which (I believe) is humane and
pacific.</p><p>Their weapons are clubs and spears, resembling those of Otaheite, but somewhat neater. They have
also slings, with which they throw stones with great velocity, and to a great distance, but not with
a good aim.</p><p>Their canoes are made of wood, and pieces of the bark of a soft tree, which grows near the sea in
great plenty, and is very tough and proper for the purpose. They are from sixteen to twenty feet
long, and about fifteen inches broad; the head and stern are made of two solid pieces of wood; the
stern rises or curves a little, but in an irregular direction, and ends in a point; the head
projects out horizontally, and is carved into some faint and very rude resemblance of a human face.
They are rowed by paddles, and some have a sort of lateen sail, made of matting.</p><p>Hogs were the only quadrupeds we saw; and cocks and hens the only tame fowls. However, the woods
seemed to abound with small birds of a very beautiful plumage, and fine notes; but the fear of
alarming the natives hindered us from shooting so many of them as might otherwise have been
done.</p></div><div type="chapter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N"><head><l>CHAPTER XI.</l><l><emph rend="italic">A Description of several Islands discovered, or seen in the Passage from the
Marquesas to Otaheite; with an Account of a Naval Review.</emph></l></head><p><date>1774 April</date></p><p>With a fine easterly wind I steered S.W.—S.W. by W. and W. by S. till the 17th, at <time>ten o'clock</time> in
the morning, when land was seen bearing W. 1/2 N., which, upon a nearer approach, we found to be a
string of low islets connected together by a reef of coral rocks. We ranged the northwest coast, at
the distance of one mile from shore, to three quarters of its length, which in the whole is near
four leagues, when we came to a creek or inlet that seemed to open a communication into the lake in
the middle of the isle. As I wanted to obtain some knowledge of the produce of these half- drowned
isles, we brought-to, hoisted out a boat, and sent the master in to sound; there being no soundings
without.</p><p>As we ran along the coast, the natives appeared in several places armed with long spears and
clubs; and some were got together on one side of the creek. When the master returned he reported
that there was no passage into the lake by the creek, which was fifty fathoms wide at the entrance,
and thirty deep; farther in, thirty wide, and twelve deep; that the bottom was every where rocky,
and the sides bounded by a wall of coral rocks. We were under no necessity to put the ship into such
a place as this; but as the natives had shewn some signs of a friendly disposition, by coming
peaceably to the boat, and taking such things as were given them, I sent two boats well armed
ashore, under the command of Lieutenant Cooper, with a view of having some intercourse with them,
and to give Mr Forster an opportunity of collecting something in his way. We saw our people land
without the least opposition being made by a few natives who were on the shores. Some little time
after, observing forty or fifty more, all armed, coming to join them, we stood close in shore, in
order to be ready to support our people in case of an attack. But nothing of this kind happened; and
soon after our boats returned aboard, when Mr Cooper informed me, that, on his landing, only a few
of the natives met him on the beach, but there were many in the skirts of the woods with spears in
their hands. The presents he made them were received with great coolness, which plainly shewed we
were unwelcome visitors. When their reinforcement arrived he thought proper to embark, as the day
was already far spent, and I had given orders to avoid an attack by all possible means. When his men
got into the boats, some were for pushing them off, others for detaining them; but at last they
suffered them to depart at their leisure. They brought aboard five dogs, which seemed to be in
plenty there. They saw no fruit but cocoa-nuts, of which, they got, by exchanges, two dozen. One of
our people got a dog for a single plantain, which led us to conjecture they had none of this
fruit.</p><p>This island, which is called by the inhabitants Ti-oo-kea, was discovered and visited by
Commodore Byron. It has something of an oval shape, is about ten leagues in circuit, lying in the
direction of E.S.E. and W.N.W., and situated in the latitude of <geo select="lat">14° 27' 30" S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">144° 56'
W</geo>. The inhabitants of this island, and perhaps of all the low ones, are of a much darker colour than
those of the higher islands, and seem to be of a more ferine disposition. This may be owing to their
situation. Nature not having bestowed her favours to these low islands with that profusion she has
done to some of the others, the inhabitants are chiefly beholden to the sea for their subsistence,
consequently are much exposed to the sun and weather; and by that means become more dark in colour,
and more hardy and robust; for there is no doubt of their being of the same nation. Our people
observed that they were stout, well-made men, and had the figure of a fish marked on their bodies; a
very good emblem of their profession.</p><p>On the 18th, at day-break, after having spent the night snaking short boards, we wore down to
another isle we had in sight to the westward, which we reached by <time>eight o'clock</time>, and ranged the S.E.
side at one mile from shore. We found it to be just such another as that we had left, extending N.E.
and S.W. near four leagues, and from five to three miles broad. It lies S.W. by W., two leagues
distant from the west end of Ti-oo-kea; and the middle is situated in the latitude of <geo select="lat">14° 37' S</geo>.,
longitude <geo select="lon">145° 10' W</geo>. These must be the same islands to which Commodore Byron gave the name of
George's Islands. Their situation in longitude, which was determined by lunar observations made near
the shores, and still farther corrected by the difference of longitude carried by the watch to
Otaheite, is 3° 54' more east than he says they lie. This correction, I apprehend, may be applied to
all the islands he discovered.</p><p>After leaving these isles, we steered S.S.W. 1/2 W., and S.W. by S., with a fine easterly gale,
having signs of the vicinity of land, particularly a smooth sea; and on the 19th, at seven in the
morning, land was seen to the westward, which we bore down to, and reached the S.E. end by nine
o'clock. It proved to be another of these half-over-flowed or drowned islands, which are so common
in this part of the ocean; that is, a number of little isles ranged in a circular form, connected
together by a reef or wall of coral rock. The sea is in general, every-where, on their outside,
unfathomable; all their interior parts are covered with water, abounding, I have been told, with
fish and turtle, on which the inhabitants subsist, and sometimes exchange the latter with the high
islanders for cloth, &amp;c. These inland seas would be excellent harbours, were they not shut up
from the access of shipping, which is the case with most of them, if we can believe the report of
the inhabitants of the other isles. Indeed, few of them have been well searched by Europeans; the
little prospect of meeting with fresh water having generally discouraged every attempt of this kind.
I, who have seen a great many, have not yet seen an inlet into one.</p><p>This island is situated in the latitude of <geo select="lat">15° 26' S</geo> , longitude <geo select="lon">146° 20' W</geo>. It is five leagues long
in the direction of N.N.E. and S.S.W. and about three leagues broad. As we drew near the south end,
we saw from the mast-head, another of these low isles bearing S.E., distant about four or five
leagues, but being to windward we could not fetch it. Soon after a third appeared, bearing S.W. by
S., for which we steered; and at <time>two o'clock</time> p.m. reached the east end, which is situated in
latitude <geo select="lat" n="1">15° 47' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">146° 30' W</geo>. This island extends W.N.W. and E.S.E., and is seven
leagues long in that direction; but its breadth is not above two. It is, in all respects, like the
rest; only here are fewer islets, and less firm land on the reef which incloses the lake. As we
ranged the north coast, at the distance of half a mile, we saw people, huts, canoes, and places
built, seemingly for drying of fish. They seemed to be the same sort of people as on Ti-oo-kea, and
were armed with long spikes like them. Drawing near the west end, we discovered another or fourth
island, bearing N.N.E. It seemed to be low, like the others, and lies west from the first isle,
distant six leagues. These four isles I called Palliser's Isles, in honour of my worthy friend Sir
Hugh Palliser, at this time comptroller of the navy.</p><p>Not chusing to run farther in the dark, we spent the night making short boards under the
top-sail; and on the 20th, at day-break, hauled round the west end of the third isle, which was no
sooner done than we found a great swell rolling in from the south; a sure sign that we were clear of
these low islands; and as we saw no more land, I steered S.W. 1/2 S. for Otaheite, having the
advantage of a stout gale at east, attended with showers of rain. It cannot be determined with any
degree of certainty whether the group of isles we had lately seen, be any of those discovered by the
Dutch navigators, or no; the situation of their discoveries not being handed down to us with
sufficient accuracy. It is, however, necessary to observe, that this part of the ocean, that is,
from the latitude of<geo select="lat">20° S</geo>  down to 14° or 12°, and from the meridian of 138° to 148° or <geo select="lon">150° W</geo>., is so
strewed with these low isles, that a navigator cannot proceed with too much caution.</p><p>We made the high land of Otaheite on the 21st, and at <time>noon</time> were about thirteen leagues E. of
Point Venus, for which we steered, and got pretty well in with it by sun set, when we shortened
sail; and having spent the night, which was squally with rain, standing on and off, at <time>eight o'clock</time>
the next morning anchored in Matavai Bay in seven fathoms water. This was no sooner known to the
natives, than many of them made us a visit, and expressed not a little joy at seeing us again.</p><p>As my chief reason for putting in at this place was to give Mr Wales an opportunity to know the
error of the watch by the known longitude, and to determine anew her rate of going, the first thing
we did was to land his instruments, and to erect tents for the reception of a guard and such other
people as it was necessary to have on shore. Sick we had none; the refreshments we had got at the
Marquesas had removed every complaint of that kind.</p><p>On the 23d, showery weather. Our very good friends the natives supplied us with fruit and fish
sufficient for the whole crew.</p><p>On the 24th, Otoo the king, and several other chiefs, with a train of attendants, paid us a
visit, and brought as presents ten or a dozen large hogs, besides fruits, which made them
exceedingly welcome. I was advertised of the king's coming, and looked upon it as a good omen.
Knowing how much it was my interest to make this man my friend, I met him at the tents, and
conducted him and his friends on board, in my boat, where they staid dinner; after which they were
dismissed with suitable presents, and highly pleased with the reception they had met with.</p><p>Next day we had much thunder, lightning, and rain. This did not hinder the king from making me
another visit, and a present of a large quantity of refreshments. It hath been already mentioned,
that when we were at the island of Amsterdam we had collected, amongst other curiosities, some red
parrot feathers. When this was known here, all the principal people of both sexes endeavoured to
ingratiate themselves into our favour by bringing us hogs, fruit, and every other thing the island
afforded, in order to obtain these valuable jewels. Our having these feathers was a fortunate
circumstance, for as they were valuable to the natives, they became so to us; but more especially as
my stock of trade was by this time greatly exhausted; so that, if it had not been for the feathers,
I should have found it difficult to have supplied the ship with the necessary refreshments.</p><p>When I put in at this island, I intended to stay no longer than till Mr Wales had made the
necessary observations for the purposes already mentioned, thinking we should meet with no better
success than we did the last time we were here. But the reception we had already met with, and the
few excursions we had made, which did not exceed the plains of Matavai and Oparree, convinced us of
our error. We found at these two places, built and building, a great number of large canoes, and
houses of every kind; people living in spacious habitations who had not a place to shelter
themselves in eight months before; several large hogs about every house; and every other sign of a
rising state.</p><p>Judging from these favourable circumstances that we should not mend ourselves by removing to
another island, I resolved to make a longer stay, and to begin with the repairs of the ship and
stores, &amp;c. Accordingly I ordered the empty casks and sails to be got ashore to be repaired; the
ship to be caulked, and the rigging to be overhauled; all of which the high southern latitudes had
made indispensably necessary.</p><p>In the morning of the 26th, I went down to Oparree, accompanied by some of the officers and
gentlemen, to pay Otoo a visit by appointment. As we drew near, we observed a number of large canoes
in motion; but we were surprised, when we arrived, to see upwards of three hundred ranged in order,
for some distance, along the shore, all completely equipped and manned, besides a vast number of
armed men upon the shore. So unexpected an armament collected together in our neighbourhood, in the
space of one night, gave rise to various conjectures. We landed, however, in the midst of them, and
were received by a vast multitude, many of them under arms, and many not. The cry of the latter was
<emph rend="italic">Tiyo no Otoo</emph>, and that of the former <emph rend="italic">Tiyo no
Towha</emph>. This chief, we afterwards learnt, was admiral or commander of the fleet and troops
present. The moment we landed I was met by a chief whose name was Tee, uncle to the king, and one of
his prime ministers, of whom I enquired for Otoo. Presently after we were met by Towha, who received
me with great courtesy. He took me by the one hand, and Tee by the other; and, without my knowing
where they intended to carry me, dragged me, as it were, through the crowd that was divided into two
parties, both of which professed themselves my friends, by crying out <emph rend="italic">Tiyo no
Tootee</emph>. One party wanted me to go to Otoo, and the other to remain with Towha. Coming to the
visual place of audience, a mat was spread for me to sit down upon, and Tee left me to go and bring
the king. Towha was unwilling I should sit down, partly insisting on my going with him; but, as I
knew nothing of this chief, I refused to comply. Presently Tee returned, and wanted to conduct me to
the king, taking hold of my hand for that purpose. This Towha opposed; so that, between the one
party and the other, I was like to have been torn in pieces; and was obliged to desire Tee to
desist, and to leave me to the admiral and his party, who conducted me down to the fleet. As soon as
we came before the admiral's vessel, we found two lines of armed men drawn up before her, to keep
off the crowd, as I supposed, and to clear the way for me to go in. But, as I was determined not to
go, I made the water, which was between me and her, an excuse. This did not answer; for a man
immediately squatted himself down at my feet, offering to carry me; and then I declared I would not
go. That very moment Towha quitted me, without my seeing which way he went, nor would any one inform
me. Turning myself round I saw Tee, who, I believe, had never lost sight of me. Enquiring of him for
the king, he told me he was gone into the country Mataou, and advised me to go to my boat; which we
accordingly did, as soon as we could get collected together; for Mr Edgcumbe was the only person
that could keep with me, the others being jostled about in the crowd, in the same manner we had
been.</p><p>When we got into our boat, we took our time to view this grand fleet. The vessels of war
consisted of an hundred and sixty large double canoes, very well equipped, manned, and armed. But I
am not sure that they had their full complement of men or rowers; I rather think not. The chiefs,
and all those on the fighting stages, were dressed in their war habits; that is, in a vast quantity
of cloth, turbans, breast-plates, and helmets. Some of the latter were of such a length as greatly
to encumber the wearer. Indeed, their whole dress seemed to be ill calculated for the day of battle,
and to be designed more for shew than use. Be this as it may, it certainly added grandeur to the
prospect, as they were so complaisant as to shew themselves to the best advantage. The vessels were
decorated with flags, streamers, &amp;c.; so that the whole made a grand and noble appearance, such
as we had never seen before in this sea, and what no one would have expected. Their instruments of
war were clubs, spears, and stones. The vessels were ranged close along-side of each other with
their heads ashore, and their stern to the sea; the admiral's vessel being nearly in the centre.
Besides the vessels of war, there were an hundred and seventy sail of smaller double canoes, all
with a little house upon them, and rigged with mast and sail, which the war canoes had not. These,
we judged, were designed for transports, victuallers, &amp;c.; for in the war-canoes was no sort of
provisions whatever. In these three hundred and thirty vessels, I guessed there were no less than
seven thousand seven hundred and sixty men; a number which appears incredible, especially as we were
told they all belonged to the districts of Attahourou and Ahopatea. In this computation I allow to
each war canoe forty men, troops and rowers, and to each of the small canoes eight. Most of the
gentlemen who were with me, thought the number of men belonging to the war canoes exceeded this. It
is certain that the most of them were fitted to row with more paddles than I have allowed them men;
but, at this time, I think they were not complete. Tupia informed us, when I was first here, that
the whole island raised only between six and seven thousand men; but we now saw two districts only
raise that number; so that he must have taken his account from some old establishment; or else he
only meant <emph rend="italic">Tatatous</emph>, that is warriors, or men trained from their infancy
to arms, and did not include the rowers, and those necessary to navigate the other vessels. I should
think he only spoke of this number as the standing troops or militia of the island, and not their
whole force. This point I shall leave to be discussed in another place, and return to the
subject.</p><p>After we had well viewed this fleet, I wanted much to have seen the admiral, to have gone with
him on board the war-canoes. We enquired for him as we rowed past the fleet to no purpose. We put
ashore and enquired; but the noise and crowd was so great that no one attended to what we said. At
last Tee came and whispered us in the ear, that Otoo was gone to Matavai, advising us to return
thither, and not to land where we were. We accordingly proceeded for the ship; and this intelligence
and advice received from Tee, gave rise to new conjectures. In short, we concluded that this Towha
was some powerful disaffected chief, who was upon the point of making war against his sovereign; for
we could not imagine Otoo had any other reason for leaving Oparree in the manner he did.</p><p>We had not been long gone from Oparree, before the whole fleet was in motion to the westward,
from whence it came. When we got to Matavai, our friends there told us, that this fleet was part of
the armament intended to go against Eimea, whose chief had thrown off the yoke of Otaheite, and
assumed an independency. We were likewise informed that Otoo neither was nor had been at Matavai; so
that we were still at a loss to know why he fled from Oparree. This occasioned another trip thither
in the <time>afternoon</time>, where we found him, and now understood that the reason of his not seeing me in the
morning was, that some of his people having stolen a quantity of my clothes which were on shore
washing, he was afraid I should demand restitution. He repeatedly asked me if I was not angry; and
when I assured him that I was not, and that they might keep what they had got, he was satisfied.
Towha was alarmed, partly on the same account. He thought I was displeased when I refused to go
aboard his vessel; and I was jealous of seeing such a force in our neighbourhood without being able
to know any thing of its design. Thus, by mistaking one another, I lost the opportunity of examining
more narrowly into part of the naval force of this isle, and making myself better acquainted with
its manoeuvres. Such another opportunity may never occur; as it was commanded by a brave, sensible,
and intelligent chief, who would have satisfied us in all the questions we had thought proper to
ask; and as the objects were before us, we could not well have misunderstood each other. It happened
unluckily that Oedidee was not with us in the morning; for Tee, who was the only man we could depend
on, served only to perplex us. Matters being thus cleared up, and mutual presents having passed
between Otoo and me, we took leave and returned on board.</p></div><div type="chapter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N"><head><l>CHAPTER XII.</l><l><emph rend="italic">Some Account of a Visit from Otoo, Towha, and several other Chiefs; also of a
Robbery committed by one of the Natives, and its Consequences, with general Observations on the
Subject.</emph></l></head><p><date>1774 April</date></p><p>In the morning of the 27th, I received a present from Towha, consisting of two large hogs and
some fruit, sent by two of his servants, who had orders not to receive any thing in return; nor
would they when offered them. Soon after I went down to Oparree in my boat, where, having found both
this chief and the king, after a short stay, I brought them on board to dinner, together with
Tarevatoo, the king's younger brother, and Tee. As soon as we drew near the ship, the admiral, who
had never seen one before, began to express much surprise at so new a sight. He was conducted all
over the ship, every part of which he viewed with great attention. On this occasion Otoo was the
principal show-man; for, by this time, he was well acquainted with the different parts of the ship.
After dinner Towha put a hog on board, and retired, without my knowing any thing of the matter, or
having made him any return either for this, or the present I had in the morning. Soon after, the
king and his attendants went away also. Otoo not only seemed to pay this chief much respect, but was
desirous I should do the same; and yet he was jealous of him, but on what account we knew not. It
was but the day before that he frankly told us, Towha was not his friend. Both these chiefs when on
board solicited me to assist them against Tiarabou, notwithstanding a peace at this time subsisted
between the two kingdoms, and we were told their joint force was to go against Eimea. Whether this
was done with a view of breaking with their neighbours and allies if I had promised them assistance,
or only to sound my disposition, I know not. Probably they would have been ready enough to have
embraced an opportunity, which would have enabled them to conquer that kingdom, and annex it to
their own, as it formerly was. Be this as it may, I heard no more of it; indeed, I gave them no
encouragement.</p><p>Next day we had a present of a hog sent by Waheatoua, king of Tiarabou. For this, in return, he
desired a few red feathers, which were, together with other things, sent him accordingly. Mr Forster
and his party set out for the mountains, with an intent to stay out all night. I did not go out of
the ship this day.</p><p>Early in the morning of the 29th, Otoo, Towha, and several other grandees, came on board, and
brought with them as presents, not only provisions, but some of the most valuable curiosities of the
island. I made them returns, with which they were well pleased. I likewise took this opportunity to
repay the civilities I had received from Towha.</p><p>The night before, one of the natives attempting to steal a water-cask from the watering-place,
was caught in the act, sent on board, and put in irons; in which situation Otoo and the other chiefs
saw him. Having made known his crime to them, Otoo begged he might be set at liberty. This I
refused, telling him, that since I punished my people, when they committed the least offence against
his, it was but just this man should be punished also; and as I knew he would not do it, I was
resolved to do it myself. Accordingly, I ordered the man to be carried on shore to the tents, and
having followed myself, with Otoo, Towha, and others, I ordered the guard out, under arms, and the
man to be tied up to a post. Otoo, his sister, and some others, begged hard for him; Towha said not
one word, but was very attentive to every thing going forward. I expostulated with Otoo on the
conduct of this man, and of his people in general; telling him, that neither I, nor any of my
people, took any thing from them, without first paying for it; enumerating the articles we gave in
exchange for such and such things; and urging that it was wrong in them to steal from us, who were
their friends. I moreover told him, that the punishing this man would be the means of saving the
lives of others of his people, by deterring them from committing crimes of this nature, in which
some would certainly be shot dead, one time or another. With these and other arguments, which I
believe he pretty well understood, he seemed satisfied, and only desired the man might not be <emph rend="italic">Matterou</emph> (or killed). I then ordered the crowd, which was very great, to be
kept at a proper distance, and, in the presence of them all, ordered the fellow two dozen lashes
with a cat-o'-nine-tails, which he bore with great firmness, and was then set at liberty. After this
the natives were going away; but Towha stepped forth, called them back, and harangued them for near
half an hour. His speech consisted of short sentences, very little of which I understood; but, from
what we could gather, he recapitulated part of what I had said to Otoo; named several advantages
they had received from us; condemned their present conduct, and recommended a different one for the
future. The gracefulness of his action, and the attention with which he was heard, bespoke him a
great orator.</p><p>Otoo said not one word. As soon as Towha had ended his speech, I ordered the marines to go
through their exercise, and to load and fire in vollies with ball; and as they were very quick in
their manoeuvres, it is easier to conceive than to describe the amazement the natives were under the
whole time, especially those who had not seen any thing of the kind before.</p><p>This being over, the chiefs took leave, and retired with all their attendants, scarcely more
pleased than frightened at what they had seen. In the evening Mr Forster and his party returned from
the mountains, where he had spent the night; having found some new plants, and some others which
grew in New Zealand. He saw Huaheine, which lies forty leagues to the westward; by which a judgment
may be formed of the height of the mountains in Otaheite.</p><p>Next morning I had an opportunity to see the people of ten war-canoes go through part of their
paddling exercise. They had put off from the shore before I was apprised of it; so that I was only
present at their landing. They were properly equipped for war, the warriors with their arms, and
dressed in their war habits, &amp;c. In landing, I observed that the moment the canoe touched the
ground, all the rowers leaped out, and with the assistance of a few people on the shore, dragged the
canoe on dry land to her proper place; which being done, every one walked off with his paddle,
&amp;c. All this was executed with such expedition, that in five minutes time after putting ashore,
you could not tell that any thing of the kind had been going forward. I thought these vessels were
thinly manned with rowers; the most being not above thirty, and the least sixteen or eighteen. I
observed the warriors on the stage encouraged the rowers to exert themselves. Some youths sat high
up in the curved stern, above the steersmen, with white wands in their hands. I know not what they
were placed there for, unless it was to look out and direct, or give notice of what they saw, as
they were elevated above every one else. Tarevatoo, the king's brother, gave me the first notice of
these canoes being at sea; and knowing that Mr Hodges made drawings of every thing curious, desired
of his own accord that he might be sent for. I being at this time on shore with Tarevatoo, Mr Hodges
was therefore with me, and had an opportunity to collect some materials for a large drawing or
picture of the fleet assembled at Oparree, which conveys a far better idea of it than can be
expressed by words. Being present when the warriors undressed, I was surprised at the quantity and
weight of cloth they had upon them, not conceiving how it was possible for them to stand under it in
time of battle. Not a little was wrapped round their heads as a turban, and made into a cap. This,
indeed, might be necessary in preventing a broken head. Many had, fixed to one of this sort of caps,
dried branches of small shrubs covered over with white feathers, which, however, could only be for
ornament.</p><p><date>1774 May</date></p><p>On the 1st of May, I had a very great supply of provisions sent and brought by different chiefs;
and the next day received a present from Towha, sent by his servants, consisting of a hog, and a
boat-load of various sorts of fruits and roots. The like present I also had from Otoo, brought by
Tarevatoo, who stayed dinner; after which I went down to Opparree, paid a visit to Otoo, and
returned on board in the evening.</p><p>On the 3d, in looking into the condition of our sea-provisions, we found that the biscuit was in
a state of decay, and that the airing and picking we had given it at New Zealand, had not been of
that service we expected and intended; so that we were obliged to take it all on shore here, where
it underwent another airing and cleaning, in which a good deal was found wholly rotten and unfit to
be eaten. We could not well account for this decay in our bread, especially as it was packed in good
casks, and stowed in a dry part of the hold. We judged it was owing to the ice we so frequently took
in when to the southward, which made the hold damp and cold, and to the great heat which succeeded
when to the north. Be it this, or any other cause, the loss was the same to us; it put us to a
scanty allowance of this article; and we had bad bread to eat too.</p><p>On the 4th, nothing worthy of note.</p><p>On the 5th, the king and several other great men, paid us a visit, and brought with them, as
usual, some hogs and fruit. In the <time>afternoon</time>, the botanists set out for the mountains, and returned
the following evening, having made some new discoveries in their way.</p><p>On going ashore in the morning of the 7th, I found Otoo at the tents, and took the opportunity to
ask his leave to cut down some trees, for fuel. He not well understanding me, I took him to some
growing near the sea-shore, where I presently made him comprehend what I wanted, and he as readily
gave his consent. I told him, at the same time, that I should cut down no trees that bore any fruit.
He was pleased with this declaration, and told it aloud, several times, to the people about us.</p><p>In the <time>afternoon</time>, this chief and the whole of the royal family, viz. his father, brother, and
three sisters, paid us a visit on board. This was properly his father's visit of ceremony. He
brought me, as a present, a complete mourning dress, a curiosity we most valued. In return, I gave
him whatever he desired, which was not a little, and having distributed red feathers to all the
others, conducted them ashore in my boat. Otoo was so well pleased with the reception he and his
friends met with, that he told me, at parting, I might cut down as many trees as I pleased, and what
sort I pleased.</p><p>During the night, between the 7th and 8th, some time in the middle watch, all our friendly
connections received an interruption, through the negligence of one of the centinels on shore. He
having either slept or quitted his post, gave one of the natives an opportunity to carry off his
musket. The first news I heard of it was from Tee, whom Otoo had sent on board for that purpose, and
to desire that I would go to him, for that he was <emph rend="italic">mataoued</emph>. We were not
well enough acquainted with their language to understand all Tee's story; but we understood enough
to know that something had happened which had alarmed the king. In order, therefore, to be fully
informed, I went ashore with Tee and Tarevatoo, who had slept aboard all night. As soon as we
landed, I was informed of the whole by the serjeant who commanded the party. I found the natives all
alarmed, and the most of them fled. Tarevatoo slipped from me in a moment, and hardly any remained
by me but Tee. With him I went to look for Otoo; and, as we advanced, I endeavoured to allay the
fears of the people, but, at the same time, insisted on the musket being restored. After travelling
some distance into the country, enquiring of every one we saw for Otoo, Tee stopped all at once and
advised me to return, saying, that Otoo was gone to the mountains, and he would proceed and tell him
that I was still his friend; a question which had been asked me fifty times by different people, and
if I was angry, &amp;c. Tee also promised that he would use his endeavours to recover the musket. I
was now satisfied it was to no purpose to go farther; for, although I was alone and unarmed, Otoo's
fears were such, that he durst not see me; and, therefore, I took Tee's advice, and returned aboard.
After this I sent Oedidee to Otoo to let him know that his fears were ill- grounded; for that I only
required the return of the musket, which I knew was in his power.</p><p>Soon after Oedidee was gone, we observed six large canoes coming round Point Venus. Some people
whom I had sent out, to watch the conduct of the neighbouring inhabitants, informed me they were
laden with baggage, fruit, hogs, &amp;c. There being room for suspecting that some person belonging
to these canoes had committed the theft, I presently came to a resolution to intercept them; and
having put off in a boat for that purpose, gave orders for another to follow. One of the canoes,
which was some distance ahead of the rest, came directly for the ship. I went alongside this, and
found two or three women in her whom I knew. They told me they were going on board the ship with
something for me; and, on my enquiring of them for Otoo, was told he was then at the tents. Pleased
with this news, I contradicted the orders I had given for intercepting the other canoes, thinking
they might be coming on board also, as well as this one, which I left within a few yards of the
ship, and rowed ashore to speak with Otoo. But when I landed, I was told that he had not been there,
nor knew they any thing of him. On my looking behind me, I saw all the canoes making off in the
greatest haste; even the one I had left alongside the ship had evaded going on board, and was making
her escape. Vexed at being thus outwitted, I resolved to pursue them; and as I passed the ship, gave
orders to send another boat for the same purpose. Five out of six we took, and brought alongside;
but the first, which acted the finesse so well, got clear off. When we got on board with our prizes,
I learnt that the people who had deceived me, used no endeavours to lay hold of the ship on the side
they were up on, but let their canoe drop past, as if they meant to come under the stern, or on the
other side; and that the moment they were past, they paddled off with all speed. Thus the canoe, in
which were only a few women, was to have amused us with false stories as they actually did, while
the others, in which were most of the effects, got off.</p><p>In one of the canoes we had taken, was a chief, a friend of Mr Forster's, who had hitherto called
himself an <emph rend="italic">Earee</emph>, and would have been much offended if any one had called
his title in question; also three women, his wife and daughter, and the mother of the late Toutaha.
These, together with the canoes, I resolved to detain, and to send the chief to Otoo, thinking he
would have weight enough with him to obtain the return of the musket, as his own property was at
stake. He was, however, very unwilling to go on this embassy, and made various excuses, one of which
was his being of too low a rank for this honourable employment; saying he was no <emph rend="italic">Earee</emph>, but a <emph rend="italic">Manahouna</emph>, and, therefore, was not a fit person to
be sent; that an <emph rend="italic">Earee</emph> ought to be sent to speak to an <emph rend="italic">Earee</emph>; and as there were no <emph rend="italic">Earees</emph> but Otoo and
myself, it would be much more proper for me to go. All his arguments would have availed him little,
if Tee and Oedidee had not at this time come on board, and given a new turn to the affair, by
declaring that the man who stole the musket was from Tiarabou, and had gone with it to that kingdom,
so that it was not in the power of Otoo to recover it. I very much doubted their veracity, till they
asked me to send a boat to Waheatoua, the king of Tiarabou, and offered to go themselves in her, and
get it. I asked why this could not be done without my sending a boat? They said, it would not
otherwise be given to them.</p><p>This story of theirs, although it did not quite satisfy me, nevertheless carried with it a
probability of truth; for which reason I thought it better to drop the affair altogether, rather
than to punish a nation for a crime I was not sure any of its members had committed. I therefore
suffered my new ambassador to depart with his two canoes without executing his commission. The other
three canoes belonged to Maritata, a Tiarabou chief, who had been some days about the tents; and
there was good reason to believe it was one of his people that carried off the musket. I intended to
have detained them; but as Tee and Oedidee both assured me that Maritata and his people were quite
innocent, I suffered them to be taken away also, and desired Tee to tell Otoo, that I should give
myself no farther concern about the musket, since I was satisfied none of his people had stolen it.
Indeed, I thought it was irrecoverably lost; but, in the dusk of the evening it was brought to the
tents, together with some other things we had lost, which we knew nothing of, by three men who had
pursued the thief, and taken them from him. I know not if they took this trouble of their own
accord, or by the order of Otoo. I rewarded them, and made no other enquiry about it. These men, as
well as some others present, assured me that it was one of Maritata's people who had committed this
theft; which vexed me that I had let his canoes so easily slip through my fingers. Here, I believe,
both Tee and Oedidee designedly deceived me.</p><p>When the musket and other things were brought in, every one then present, or who came after,
pretended to have had some hand in recovering them, and claimed a reward accordingly. But there was
no one who acted this farce so well as Nuno, a man of some note, and well known to us when I was
here in 1769. This man came, with all the savage fury imaginable in his countenance, and a large
club in his hand, with which he beat about him, in order to shew us how he alone had killed the
thief; when, at the same time, we all knew that he had not been out of his house the whole time.</p><p>Thus ended this troublesome day; and next morning early, Tee, Otoo's faithful ambassador, came
again on board, to acquaint me that Otoo was gone to Oparree, and desired I would send a person (one
of the natives as I understood), to tell him that I was still his <emph rend="italic">Tiyo</emph>. I
asked him why he did not do this himself, as I had desired. He made some excuse; but, I believe the
truth was, he had not seen him. In short, I found it was necessary for me to go myself; for, while
we thus spent our time in messages, we remained without fruit, a stop being put to all exchanges of
this nature; that is, the natives brought nothing to market. Accordingly, a party of us set out with
Tee in our company, and proceeded to the very utmost limits of Oparree, where, after waiting some
considerable time, and several messages having passed, the king at last made his appearance. After
we were seated under the shade of some trees, as usual, and the first salutations were over, he
desired me to <emph rend="italic">parou</emph> (that is, to speak). Accordingly, I began with
blaming him for being frightened and alarmed at what had happened, since I had always professed
myself his friend, and I was not angry with him or any of his people, but with those of Tiarabou,
who were the thieves. I was then asked, how I came to fire at the canoes? Chance on this occasion
furnished me with a good excuse. I told them, that they belonged to Maritata, a Tiarabou man, one of
whose people had stolen the musket, and occasioned all this disturbance; and if I had them in my
power I would destroy them, or any other belonging to Tiarabou. This declaration pleased them, as I
expected, from the natural aversion the one kingdom has to the other. What I said was enforced by
presents, which perhaps had the greatest weight with them. Thus were things once more restored to
their former state; and Otoo promised on his part, that the next day we should be supplied with
fruit, &amp;c. as usual.</p><p>We then returned with him to his proper residence at Oparree, and there took a view of some of
his dock-yards (for such they well deserve to be called) and large canoes; some lately built, and
others building; two of which were the largest I had ever seen in this sea; or indeed any where
else, under that name. This done, we returned on board, with Tee in our company; who, after he had
dined with us, went to inform old Happi, the king's father, that all matters were again
accommodated.</p><p>This old chief was at this time in the neighbourhood of Matavai; and it should seem, from what
followed, that he was not pleased with the conditions; for that same evening all the women, which
were not a few, were sent for out of the ship, and people stationed on different parts of the shore,
to prevent any from coming off; and the next morning no supplies whatever being brought, on my
enquiring into the reason, I was told Happi was <emph rend="italic">mataoued</emph>. Chagrined at
this disappointment as I was, I forbore taking any step, from a supposition that Tee had not seen
him, or that Otoo's orders had not yet reached Matavai. A supply of fruit sent us from Oparree, and
some brought us by our friends, served us for the present, and made us less anxious about it. Thus
matters stood till the <time>afternoon</time>, when Otoo himself came to the tents with a large supply. Thither I
went, and expostulated with him for not permitting the people in our neighbourhood to bring us fruit
as usual, insisting on his giving immediate orders about it; which he either did or had done before.
For presently after, more was brought us than we could well manage. This was not to be wondered at,
for the people had every thing in readiness to bring, the moment they were permitted, and I believe
thought themselves as much injured by the restriction as we did.</p><p>Otoo desiring to see some of the great guns fire from the ship, I ordered twelve to be shotted
and fired towards the sea. As he had never seen a cannon fired before, the sight gave him as much
pain as pleasure. In the evening, we entertained him with fire-works, which gave him great
satisfaction.</p><p>Thus ended all our differences, on which I beg leave to suggest the following remarks. I have had
occasion before, in this journal, to observe that these people were continually watching
opportunities to rob us. This their governors either encouraged, or had not power to prevent; but
most probably the former, because the offender was always screened. That they should commit such
daring thefts was the more extraordinary, as they frequently run the risk of being shot in the
attempt; and if the article that they stole was of any consequence, they knew they should be obliged
to make restitution. The moment a theft of this kind was committed, it spread like the wind over the
whole neighbourhood. They judged of the consequences from what they had got. If it were a trifle,
and such an article as we usually gave them, little or no notice was taken of it; but if the
contrary, every one took the alarm, and moved off with his moveables in all haste. The chief then
was <emph rend="italic">mataoued</emph>, giving orders to bring us no supplies, and flying to some
distant part. All this was sometimes done so suddenly, that we obtained, by these appearances, the
first intelligence of our being robbed. Whether we obliged them to make restitution or no, the chief
must be reconciled before any of the people were permitted to bring in refreshments. They knew very
well we could not do without them, and therefore they never failed strictly to observe this rule,
without ever considering, that all their war-canoes, on which the strength of their nation depends,
their houses, and even the very fruit they refused to supply us with, were entirely in our power. It
is hard to say how they would act, were one to destroy any of these things. Except the detaining
some of their canoes for a while, I never touched the least article of their property. Of the two
extremes I always chose that which appeared the most equitable and mild. A trifling present to the
chief always succeeded to my wish, and very often put things upon a better footing than they had
been before. That they were the first aggressors had very little influence on my conduct in this
respect, because no difference happened but when it was so. My people very rarely or never broke
through the rules I thought it necessary to prescribe. Had I observed a different conduct, I must
have been a loser by it in the end; and all I could expect, after destroying some part of their
property, would have been the empty honour of obliging them to make the first overture towards an
accommodation. But who knows if this would have been the event? Three things made them our fast
friends. Their own good-nature and benevolent disposition; gentle treatment on our part; and the
dread of our fire-arms. By our ceasing to observe the second; the first would have worn out of
course; and the too frequent use of the latter would have excited a spirit of revenge, and perhaps
have taught them that fire-arms were not such terrible things as they had imagined. They were very
sensible of the superiority of their numbers; and no one knows what an enraged multitude might
do.</p></div><div type="chapter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N"><head><l>CHAPTER XIII.</l><l><emph rend="italic">Preparations to leave the Island. Another Naval Review, and various other
Incidents; with some Account of the Island, its Naval Force, and Number of Inhabitants.</emph></l></head><p><date>1774 May</date></p><p>In the morning of the 11th, a very large supply of fruit was brought us from all parts. Some of
it came from Towha, the admiral, sent as usual by his servants, with orders to receive nothing in
return. But he desired I would go and see him at Attahourou, as he was ill and could not come to me.
As I could not well undertake this journey, I sent Oedidee along with Towha's servants, with a
present suitable to that which I had in so genteel a manner received from him. As the most essential
repairs of the ship were nearly finished, I resolved to leave Otaheite in a few days; and
accordingly ordered every thing to be got off from the shore, that the natives might see we were
about to depart.</p><p>On the 12th, old Oberea, the woman who, when the Dolphin was here in 1767, was thought to be
queen of the island, and whom I had not seen since 1769, paid us a visit, and brought a present of
hogs and fruit. Soon after came Otoo, with a great retinue, and a large quantity of provisions. I
was pretty liberal in my returns, thinking it might be the last time I should see these good people,
who had so liberally relieved our wants; and in the evening entertained them with fire-works.</p><p>On the 13th, wind easterly, fair weather. Nevertheless we were not ready to sail, as Otoo had
made me promise to see him again; and I had a present to make him, which I reserved to the last.
Oedidee was not yet come back from Attahourou; various reports arose concerning him: Some said he
had returned to Matavai; others, that he would not return; and some would have it, that he was at
Oparree. In order to know more of the truth, a party of us in the evening went down to Oparee; where
we found him, and likewise Towha, who, notwithstanding his illness, had resolved to see me before I
sailed; and had got thus far on his journey. He was afflicted with a swelling in his feet and legs,
which had entirely taken away the use of them. As the day was far spent, we were obliged to shorten
our stay; and after seeing Otoo, we returned with Oedidee on board.</p><p>This youth, I found, was desirous of remaining at this isle, having before told him, as likewise
many others, that we should not return. I now mentioned to him, that he was at liberty to remain
here; or to quit us at Ulietea; or to go with us to England; frankly owning that if he chose the
latter, it was very probable he would never return to his country; in which case I would take care
of him, and he must afterwards look upon me as his father. He threw his arms about me, and wept
much, saying many people persuaded him to remain at Otaheite. I told him to go ashore and speak to
his friends, and then come to me in the morning. He was well beloved in the ship; so that every one
was persuading him to go with us; telling what great things he would see in England, and the immense
riches (according to his idea of riches) he would return with. But I thought proper to undeceive
him, as knowing that the only inducement to his going, was the expectation of returning, and I could
see no prospect of an opportunity of that kind happening, unless a ship should be expressly sent out
for that purpose; which neither I, nor anyone else, had a right to expect. I thought it an act of
the highest injustice to take a person from these isles, under any promise which was not in my power
to perform. At this time indeed it was quite unnecessary; for many youths voluntarily offered
themselves to go, and even to remain and die in <emph rend="italic">Pretanee</emph>; as they call
our country. Otoo importuned me much to take one or two to collect red feathers for him at
Amsterdam, willing to risk the chance of their returning. Some of the gentlemen on board were
likewise desirous of taking some as servants; but I refused every solicitation of this kind,
knowing, from experience, they would be of no use to us in the course of the voyage; and farther my
views were not extended. What had the greatest weight with me was, the thinking myself bound to see
they were afterwards properly taken care of, as they could not be carried from their native spot
without consent.</p><p>Next morning early, Oedidee came on board, with a resolution to remain on the island; but Mr
Forster prevailed upon him to go with us to Ulietea. Soon after, Towha, Potatou, Oamo, Happi,
Oberea, and several more of our friends, came on board with fruit, &amp;c. Towha was hoisted in and
placed on a chair on the quarter-deck; his wife was with him. Amongst the various articles which I
gave this chief, was an English pendant, which pleased him more than all the rest, especially after
he had been instructed in the use of it.</p><p>We had no sooner dispatched our friends, than we saw a number of war-canoes coming round the
point of Oparree. Being desirous of having a nearer view of them, accompanied by some of the
officers and gentlemen, I hastened down to Oparree, which we reached before all the canoes were
landed, and had an opportunity of seeing in what manner they approached the shore. When they got
before the place where they intended to land, they formed themselves into divisions, consisting of
three or four, or perhaps more, lashed square and close along-side of each other; and then each
division, one after the other, paddled in for the shore with all their might, and conducted in so
judicious a manner, that they formed and closed a line along, the shore, to an inch. The rowers were
encouraged to exert their strength by their leaders on the stages, and directed by a man who stood
with a wand in his hand in the forepart of the middlemost vessel. This man, by words and actions,
directed the paddlers when all should paddle, when either the one side or the other should cease,
&amp;c.; for the steering paddles alone were not sufficient to direct them. All these motions they
observed with such quickness, as clearly shewed them to be expert in their business. After Mr Hodges
had made a drawing of them, as they lay ranged along the shore, we landed and took a nearer view of
them, by going on board several. This fleet consisted of forty sail, equipped in the same manner as
those we had seen before, belonged to the little district of Tettaha, and were come to Oparree to be
reviewed before the king, as the former fleet had been. There were attending on his fleet some small
double canoes, which they called <emph rend="italic">Marais</emph>, having on their fore-part a kind
of double bed place laid over with green leaves, each just sufficient to hold one man. These, they
told us, were to lay their dead upon; their chiefs I suppose they meant, otherwise their slain must
be few. Otoo, who was present, caused at my request some of their troops to go through their
exercise on shore. Two parties first began with clubs, but this was over almost as soon as begun; so
that I had no time to make my observations upon it. They then went to single combat, and exhibited
the various methods of fighting, with great alertness; parrying off the blows and pushes which each
combatant aimed at the other, with great dexterity. Their arms were clubs and spears; the latter
they also use as darts. In fighting with the club, all blows intended to be given the legs, were
evaded by leaping over it; and those intended for the head, by couching a little, and leaping on one
side; thus the blow would fall to the ground. The spear or dart was parried by fixing the point of a
spear in the ground right before them, holding it in an inclined position, more or less elevated
according to the part of the body they saw their antagonist intending to make a push, or throw his
dart at, and by moving the hand a little to the right or left, either the one or the other was
turned off with great ease. I thought that when one combatant had parried off the blows, &amp;c. of
the other, he did not use the advantage which seemed to me to accrue. As for instance, after he had
parried off a dart, he still stood on the defensive, and suffered his antagonist to take up another,
when I thought there was time to run him through the body.</p><p>These combatants had no superfluous dress upon them; an unnecessary piece of cloth or two, which
they had on when they began, were presently torn off by the by-standers, and given to some of our
gentlemen present. This being over, the fleet departed; not in any order, but as fast as they could
be got afloat; and we went with Otoo to one of his dock-yards, where the two large <emph rend="italic">pahies</emph> or canoes were building, each of which was an hundred and eight feet
long. They were almost ready to launch, and were intended to make one joint double <emph rend="italic">pahie</emph> or canoe. The king begged of me a grappling and rope, to which I added an
English jack and pendant (with the use of which he was well acquainted), and desired the <emph rend="italic">pahie</emph> might be called Britannia. This he very readily agreed to; and she was
named accordingly. After this he gave me a hog, and a turtle of about sixty pounds weight, which was
put privately into our boat; the giving it away not being agreeable to some of the great lords about
him, who were thus deprived of a feast. He likewise would have given me a large shark they had
prisoner in a creek (some of his fins being cut off, so that he could not make his escape), but the
fine pork and fish we had got at this isle, had spoiled our palates for such food. The king, and
Tee, his prime minister, accompanied us on board to dinner; and after it was over, took a most
affectionate farewell. He hardly ever ceased soliciting me, this day, to return to Otaheite; and
just before he went out of the ship, took a youth by the hand, and presented him to me, desiring I
would keep him on board to go to Amsterdam to collect red feathers. I told him I could not, since I
knew he would never return; but that if any ship should happen to come from Britain to this isle, I
would either bring or send him red feathers in abundance. This in some measure satisfied him; but
the youth was exceedingly desirous of going; and if I had not come to a resolution to carry no one
from the isles (except Oedidee if he chose to go), and but just refused Mr Forster the liberty of
taking a boy, I believe I should have consented. Otoo remained alongside in his canoe till we were
under sail, when we put off, and was saluted with three guns.</p><p>Our treatment here was such as had induced one of our gunner's mates to form a plan to remain at
this isle. He knew he could not execute it with success while we lay in the bay, therefore took the
opportunity, as soon as we were out, the boats in, and sails set, to slip overboard, being a good
swimmer. But he was discovered before he got clear of the ship; and we presently hoisted a boat out,
and took him up. A canoe was observed about half-way between us and the shore, seemingly coming
after us. She was intended to take him up; but as soon as the people in her saw our boat, they kept
at a distance. This was a pre-concerted plan between the man and them, which Otoo was acquainted
with, and had encouraged. When I considered this man's situation in life, I did not think him so
culpable, nor the resolution he had taken of staying here so extraordinary, as it may at first
appear. He was an Irishman by birth, and had sailed in the Dutch service. I picked him up at Batavia
on my return from my former voyage, and he had been with me ever since. I never learnt that he had
either friends or connections, to confine him to any particular part of the world. All nations were
alike to him. Where then could such a man be more happy than at one of these isles? where, in one of
the finest climates in the world, he could enjoy not only the necessaries, but the luxuries of life,
in ease and plenty. I know not if he might not have obtained my consent, if he had applied for it in
a proper time. As soon as we had got him on board, and the boat in, I steered for Huaheine, in order
to pay a visit to our friends there. But before we leave Otaheite, it will be necessary to give some
account of the present state of that island; especially as it differs very much from what it was
eight months before.</p><p>I have already mentioned the improvements we found in the plains of Oparree and Matavai. The same
was observable in every other part into which we came. It seemed to us almost incredible, that so
many large canoes and houses could be built in so short a space as eight months. The iron tools
which they had got from the English, and other nations who have lately touched at the isle, had no
doubt greatly accelerated the work; and they had no want of hands, as I shall soon make appear.</p><p>The number of hogs was another thing that excited our wonder. Probably they were not so scarce
when we were here before, as we imagined, and not chusing to part with any, they had conveyed them
out of our sight. Be this as it may, we now not only got as many as we could consume during our
stay, but some to take to sea with us.</p><p>When I was last here, I conceived but an unfavourable opinion of Otoo's talents. The improvements
since made in the island convinced me of my mistake; and that he must have been a man of good parts.
He had indeed some judicious sensible men about him, who, I believe, had a great share in the
government. In truth, we know not how far his power extended as king, nor how far he could command
the assistance of the other chiefs, or was controulable by them. It should seem, however, that all
had contributed towards bringing the isle to its present flourishing state. We cannot doubt that
there were divisions amongst the great men of this state, as well as of most others; or else why did
the king tell us, that Towha the admiral, and Poatatou were not his friends? They were two leading
chiefs; and he must have been jealous of them on account of their great power; for on every occasion
he seemed to court their interest. We had reason to believe that they raised by far the greatest
number of vessels and men, to go against Eimea, and were to be two of the commanders in the
expedition, which we were told was to take place five days after our departure. Waheatoua, king of
Tiarabou, was to send a fleet to join that of Otoo, to assist him in reducing to obedience the chief
of Eimea. I think, we were told, that young prince was one of the commanders. One would suppose that
so small an island as Eimea would hardly have attempted to make head against the united force of
these two kingdoms, but have endeavoured to settle matters by negociation. Yet we heard of no such
thing; on the contrary, every one spoke of nothing but fighting. Towha told us more than once, that
he should die there; which, in some measure, shews that he thought of it. Oedidee told me the battle
would be fought at sea; in which case the other must have a fleet nearly equal, if not quite, to the
one going against them; which I think was not probable. It was therefore more likely they would
remain ashore upon the defensive; as we were told they did about five or six years ago, when
attacked by the people of Tiarabou, whom they repulsed. Five general officers were to command in
this expedition; of which number Otoo was one; and if they named them in order according to the
posts they held, Otoo was only the third in command. This seems probable enough; as being but a
young man, he could not have sufficient experience to command such an expedition, where the greatest
skill and judgment seemed to be necessary. I confess I would willingly have staid five days longer,
had I been sure the expedition would have then taken place; but it rather seemed that they wanted us
to be gone first. We had been all along told, it would be ten moons before it took place; and it was
not till the evening before we sailed, that Otoo and Towha told us it was to be in five days after
we were gone; as if it were necessary to have that time to put every thing in order; for, while we
lay there, great part of their time and attention was taken up with us. I had observed that for
several days before we sailed, Otoo and the other chiefs had ceased to solicit my assistance, as
they were continually doing at first, till I assured Otoo that, if they got their fleet ready in
time, I would sail with them down to Eimea: After this I heard no more of it. They probably had
taken it into consideration, and concluded themselves safer without me; well knowing it would be in
my power to give the victory to whom I pleased; and that, at the best, I might thwart some favourite
custom, or run away with the spoils. But be their reasons what they might, they certainly wanted us
to be gone, before they undertook any thing. Thus we were deprived of seeing the whole fleet
equipped on this occasion; and perhaps of being spectators of a sea-fight, and by that means,
gaining some knowledge of their manoeuvres.</p><p>I never could learn what number of vessels were to go on this expedition. We knew of no more than
two hundred and ten, besides smaller canoes to serve as transports, &amp;c. and the fleet of
Tiarabou, the strength of which we never learnt. Nor could I ever learn the number of men necessary
to man this fleet; and whenever I asked the question, the answer was <emph rend="italic">Warou,
warou, warou te Tata</emph>, that is, many, many, many, men; as if the number far exceeded their
arithmetic. If we allow forty men to each war-canoe, and four to each of the others, which is
thought a moderate computation, the number will amount to nine thousand. An astonishing number to be
raised in four districts; and one of them, viz. Matavia, did not equip a fourth part of its fleet.
The fleet of Tiarabou is not included in this account; and many other districts might be arming,
which we knew nothing of. I however believe, that the whole isle did not arm on this occasion; for
we saw not the least preparations making in Oparree. From what we saw and could learn, I am clearly
of opinion that the chief or chiefs of each district superintended the equipping of the fleet
belonging to that district; but after they are equipped, they must pass in review before the king,
and be approved of by him. By this means he knows the state of the whole, before they assemble to go
on service.</p><p>It hath been already observed, that the number of war-canoes belonging to Attahourou and Ahopata
was a hundred and sixty; to Tettaba, forty; and to Matavia, ten; and that this district did not
equip one-fourth part of their number. If we suppose every district in the island, of which there
are forty-three, to raise and equip the same number of war-canoes as Tettaha, we shall find, by this
estimate, that the whole island can raise and equip one thousand seven hundred and twenty
war-canoes, and sixty-eight thousand able men; allowing forty men to each canoe. And as these cannot
amount to above one-third part of the number of both sexes, children included, the whole island
cannot contain less than two hundred and four thousand inhabitants, a number which at first sight
exceeded my belief. But when I came to reflect on the vast swarms which appeared wherever we came, I
was convinced that this estimate was not much, if at all, too great. There cannot be a greater proof
of the riches and fertility of Otaheite (not forty leagues in circuit) than its supporting such a
number of inhabitants.</p><p>This island made formerly but one kingdom; how long it has been divided into two, I cannot
pretend to say; but I believe not long. The kings of Tiarabou are a branch of the family of those of
Opoureonu; at present, the two are nearly related; and, I think, the former is, in some measure,
dependent on the latter. Otoo is styled <emph rend="italic">Earee de hie</emph> of the whole island;
and we have been told that Waheatoua, the king of Tiarabou, must uncover before him, in the same
manner as the meanest of his subjects. This homage is due to Otoo as <emph rend="italic">Earee de
hie</emph> of the isle, to Tarevatou, his brother, and his second sister; to the one as heir, and to
the other as heir apparent; his eldest sister being married, is not entitled to this homage.</p><p>The <emph rend="italic">Eowas</emph> and <emph rend="italic">Whannos</emph>, we have sometimes
seen covered before the king; but whether by courtesy, or by virtue of their office, we never could
learn. These men, who are the principal persons about the king, and form his court, are generally,
if not always, his relations; Tee, whom I have so often mentioned, was one of them. We have been
told, that the <emph rend="italic">Eowas</emph>, who have the first rank, attend in their turns, a
certain number each day, which occasioned us to call them lords in waiting; but whether this was
really so, I cannot say. We seldom found Tee absent; indeed his attendance was necessary, as being
best able to negociate matters between us and them, on which service he was always employed; and he
executed it, I have reason to believe, to the satisfaction of both parties.</p><p>It is to be regretted, that we know little more of this government than the general out-line;
for, of its subdivisions, classes, or orders of the constituent parts, how disposed, or in what
manner connected, so as to form one body politic, we know but little. We are sure, however, that it
is of the feudal kind; and if we may judge from what we have seen, it has sufficient stability, and
is by no means badly constructed.</p><p>The <emph rend="italic">Eowas</emph> and <emph rend="italic">Whannos</emph> always eat with the
king; indeed I do not know if any one is excluded from this privilege but the <emph rend="italic">Toutous</emph>. For as to the women, they are out of the question, as they never eat with the men,
let their rank be ever so much elevated.</p><p>Notwithstanding this kind of kingly establishment, there was very little about Otoo's person or
court by which a stranger could distinguish the king from the subject. I seldom saw him dressed in
any thing but a common piece of cloth wrapped round his loins; so that he seemed to avoid all
unnecessary pomp, and even to demean himself more than any other of the <emph rend="italic">Earees</emph>. I have seen him work at a paddle, in coming to and going from the ship, in common
with the other paddlers; and even when some of his <emph rend="italic">Toutous</emph> sat looking
on. All have free access to him, and speak to him wherever they see him, without the least ceremony;
such is the easy freedom which every individual of this happy isle enjoys. I have observed that the
chiefs of these isles are more beloved by the bulk of the people, than feared. May we not from hence
conclude, that the government is mild and equitable?</p><p>We have mentioned that Waheatoua or Tiarabou is related to Otoo. The same may be said of the
chiefs of Eimea, Tapamanoo, Huaheine, Ulietea, Otaha, and Bolabola; for they are all related to the
royal family of Otaheite. It is a maxim with the <emph rend="italic">Earees</emph>, and others of
superior rank, never to intermarry with the <emph rend="italic">Toutous</emph>, or others of
inferior rank. Probably this custom is one great inducement to the establishing of the societies
called <emph rend="italic">Eareeoies</emph>. It is certain that these societies greatly prevent the
increase of the superior classes of people of which they are composed, and do not at all interfere
with the inferiors, or <emph rend="italic">Toutous</emph>; for I never heard of one of these being
an <emph rend="italic">Eareeoy</emph>. Nor did I ever hear that a <emph rend="italic">Toutou</emph>
could rise in life above the rank in which he was born.</p><p>I have occasionally mentioned the extraordinary fondness the people of Otaheite shewed for red
feathers. These they call <emph rend="italic">Oora</emph>, and they are as valuable here as jewels
are in Europe, especially those which they call <emph rend="italic">Ooravine</emph>, and grow on the
head of the green paraquet: Indeed, all red feathers are esteemed, but none equally with these; and
they are such good judges as to know very well how to distinguish one sort from another. Many of our
people attempted to deceive them by dying other feathers; but I never heard that any one succeeded.
These feathers they make up in little bunches, consisting of eight or ten, and fix them to the end
of a small cord about three or four inches long, which is made of the strong outside fibres of the
cocoa-nut, twisted so hard that it is like a wire, and serves as a handle to the bunch. Thus
prepared, they are used as symbols of the <emph rend="italic">Eatuas</emph>, or divinities, in all
their religious ceremonies. I have often seen them hold one of these bunches, and sometimes only two
or three feathers, between the fore finger and thumb, and say a prayer, not one word of which I
could ever understand. Whoever comes to this island, will do well to provide himself with red
feathers, the finest and smallest that are to be got. He must also have a good stock of axes, and
hatchets, spike- nails, files, knives, looking-glasses, beads, &amp;c. Sheets and shirts are much
sought after, especially by the ladies; as many of our gentlemen found by experience.</p><p>The two goats which Captain Furneaux gave to Otoo when we were last here, seemed to promise fair
for answering the end for which they were put on shore. The ewe soon after had two female kids,
which were now so far grown as to be nearly ready to propagate; and the old ewe was again with kid.
The people seemed to be very fond of them, and they to like their situation as well; for they were
in excellent condition. From this circumstance we may hope that, in a few years, they will have some
to spare to their neighbours; and by that means they may in time spread over all the isles in this
ocean. The sheep which we left died soon after, excepting one, which we understood was yet alive. We
have also furnished them with a stock of cats; no less than twenty having been given away at this
isle, besides those which were left at Ulietea and Huaheine.</p></div><div type="chapter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N"><head><l>CHAPTER XIV.</l><l><emph rend="italic">The Arrival of the Ship at the Island of Huaheine; with an Account of an
Expedition into the Island, and several other Incidents which happened while she lay there.</emph></l></head><p><date>1774 May</date></p><p>At <time>one o'clock</time> in the <time>afternoon</time>, on the 15th, we anchored in the north entrance of O'Wharre
harbour, in the island of Huaheine; hoisted out the boats, warped into a proper birth, and moored
with the bower and kedge anchor, not quite a cable's length from the shore. While this was doing,
several of the natives made us a visit, amongst whom was old Oree the chief, who brought a hog and
some other articles, which he presented to me, with the usual ceremony.</p><p>Next morning, the natives began to bring us fruit. I returned Oree's visit, and made my present
to him; one article of which was red feathers. Two or three of these the chief took in his right
hand, holding them up between the finger and thumb, and said a prayer, as I understood, which was
little noticed by any present. Two hogs were soon after put into my boat, and he and several of his
friends came on board and dined with us. After dinner Oree gave me to understand what articles would
be most acceptable to him and his friends, which were chiefly axes and nails. Accordingly I gave him
what he asked, and desired he would distribute them to the others, which he did, seemingly to the
satisfaction of every one. A youth about ten or twelve years of age, either his son or grandson,
seemed to be the person of most note, and had the greatest share.</p><p>After the distribution was over, they all returned ashore. Mr Forster and his party being out in
the country botanizing, his servant, a feeble man, was beset by five or six fellows, who would have
stripped him, if that moment one of the party had not come to his assistance; after which they made
off with a hatchet they had got from him.</p><p>On the 17th, I went ashore to look for the chief, in order to complain of the outrage committed
as above; but he was not in the neighbourhood. Being ashore in the <time>afternoon</time>, a person came and told
me Oree wanted to see me. I went with the man, and was conducted to a large house, where the chief
and several other persons of note were assembled in council, as well as I could understand. After I
was seated, and some conversation had passed among them, Oree made a speech, and was answered by
another. I understood no more of either, than just to know it regarded the robbery committed the day
before. The chief then began to assure me, that neither he, nor any one present (which were the
principal chiefs in the neighbourhood) had any hand in it; and desired me to kill, with the guns,
all those which had. I assured him, that I was satisfied that neither he nor those present were at
all concerned in the affair; and that I should do with the fellows as he desired, or any others who
were guilty of the like crimes. Having asked where the fellows were, and desired they would bring
them to me, that I might do with them as he had said, his answer was, they were gone to the
mountains, and he could not get them. Whether this was the case or not, I will not pretend to say. I
knew fair means would never make them deliver them up; and I had no intention to try others. So the
affair dropt, and the council broke up.</p><p>In the evening, some of the gentlemen went to a dramatic entertainment. The piece represented a
girl as running away with us from Otaheite; which was in some degree true; as a young woman had
taken a passage with us down to Ulietea, and happened now to be present at the representation of her
own adventures; which had such an effect upon her, that it was with great difficulty our gentlemen
could prevail upon her to see the play out, or to refrain from tears while it was acting. The piece
concluded with the reception she was supposed to meet with from her friends at her return; which was
not a very favourable one. These people can add little extempore pieces to their entertainments,
when they see occasion. Is it not then reasonable to suppose that it was intended as a satire
against this girl, and to discourage others from following her steps?</p><p>In the morning of the 18th, Oree came on board with a present of fruit, stayed dinner, and in the
<time>afternoon</time> desired to see some great guns fired, shotted, which I complied with. The reason of his
making this request was his hearing, from Oedidee, and our Otaheitean passengers, that we had so
done at their island. The chief would have had us fire at the hills; but I did not approve of that,
lest the shot should fall short and do some mischief. Besides, the effect was better seen in the
water. Some of the petty officers, who had leave to go into the country for their amusement, took
two of the natives with them to be their guides, and to carry their bags, containing nails,
hatchets, &amp;c. the current cash we traded with here; which the fellows made off with in the
following artful manner: The gentlemen had with them two muskets for shooting birds. After a shower
of rain, their guides pointed out some for them to shoot. One of the muskets having missed fire
several times, and the other having gone off, the instant the fellows saw themselves secure from
both, they ran away, leaving the gentlemen gazing after them with so much surprise, that no one had
presence of mind to pursue them.</p><p>The 19th, showery morning; fair <time>afternoon</time>, nothing happened worthy of note.</p><p>Early in the morning of the 20th, three of the officers set out on a shooting party, rather
contrary to my inclination; as I found the natives, at least some of them, were continually watching
every opportunity to rob straggling parties, and were daily growing more daring. About <time>three o'clock</time>
in the <time>afternoon</time>, I got intelligence that they were seized and stripped of every thing they had
about them. Upon this I immediately went on shore with a boat's crew, accompanied by Mr Forster, and
took possession of a large house with all its effects, and two chiefs whom I found in it; but this
we did in such a manner, that they hardly knew what we were about, being unwilling to alarm the
neighbourhood. In this situation I remained till I heard the officers had got back safe, and had all
their things restored to them: Then I quitted the house; and presently after every thing in it was
carried off. When I got on board I was informed of the whole affair by the officers themselves. Some
little insult on their part, induced the natives to seize their guns, on which a scuffle ensued,
some chiefs interfered, took the officers out of the crowd, and caused every thing which had been
taken from them to be restored. This was at a place where we had before been told, that a set of
fellows had formed themselves into a gang, with a resolution to rob every one who should go that
way. It should seem from what followed, that the chief could not prevent this, or put a stop to
these repeated outrages. I did not see him this evening, as he was not come into the neighbourhood
when I went on board; but I learnt from Oedidee that he came soon after, and was so concerned at
what had happened that he wept.</p><p>Day-light no sooner broke upon us on the 21st, than we saw upwards of sixty canoes under sail
going out of the harbour, and steering over for Ulietea. On our enquiring the reason, we were told
that the people in them were <emph rend="italic">Eareeois</emph>, and were going to visit their
brethren in the neighbouring isles. One may almost compare these men to free-masons; they tell us
they assist each other when need requires; they seem to have customs among them which they either
will not, or cannot explain. Oedidee told us he was one; Tupia was one; and yet I have not been able
to get any tolerable idea of this set of men, from either of them. Oedidee denies that the children
they have by their mistresses are put to death, as we understood from Tupia and others. I have had
some conversation with Omai on this subject, and find that he confirms every thing that is said upon
it in the narrative of my former voyage.</p><p>Oedidee, who generally slept on shore, came off with a message from Oree, desiring I would land
with twenty-two men, to go with him to chastise the robbers. The messenger brought with him, by way
of assisting his memory, twenty-two pieces of leaves, a method customary amongst them. On my
receiving this extraordinary message, I went to the chief for better information; and all I could
learn of him was, that these fellows were a sort of banditti, who had formed themselves into a body,
with a resolution of seizing and robbing our people wherever they found them, and were now armed for
that purpose: For which reason he wanted me to go along with him, to chastise them. I told him, if I
went they would fly to the mountains; but he said, they were resolved to fight us, and therefore
desired I would destroy both them and their house; but begged I would spare those in the
neighbourhood, as also the canoes and the <emph rend="italic">Whenooa</emph>. By way of securing
these, he presented me with a pig as a peace-offering for the <emph rend="italic">Whenooa</emph>. It
was too small to be meant for any thing but a ceremony of this kind. This sensible old chief could
see (what perhaps none of the others ever thought of) that every thing in the neighbourhood was at
our mercy, and therefore took care to secure them by this method, which I suppose to be of weight
with them. When I returned on board, I considered of the chiefs request, which upon the whole
appeared an extraordinary one. I however resolved to go, lest these fellows should be (by our
refusal) encouraged to commit greater acts of violence; and, as their proceeding would soon reach
Ulietea, where I intended to go next, the people there might be induced to treat us in the same
manner, or worse, they being more numerous. Accordingly I landed with forty-eight men, including
officers, Mr Forster, and some other of the gentlemen. The chief joined us with a few people, and we
began to march, in search of the banditti, in good order. As we proceeded, the chief's party
increased like a snow-ball. Oedidee, who was with us, began to be alarmed, observing that many of
the people in our company were of the very party we were going against, and at last telling us, that
they were only leading us to some place where they could attack us to advantage. Whether there was
any truth in this, or it was only Oedidee's fears, I will not pretend to say. He, however, was the
only person we could confide in. And we regulated our motions according to the information he had
given us. After marching some miles, we got intelligence that the men we were going after had fled
to the mountains; but I think this was not till I had declared to the chief I would proceed no
farther. For we were then about crossing a deep valley, bounded on each side by steep rocks, where a
few men with stones only might have made our retreat difficult, if their intentions were what
Oedidee had suggested, and which he still persisted in. Having come to a resolution to return, we
marched back in the same order as we went, and saw, in several places, people, who had been
following us, coming down from the sides of the hills with their arms in their hands, which they
instantly quitted, and hid in the bushes, when they saw they were discovered by us. This seemed to
prove that there must have been some foundation for what Oedidee had said; but I cannot believe that
the chief had any such design, whatever the people might have. In our return we halted at a
convenient place to refresh ourselves. I ordered the people to bring us some cocoa-nuts, which they
did immediately. Indeed, by this time, I believe many of them wished us on board out of the way; for
although no one step was taken that could give them the least alarm, they certainly were in terror.
Two chiefs brought each of them a pig, a dog, and some young plantain trees, the usual
peace-offerings, and with due ceremony presented them singly to me. Another brought a very large
hog, with which he followed us to the ship. After this we continued our course to the landing-place,
where I caused several vollies to be fired, to convince the natives that we could support a
continual fire. This being done, we all embarked and went on board; and soon after the chief
following, brought with him a quantity of fruit, and sat down with us to dinner. We had scarce dined
before more fruit was brought us by others, and two hogs; so that we were likely to make more by
this little excursion than by all the presents we had made them. It certainly gave them some alarm
to see so strong a party of men march into their country; and probably gave them a better opinion of
fire-arms than they had before. For I believe they had but an indifferent, or rather contemptible,
idea of muskets in general, having never seen any fired but at birds, &amp;c. by such of our people
as used to straggle about the country, the most of them but indifferent marksmen, losing generally
two shots out of three, their pieces often, missing fire, and being slow in charging. Of all this
they had taken great notice, and concluded, as well they might, that fire-arms were not so terrible
things as they had been taught to believe.</p><p>When the chiefs took leave in the evening, they promised to bring us next day a very large supply
of provisions. In the article of fruit they were as good as their word, but of hogs, which we most
wanted, they brought far less than we expected. Going ashore in the <time>afternoon</time>, I found the chief
just sitting down to dinner. I cannot say what was the occasion of his dining so late. As soon as he
was seated, several people began chewing the pepper-root; about a pint of the juice of which,
without any mixture, was the first dish, and was dispatched in a moment. A cup of it was presented
to me; but the manner of brewing it was at this time sufficient. Oedidee was not so nice, but took
what I refused. After this the chief washed his mouth with cocoa-nut water; then he eat of repe,
plantain, and mahee, of each not a little; and, lastly, finished his repast by eating, or rather
drinking, about three pints of <emph rend="italic">popoie</emph>, which is made of bread-fruit,
plantains, mahee, &amp;c. beat together and diluted with water till it is of the consistence of a
custard. This was at the outside of his house, in the open air; for at this time a play was acting
within, as was done almost every day in the neighbourhood; but they were such poor performances that
I never attended. I observed that, after the juice had been squeezed out of the chewed pepper-root
for the chief, the fibres were carefully picked up and taken away by one of his servants. On my
asking what he intended to do with it, I was told he would put water to it, and strain it again.
Thus he would make what I will call small beer.</p><p>The 23d, wind easterly, as it had been ever since we left Otaheite. Early in the morning, we
unmoored, and at eight weighed and put to sea. The good old chief was the last man who went out of
the ship. At parting I told him we should see each other no more; at which he wept, and said, "Let
your sons come, we will treat them well." Oree is a good man, in the utmost sense of the word; but
many of the people are far from being of that disposition, and seem to take advantage of his old
age; Teraderre, his grandson and heir, being yet but a youth. The gentle treatment the people of
this isle ever met with from me, and the careless and imprudent manner in which many of our people
had rambled about in the country, from a vain opinion that firearms rendered them invincible,
encouraged many at Huaheine to commit acts of violence, which no man at Otaheite ever durst
attempt.</p><p>During our stay here we got bread-fruit, cocoa-nuts, &amp;c. more than we could well-consume, but
not hogs enough by far to supply our daily expence; and yet it did not appear that they were scarce
in the isle. It must be allowed, however, that the number we took away, when last here, must have
thinned them greatly, and at the same time stocked the isle with our articles. Besides, we now
wanted a proper assortment of trade; what we had being nearly exhausted, and the few remaining red
feathers being here but of little value, when compared to the estimation they stand in at Otaheite.
This obliged me to set the smiths to work to make different sorts of iron tools, nails, &amp;c. in
order to enable me to procure refreshments at the other isles, and to support my credit and
influence among the natives.</p></div><div type="chapter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N"><head><l>CHAPTER XV.</l><l><emph rend="italic">Arrival at Ulietea; with an Account of the Reception we met with there, and the

Ulietea. Oree took the opportunity to send a man with a message to Opoony. Being little wind all the
latter part of the day, it was dark before we reached the west side of the isle, where we spent the
night. The same light variable wind continued till <time>ten o'clock</time> next morning, when the trade-wind at
east prevailed, and we ventured to ply up to the harbour, first sending a boat to lie in anchorage
in the entrance. After making a few trips, we got before the channel, and with all our sails set,
and the head-way the ship had acquired, shut her in as far as she would go; then dropped the anchor,
and took in the sails. This is the method of getting into most of the harbours which are on the
lee-side of these isles; for the channels, in general, are too narrow to ply in: We were now
anchored between the two points of the reef which form the entrance; each not more than two-thirds
the length of a cable from us, and on which the sea broke with such height and violence, as to
people less acquainted with the place, would have been terrible. Having all our boats out with
anchors and warps in them, which were presently run out, the ship warped into safety, where we dropt
anchor for the night. While this work was going forward, my old friend Oree the chief, and several
more, came to see us. The chief came not empty.</p><p>Next day we warped the ship into a proper birth, and moored her, so as to command all the shores
around us. In the mean time a party of us went ashore to pay the chief a visit, and to make the
customary present. At our first entering his house, we were met by four or five old women, weeping
and lamenting, as it were, most bitterly, and at the same time cutting their heads, with instruments
made of shark's teeth, till the blood ran plentifully down their faces and on their shoulders. What
was still worse, we were obliged to submit to the embraces of these old hags, and by that means were
all besmeared with blood. This ceremony (for it was merely such) being over, they went out, washed
themselves, and immediately after appeared as cheerful as any of the company. Having made some
little stay, and given my present to the chief and his friends, he put a hog and some fruit into my
boat, and came on board with us to dinner. In the <time>afternoon</time>, we had a vast number of people and
canoes about us, from different parts of the island. They all took up their quarters in our
neighbourhood, where they remained feasting for some days. We understood the most of them were <emph rend="italic">Eareeoies</emph>.</p><p>The 26th afforded nothing remarkable, excepting that Mr Forster, in his botanical excursions, saw
a burying-place for dogs, which they called <emph rend="italic">Marai no te Oore</emph>. But I think
we ought not to look upon this as one of their customs; because few dogs die a natural death, being
generally, if not always, killed and eaten, or else given as an offering to the gods. Probably this
might be a <emph rend="italic">Marai</emph> or altar, where this sort of offering was made; or it
might have been the whim of some person to have buried his favourite dog in this manner. But be it
as it will, I cannot think it is a general custom in the nation; and, for my own part, I neither saw
nor heard of any such thing before.</p><p>Early in the morning of the 27th, Oree, his wife, son, daughter, and several more of his friends,
made us a visit, and brought with them a good quantity of all manner of refreshments; little having
as yet been got from any body else. They staid dinner; after which a party of us accompanied them on
shore, where we were entertained with a play, called <emph rend="italic">Mididij Harramy</emph>,
which signifies the <emph rend="italic">Child is coming</emph>. It concluded with the representation
of a woman in labour, acted by a set of great brawny fellows, one of whom at last brought forth a
strapping boy, about six feet high, who ran about the stage, dragging after him a large wisp of
straw which hung by a string from his middle. I had an opportunity of seeing this acted another
time, when I observed, that the moment they had got hold of the fellow who represented the child,
they flattened or pressed his nose. From this I judged, that they do so by their children when born,
which may be the reason why all in general have flat noses. This part of the play, from its newness,
and the ludicrous manner in which it was performed, gave us, the first time we saw it, some
entertainment, and caused a loud laugh, which might be the reason why they acted it so often
afterwards. But this, like all their other pieces, could entertain us no more than once; especially
as we could gather little from them, for want of knowing more of their language.</p><p>The 28th was spent by me in much the same manner as the preceding day, viz. in entertaining my
friends, and being entertained by them. Mr Forster and his party in the country botanizing.</p><p>Next morning, we found several articles had been stolen, out of our boats lying at the buoy,
about sixty or seventy yards from the ship. As soon as I was informed of it, I went to the chief to
acquaint him therewith. I found that he not only knew they were stolen, but by whom, and where they
were; and he went immediately with me in my boat in pursuit of them. After proceeding a good way
along shore, towards the south end of the island, the chief ordered us to land near some houses,
where we did not wait long before all the articles were brought to us, except the pinnace's iron
tiller, which I was told was still farther off. But when I wanted to go after it, I found the chief
unwilling to proceed; and he actually gave me the slip; and retired into the country. Without him I
knew I could do nothing. The people began to be alarmed when they saw I was for going farther; by
which I concluded that the tiller was out of their reach also. I therefore sent one of them to the
chief to desire him to return. He returned accordingly; when we sat down, and had some victuals set
before us, thinking perhaps that, as I had not breakfasted, I must be hungry, and not in a good
humour. Thus I was amused, till two hogs were produced, which they entreated me to accept. This I
did, and then their fears vanished; and I thought myself not ill off, in having gotten two good hogs
for a thing which seemed to be quite out of my reach. Matters being thus settled, we returned on
board, and had the company of the chief and his son to dinner. After that we all went ashore, where
a play was acted for the entertainment of such as would spend their time in looking at it. Besides
these plays, which the chief caused frequently to be acted, there was a set of strolling players in
the neighbourhood, who performed everyday. But their pieces seemed to be so much alike, that we soon
grew tired of them; especially as we could not collect any interesting circumstances from them. We,
our ship, and our country, were frequently brought on the stage; but on what account I know not. It
can hardly be doubted, that this was designed as a compliment to us, and probably not acted but when
some of us were present. I generally appeared at Oree's theatre towards the close of the play, and
twice at the other, in order to give my mite to the actors. The only actress at Oree's theatre was
his daughter, a pretty brown girl, at whose shrine, on these occasions, many offerings were made by
her numerous votaries. This, I believe, was one great inducement to her father's giving us these
entertainments so often.</p><p>Early in the morning of the 30th, I set out with the two boats, accompanied by the two Mr
Forsters; Oedidee, the chief, his wife, son, and daughter, for an estate which Oedidee called his,
situated at the north end of the island. There I was promised to have hogs and fruit in abundance;
but when we came there, we found that poor Oedidee could not command one single thing, whatever
right he might have to the <emph rend="italic">Whenooa</emph>, which was now in possession of his
brother, who, soon after we landed, presented to me, with the usual ceremony, two pigs. I made him a
very handsome present in return, and Oedidee gave him every thing he had left of what he had
collected during the time he was with us.</p><p>After this ceremony was over, I ordered one of the pigs to be killed and dressed for dinner, and
attended myself to the whole operation, which was as follows:—They first strangled the hog, which
was done by three men; the hog being placed on his back, two of them laid a pretty strong stick
across his throat, and pressed with all their might on each end; the third man held his hind legs,
kept him on his back, and plugged up his fundament with grass, I suppose to prevent any air from
passing or repassing that way. In this manner they held him for about ten minutes before he was
quite dead. In the mean time, some hands were employed in making a fire, to heat the oven, which was
close by. As soon as the hog was quite dead, they laid him on the fire, and burnt or singed the
hair, so that it came off with almost the same ease as if it had been scalded. As the hair was got
off one part, another was applied to the fire till they had got off the whole, yet not so clean but
that another operation was necessary; which was to carry it to the sea side, and there give it a
good scrubbing with sandy stones, and sand. This brought off all the scurf, &amp;c. which the fire
had left on. After well washing off the sand and dirt, the carcase was brought again to the former
place, and laid on clean green leaves, in order to be opened. They first ripped up the skin of the
belly, and took out the fat or lard from between the skin and the flesh, which they laid on a large
green leaf. The belly was then ripped open, and the entrails taken out, and carried away in a
basket, so that I know not what became of them; but am certain they were not thrown away. The blood
was next taken out, and put into a large leaf, and then the lard, which was put to the other fat.
The hog was now washed clean, both inside and out, with fresh water, and several hot stones put into
his belly, which were shaken in under the breast, and green leaves crammed in upon them. By this
time the oven was sufficiently heated; what fire remained was taken away, together with some of the
hot stones; the rest made a kind of pavement in the bottom of the hole or oven, and were covered
with leaves, on which the hog was placed on his belly. The lard and fat, after being washed with
water, were put into a vessel, made just then of the green bark of the plantain tree, together with
two or three hot stones, and placed on one side the hog. A hot stone was put to the blood, which was
tied up in the leaf, and put into the oven; as also bread-fruit and plantains. Then the whole was
covered with green leaves, on which were laid the remainder of the hot stones; over them were
leaves; then any sort of rubbish they could lay their hands on; finishing the operation by well
covering the whole with earth. While the victuals were baking, a table was spread with green leaves
on the floor, at one end of a large boat-house. At the close of two hours and ten minutes, the oven
was opened, and all the victuals taken out. Those of the natives who dined with us, sat down by
themselves, at one end of the table, and we at the other. The hog was placed before us, and the fat
and blood before them, on which they chiefly dined, and said it was <emph rend="italic">Mamity</emph>, very good victuals; and we not only said, but thought, the same of the pork. The hog
weighed about fifty pounds. Some parts about the ribs I thought rather overdone, but the more fleshy
parts were excellent; and the skin, which by the way of our dressing can hardly be eaten, had, by
this method, a taste and flavour superior to any thing I ever met with of the kind. I have now only
to add, that during the whole of the various operations, they exhibited a cleanliness well worthy of
imitation. I have been the more particular in this account, because I do not remember that any of us
had seen the whole process before; nor is it well described in the narrative of my former
voyage.</p><p>While dinner was preparing, I took a view of this <emph rend="italic">Whenooa</emph> of Oedidee.
It was a small, but a pleasant spot; and the houses were so disposed as to form a very pretty
village, which is very rarely the case at these isles, Soon after we had dined, we set out for the
ship, with the other pig, and a few races of plantains, which proved to be the sum total of our
great expectations.</p><p>In our return to the ship, we put ashore at a place where, in the corner of a house, we saw four
wooden images, each two feet long, standing on a shelf, having a piece of cloth round their middle,
and a kind of turban on their heads, in which were stuck long feathers of cocks. A person in the
house told us they were <emph rend="italic">Eatua no te Toutou</emph>, gods of the servants or
slaves. I doubt if this be sufficient to conclude that they pay them divine worship, and that the
servants or slaves are not allowed the same gods as men of more elevated rank; I never heard that
Tupia made any such distinction, or that they worshipped any visible thing whatever. Besides, these
were the first wooden gods we had seen in any of the isles; and all the authority we had for their
being such, was the bare word of perhaps a superstitious person, and whom, too, we were liable to
misunderstand. It must be allowed that the people of this isle are in general more superstitious
than at Otaheite. At the first visit I made the chief after our arrival, he desired I would not
suffer any of my people to shoot herons and wood-peckers; birds as sacred with them as
robin-red-breasts, swallows, &amp;c. are with many old women in England. Tupia, who was a priest,
and well acquainted with their religion, customs, traditions, &amp;c. paid little or no regard to
these birds. I mention this, because some amongst us were of opinion that these birds are their
<emph rend="italic">Eatuas</emph>, or gods. We indeed fell into this opinion when I was here in
1769, and into some others still more absurd, which we had undoubtedly adopted, if Tupia had not
undeceived us. A man of his knowledge and understanding we have not since met with, and consequently
have added nothing to his account of their religion but superstitious notions.</p><p>On the 31st, the people knowing that we should sail soon, began to bring more fruit on board than
usual. Among those who came was a young man who measured six feet four inches and six-tenths; and
his sister, younger, than him, measured five feet ten inches and a half.</p><p><date>1774 June</date></p><p>A brisk trade for hogs and fruit continued on the 1st of June. On the 2d, in the <time>afternoon</time>, we
got intelligence that, three days before, two ships had arrived at Huaheine. The same report said,
the one was commanded by Mr Banks, and the other by Captain Furneaux. The man who brought the
account said, he was made drunk on board one of them, and described the persons of Mr Banks and
Captain Furneaux so well, that I had not the least doubt of the truth, and began to consider about
sending a boat over that very evening with orders to Captain Furneaux, when a man, a friend of Mr
Forster, happened to come on board and denied the whole, saying it was <emph rend="italic">wà
warre</emph>, a lie. The man from whom we had the intelligence was now gone, so that we could not
confront them, and there were none else present who knew any thing about it but by report; so that I
laid aside sending over a boat till I should be better informed. This evening we entertained the
people with fire-works, on one of the little isles near the entrance of the harbour.</p><p>I had fixed on the next day for sailing, but the intelligence from Huaheine put a stop to it. The
chief had promised to bring the man on board who first brought the account; but he was either not to
be found, or would not appear. In the morning, the people were divided in their opinions; but in the
<time>afternoon</time>, all said it was a false report. I had sent Mr Clerke, in the morning, to the farthest
part of the island, to make enquiries there; he returned without learning any thing satisfactory. In
short, the report appeared now too ill founded to authorize me to send a boat over, or to wait any
longer here; and therefore, early in the morning of the 4th, I got every thing in readiness to sail.
Oree the chief, and his whole family, came on board, to take their last farewell, accompanied by
Oo-oo-rou, the <emph rend="italic">Earee di hi</emph>, and Boba, the <emph rend="italic">Earee</emph> of Otaha, and several of their friends. None of them came empty; but Oo-oo-rou brought
a pretty large present, this being his first and only visit. I distributed amongst them almost every
thing I had left. The very hospitable manner in which I had ever been received by these people, had
endeared them to me, and given them a just title to everything in my power to grant. I questioned
them again about the ships at Huaheine; and they all, to a man, denied that any were there. During
the time these people remained on board, they were continually importuning me to return. The chief,
his wife and daughter, but especially the two latter, scarcely ever ceased weeping. I will not
pretend to say whether it was real or feigned grief they shewed on this occasion. Perhaps there was
a mixture of both; but were I to abide by my own opinion only, I should believe it was real. At
last, when we were about to weigh, they took a most affectionate leave. Oree's last request was for
me to return; when he saw he could not obtain that promise, he asked the name of my <emph rend="italic">Marai</emph> (burying-place). As strange a question as this was, I hesitated not a
moment to tell him Stepney; the parish in which I live when in London. I was made to repeat it
several times over till they could pronounce it; then, Stepney <emph rend="italic">Marai no
Toote</emph> was echoed through an hundred mouths at once. I afterwards found the same question had
been put to Mr Forster by a man on shore; but he gave a different, and indeed more proper answer, by
saying, no man, who used the sea, could say where he should be buried. It is the custom, at these
isles, for all the great families to have burial-places of their own, where their remains are
interred. These go with the estate to the next heir. The <emph rend="italic">Marai</emph> at Oparee
in Otaheite, when Tootaha swayed the sceptre, was called <emph rend="italic">Marai no
Tootaha</emph>; but now it is called <emph rend="italic">Marai no Otoo</emph>. What greater proof
could we have of these people esteeming us as friends, than their wishing to remember us, even
beyond the period of our lives? They had been repeatedly told that we should see them no more; they
then wanted to know where we were to mingle with our parent dust. As I could not promise, or even
suppose, that more English ships would be sent to those isles, our faithful companion Oedidee chose
to remain in his native country. But he left us with a regret fully demonstrative of the esteem he
bore to us; nor could any thing but the fear of never returning, have torn him from us. When the
chief teased me so much about returning, I sometimes gave such answers as left them hopes. Oedidee
would instantly catch at this, take me on one side, and ask me over again. In short, I have not
words to describe the anguish which appeared in this young man's breast when he went away. He looked
up at the ship, burst into tears, and then sunk down into the canoe. The maxim, that a prophet has
no honour in his own country, was never more fully verified than in this youth. At Otaheite he might
have had any thing that was in their power to bestow; whereas here he was not in the least noticed.
He was a youth of good parts, and, like most of his countrymen, of a docile, gentle, and humane
disposition, but in a manner wholly ignorant of their religion, government, manners, customs, and
traditions; consequently no material knowledge could have been gathered from him, had I brought him
away. Indeed, he would have been a better specimen of the nation, in every respect, than Omai. Just
as Oedidee was going out of the ship, he asked me to <emph rend="italic">Tatou</emph> some <emph rend="italic">Parou</emph> for him, in order to shew the commanders of any other ships which might
stop here. I complied with his request, gave him a certificate of the time he had been with us, and
recommended him to the notice of those who might afterwards touch at the island.</p><p>We did not get clear of our friends till <time>eleven o'clock</time>, when we weighed, and put to sea; but
Oedidee did not leave us till we were almost out of the harbour. He staid, in order to fire some
guns; for it being his majesty's birthday, we fired the salute at going away.</p><p>When I first came to these islands, I had some thought of visiting Tupia's famous Bolabola. But
as I had now got on board a plentiful supply of all manner of refreshments, and the route I had in
view allowing me no time to spare, I laid this design aside, and directed my course to the west;
taking our final leave of these happy isles, on which benevolent Nature has spread her luxuriant
sweets with a lavish hand. The natives, copying the bounty of Nature, are equally liberal;
contributing plentifully and cheerfully to the wants of navigators. During the six weeks we had
remained at them, we had fresh pork, and all the fruits which were in season, in the utmost
profusion; besides fish at Otaheite, and fowls at the other isles. All these articles we got in
exchange for axes, hatchets, nails, chissels, cloth, red feathers, beads, knives, scissars,
looking-glasses, &amp;c. articles which will ever be valuable here. I ought not to omit shirts as a
very capital article in making presents; especially with those who have any connexion with the fair
sex. A shirt here is full as necessary as a piece of gold in England. The ladies at Otaheite, after
they had pretty well stripped their lovers of shirts, found a method of clothing themselves with
their own cloth. It was their custom to go on shore every morning, and to return on board in the
evening, generally clad in rags. This furnished a pretence to importune the lover for better
clothes; and when he had no more of his own, he was to dress them in new cloth of the country, which
they always left ashore; and appearing again in rags, they must again be clothed. So that the same
suit might pass through twenty different hands, and be as often sold, bought, and given away.</p><p>Before I finish this account of these islands, it is necessary to mention all I know concerning
the government of Ulietea and Otaha. Oree, so often mentioned, is a native of Bolabola; but is
possessed of <emph rend="italic">Whenooas</emph> or lands at Ulietea; which I suppose he, as well as
many of his countrymen, got at the conquest. He resides here as Opoony's lieutenant; seeming to be
vested with regal authority, and to be the supreme magistrate in the island. Oo-oo-rou, who is the
<emph rend="italic">Earee</emph> by hereditary right, seems to have little more left him than the
bare title, and his own <emph rend="italic">Whenooa</emph> or district, in which I think he is
sovereign. I have always seen Oree pay him the respect due to his rank; and he was pleased when he
saw me distinguish him from others.</p><p>Otaha, so far as I can find, is upon the very same footing. Boba and Ota are the two chiefs; the
latter I have not seen; Boba is a stout, well-made young man; and we were told is, after Opoony's
death, to marry his daughter, by which marriage he will be vested with the same regal authority as
Opoony has now; so that it should seem, though a woman may be vested with regal dignity, she cannot
have regal power. I cannot find that Opoony has got any thing to himself by the conquest of these
isles, any farther than providing for his nobles, who have seized on best part of the lands. He
seems to have no demand on them for any of the many articles they have had from us. Oedidee has
several times enumerated to me all the axes, nails, &amp;c. which Opoony is possessed of, which
hardly amount to as many as he had from me when I saw him in 1769. Old as this famous man is, he
seems not to spend his last days in indolence. When we first arrived here, he was at Maurana; soon
after he returned to Bolabola; and we were now told, he was gone to Tubi.</p><p>I shall conclude this account of these islands, with some observations on the watch which Mr
Wales hath communicated to me. At our arrival in Matavai Bay in Otaheite, the longitude pointed out
by the watch was 2° 8' 38" ½ too far to the west; that is, it had gained, since our leaving Queen
Charlotte's Sound, of its then rate of going, 8' 34.5". This was in about five months, or rather
more, during which time it had passed through the extremes of cold and heat. It was judged that half
this error arose after we left Easter Island; by which it appeared that it went better in the cold
than in the hot climates.</p><p>END VOLUME I.</p></div></div><div type="book"><head><l>A VOYAGE TOWARDS THE SOUTH POLE, AND ROUND THE WORLD.</l><l>BOOK III.</l><l>FROM ULIETEA TO NEW ZEALAND.</l></head><div type="chapter"><head><l>CHAPTER I.</l><l><emph>Passage from Ulietea to the Friendly Isles, with a Description of several Islands that were
discovered, and the Incidents which happened in that Track.</emph></l></head><p><date>1774 June</date></p><p>On the 6th, being the day after leaving Ulietea, at <time>eleven o'clock</time> a.m., we saw land bearing
N.W., which, upon a nearer approach, we found to be a low reef island about four leagues in compass,
and of a circular form. It is composed of several small patches connected together by breakers, the
largest lying on the N.E. part. This is Howe Island, discovered by Captain Wallis, who, I think,
sent his boat to examine it; and, if I have not been misinformed, found a channel through, within
the reef, near the N.W. part. The inhabitants of Ulietea speak of an uninhabited island about this
situation, called by them Mopeha, to which they go at certain seasons for turtle. Perhaps, this may
be the same; as we saw no signs of inhabitants upon it. Its latitude is <geo select="lat">16° 46' S</geo>. longitude <geo select="lon">154° 8'
W</geo>.</p><p>From this day to the 16th, we met nothing remarkable, and our course was west southerly; the
winds variable from north round by the east to S.W., attended with cloudy, rainy, unsettled weather,
and a southerly swell. We generally brought-to, or stood upon a wind during night; and in the day
made all the sail we could. About half an hour after sun-rise this morning, land was seen from the
top-mast head, bearing N.N.E. We immediately altered the course, and steering for it, found it to be
another reef island, composed of five or six woody islets, connected together by sand-banks and
breakers inclosing a lake, into which we could see no entrance. We ranged the west and N.W. coasts,
from its southern to its northern-extremity, which is about two leagues, and so near the shore, that
at one time we could see the rocks under us; yet we found no anchorage, nor saw we any signs of
inhabitants. There were plenty of various kinds of birds, and the coast seemed to abound with fish.
The situation of this isle is not very distant from that assigned by Mr Dalrymple for La Sagitaria,
discovered by Quiros; but, by the description the discoverer has given of it, it cannot be the same.
For this reason, I looked upon it as a new discovery, and named it Palmerston Island, in honour of
Lord Palmerston, one of the lords of the Admiralty. It is situated in latitude <geo select="lat">18° 4' S</geo>. longitude
<geo select="lon">163° 10' W</geo>.</p><p>At <time>four o'clock</time> in the <time>afternoon</time>, we left this isle, and resumed our course to the W. by S. with
a fine steady gale easterly, till <time>noon</time> on the 20th, at which time, being in latitude <geo select="lat">18° 50' S</geo>,
longitude <geo select="lon">168° 52, W</geo>e thought we saw land to S.S.W. and hauled up for it accordingly. But two hours
after, we discovered our mistake, and resumed our course W. by S. Soon after, we saw land from the
mast-head in the same direction; and, as we drew nearer, found it to be an island, which, at five
o'clock, bore west, distant five leagues. Here we spent the night plying under the topsails; and at
day-break next morning, bore away, steering to the northern point, and ranging the west coast at the
distance of one mile, till near <time>noon</time>. Then perceiving some people on the shore, and landing seeming
to be easy, we brought-to, and hoisted out two boats, with which I put off to the land, accompanied
by some of the officers and gentlemen. As we drew near the shore, some of the inhabitants, who were
on the rocks, retired to the woods, to meet us, as we supposed; and we afterwards found our
conjectures right. We landed with ease in a small creek, and took post on a high rock to prevent a
surprise. Here we displayed our colours, and Mr Forster and his party began to collect plants, etc.
The coast was so over-run with woods, bushes, plants, stones, etc. that we could not see forty yards
round us. I took two men, and with them entered a kind of chasm, which opened a way into the woods.
We had not gone far before we heard the natives approaching; upon which I called to Mr Forster to
retire to the party, as I did likewise. We had no sooner joined than the islanders appeared at the
entrance of a chasm not a stone's throw from us. We began to speak, and make all the friendly signs
we could think of, to them, which they answered by menaces; and one of two men, who were advanced
before the rest, threw a stone, which struck Mr Sparrman on the arm. Upon this two muskets were
fired, without order, which made them all retire under cover of the woods; and we saw them no
more.</p><p>After waiting for some little time, and till we were satisfied nothing was to be done here, the
country being so overrun with bushes, that it was hardly possible to come to parley with them, we
embarked and proceeded down along shore, in hopes of meeting with better success in another place.
After ranging the coast for some miles, without seeing a living soul, or any convenient
landing-place, we at length came before a small beach, on which lay four canoes. Here we landed by
means of a little creek, formed by the flat rocks before it, with a view of just looking at the
canoes, and to leave some medals, nails, etc. in them; for not a soul was to be seen. The situation
of this place was to us worse than the former. A flat rock lay next the sea; behind it a narrow
stone beach; this was bounded by a perpendicular rocky cliff of unequal height, whose top was
covered with shrubs; two deep and narrow chasms in the cliff seemed to open a communication into the
country. In or before one of these lay the four canoes which we were going to look at; but in the
doing of this, I saw we should be exposed to an attack from the natives, if there were any, without
being in a situation proper for defence. To prevent this, as much as could be, and to secure a
retreat in case of an attack, I ordered the men to be drawn up upon the rock, from whence they had a
view of the heights; and only myself, and four of the gentlemen, went up to the canoes. We had been
there but a few minutes, before the natives, I cannot say how many, rushed down the chasm out of the
wood upon us. The endeavours we used to bring them to a parley, were to no purpose; for they came
with the ferocity of wild boars, and threw their darts. Two or three muskets, discharged in the air
did not hinder one of them from advancing still farther, and throwing another dart, or rather a
spear, which passed close over my shoulder. His courage would have cost him his life, had not my
musket missed fire; for I was not five paces from him when he threw his spear, and had resolved to
shoot him to save myself. I was glad afterwards that it happened as it did. At this instant, our men
on the rock began to fire at others who appeared on the heights, which abated the ardour of the
party we were engaged with, and gave us time to join our people, when I caused the firing to cease.
The last discharge sent all the islanders to the woods, from whence they did not return so long as
we remained. We did not know that any were hurt. It was remarkable, that when I joined our party, I
tried my musket in the air, and it went off as well as a piece could do. Seeing no good was to be
got with these people, or at the isle, as having no port, we returned on board, and having hoisted
in the boats, made sail to the W.S.W. I had forgot to mention in its proper order, that having put
ashore a little before we came to this last place, three or four of us went upon the cliffs, where
we found the country, as before, nothing but coral rocks, all over-run with bushes, so that it was
hardly possible to penetrate into it; and we embarked again with intent to return directly on board,
till we saw the canoes; being directed to the place by the opinion of some of us, who thought they
heard some people.</p><p>The conduct and aspect of these islanders occasioned my naming it Savage Island. It is situated
in the latitude <geo select="lat">19° 1' S</geo>. longitude <geo select="lon">169° 37' W</geo>. It is about eleven leagues in circuit; of a round
form, and good height; and hath deep waters close to its shores. All the sea-coast, and as far
inland as we could see, is wholly covered with trees, shrubs, etc.; amongst which were some
cocoa-nut trees; but what the interior parts may produce we know not. To judge of the whole garment
by the skirts, it cannot produce much; for so much as we saw of it consisted wholly of coral rocks,
all over-run with woods and bushes. Not a bit of soil was to be seen; the rocks alone supplying the
trees with humidity. If these coral rocks were first formed in the sea by animals, how came they
thrown up to such an height? Has this island been raised by an earthquake? Or has the sea receded
from it? Some philosophers have attempted to account for the formation of low isles, such as are in
the sea; but I do not know that any thing has been said of high islands, or such as I have been
speaking of. In this island, not only the loose rocks which cover the surface, but the cliffs which
bound the shores, are of coral stone, which the continual beating of the sea has formed into a
variety of curious caverns, some of them very large: The roof or rock over them being supported by
pillars, which the foaming waves have formed into a multitude of shapes, and made more curious than
the caverns themselves. In one we saw light was admitted through a hole at the top; in another
place, we observed that the whole roof of one of these caverns had sunk in, and formed a kind of
valley above, which lay considerably below the circumjacent rocks.</p><p>I can say but little of the inhabitants, who, I believe, are not numerous. They seemed to be
stout well-made men, were naked except round the waists, and some of them had their faces, breasts,
and thighs painted black. The canoes were precisely like those of Amsterdam; with the addition of a
little rising like a gunwale on each side of the open part; and had some carving about them, which
shewed that these people are full as ingenious. Both these islanders and their canoes agree very
well with the description M. de Bougainville has given of those he saw off the Isle of Navigators,
which lies nearly under the same meridian.</p><p>After leaving Savage Island, we continued to steer W.S.W. with a fine easterly trade-wind, till
the 24th in the evening, when, judging ourselves not far from Rotterdam, we brought-to, and spent
the night plying under the top-sails. At daybreak next morning, we bore away west; and soon after,
saw a string of islands extending from S.S.W. by the west to N.N.W. The wind being at N.E., we
hauled to N.W., with a view of discovering more distinctly the isles in that quarter; but, presently
after, we discovered a reef of rocks a-head, extending on each bow farther than we could see. As we
could not weather them, it became necessary to tack and bear up to the south, to look for a passage
that way. At <time>noon</time> the southernmost island bore S.W., distant four miles. North of this isle were
three others, all connected by breakers, which we were not sure did not join to those we had seen in
the morning, as some were observed in the intermediate space. Some islands were also seen to the
west of those four; but Rotterdam was not yet in sight. Latitude <geo select="lat">20° 23' S</geo>. longitude <geo select="lon">174° 6' W</geo>.
During the whole <time>afternoon</time>, we had little wind; so that at sunset, the southernmost isle bore
W.N.W., distant five miles; and some breakers, we had seen to the south, bore now S.S.W. 1/2 W. Soon
after it fell calm, and we were left to the mercy of a great easterly swell; which, however,
happened to have no great effect upon the ship. The calm continued till <time>four o'clock</time> the next
morning, when it was succeeded by a breeze from the south. At day-light, perceiving a likelihood of
a passage between the islands to the north and the breakers to the south, we stretched in west, and
soon after saw more islands, both to the S.W. and N.W., but the passage seemed open and clear. Upon
drawing near the islands, we sounded, and found forty-five and forty fathoms, a clear sandy bottom.
I was now quite easy, since it was in our power to anchor, in case of a calm; or to spend the night,
if we found no passage. Towards <time>noon</time> some canoes came off to us from one of the isles, having two or
three people in each; who advanced boldly alongside, and exchanged some cocoa-nuts, and shaddocks,
for small nails. They pointed out to us Anamocka, or Rotterdam; an advantage we derived from knowing
the proper names. They likewise gave us the names of some of the other isles, and invited us much to
go to theirs, which they called Cornango. The breeze freshening, we left them astern, and steered
for Anamocka; meeting with a clear passage, in which we found unequal sounding, from forty to nine
fathoms, depending, I believe, in a great measure, on our distance from the islands which form
it.</p><p>As we drew near the south end of Rotterdam, or Anamocka, we were met by a number of canoes, laden
with fruit and roots; but as I did not shorten sail, we had but little traffic with them. The people
in one canoe enquired for me by name; a proof that these people have an intercourse with those of
Amsterdam. They importuned us much to go towards their coast, letting us know, as we understood
them, that we might anchor there. This was on the S.W. side of the island, where the coast seemed to
be sheltered from the S. and S.E. winds; but as the day was far spent, I could not attempt to go in
there, as it would have been necessary to have sent first a boat to examine it. I therefore stood
for the north side of the island, where we anchored about three-fourths of a mile from shore; the
extremes of it bearing south, <geo select="lon">88° E</geo>. to S.W.; a cove with a sandy beach at the bottom of it S. 50°
E.</p></div><div type="chapter"><head><l>CHAPTER II</l>. <l><emph>Reception at Anamocka; a Robbery and its Consequences, with a

them yams and shaddocks, which they exchanged for small nails and old rags. One man taking a vast
liking to our lead and line, got hold of it, and, in spite of all the threats I could make use of,
cut the line with a stone; but a discharge of small shot made him return it. Early in the morning, I
went ashore with Mr Gilbert to look for fresh water. We landed in the cove above-mentioned, and were
received with great courtesy by the natives. After I had distributed some presents amongst them, I
asked for water, and was conducted to a pond of it that was brackish, about three-fourths of a mile
from the landing-place, which I supposed to be the same that Tasman watered at. In the mean time,
the people in the boat had laden her with fruit and roots, which the natives had brought down, and
exchanged for nails and beads. On our return to the ship, I found the same sort of traffic carrying
on there. After breakfast, I went ashore with two boats to trade with the people, accompanied by
several of the gentlemen, and ordered the launch to follow with casks to be filled with water. The
natives assisted us to roll them to and from the pond; and a nail or a bead was the expence of their
labour. Fruits and roots, especially shaddocks and yams, were brought down in such plenty, that the
two boats were laden, sent off, cleared, and laden a second time, before <time>noon</time>; by which time also
the launch had got a full supply of water, and the botanical and shooting parties had all come in,
except the surgeon, for whom we could not wait, as the tide was ebbing fast out of the cove;
consequently he was left behind. As there is no getting into the cove with a boat, from between
half-ebb to half-flood, we could get off no water in the <time>afternoon</time>. However, there is a very good
landing-place, without it, near the southern point, where boats can get ashore at all times of the
tide. Here some of the officers landed after dinner, where they found the surgeon, who had been
robbed of his gun. Having come down to the shore some time after the boats had put off, he got a
canoe to bring him on board; but, as he was getting into her, a fellow snatched hold of the gun, and
ran off with it. After that no one would carry him to the ship, and they would have stripped him, as
he imagined, had he not presented a tooth-pick case, which they, no doubt, thought was a little gun.
As soon as I heard of this, I landed at the place above-mentioned, and the few natives who were
there fled at my approach. After landing I went in search of the officers, whom I found in the cove,
where we had been in the morning, with a good many of the natives about them. No step had been taken
to recover the gun, nor did I think proper to take any; but in this I was wrong. The easy manner of
obtaining this gun, which they now, no doubt, thought secure in their possession, encouraged them to
proceed in these tricks, as will soon appear. The alarm the natives had caught being soon over, they
carried fruit, etc. to the boats, which got pretty well laden before night, when we all returned on
board.</p><p>Early in the morning of the 28th, Lieutenant Clerke, with the master and fourteen or fifteen men,
went on shore in the launch for water. I did intend to have followed in another boat myself, but
rather unluckily deferred it till after breakfast. The launch was no sooner landed than the natives
gathered about her, behaving in so rude a manner, that the officers were in some doubt if they
should land their casks; but, as they expected me on shore soon, they ventured, and with difficulty
got them filled, and into the boat again. In the doing of this Mr Clerke's gun was snatched from
him, and carried off; as were also some of the cooper's tools; and several of the people were
stripped of one thing or another. All this was done, as it were, by stealth; for they laid hold of
nothing by main force. I landed just as the launch was ready to put off; and the natives, who were
pretty numerous on the beach, as soon as they saw me, fled; so that I suspected something had
happened. However, I prevailed on many to stay, and Mr Clerke came, and informed me of all the
preceding circumstances. I quickly came to a resolution to oblige them to make restitution; and, for
this purpose, ordered all the marines to be armed and sent on shore. Mr Forster and his party being
gone into the country, I ordered two or three guns to be fired from the ship, in order to alarm him;
not knowing how the natives might act on this occasion. These orders being given, I sent all the
boats off but one, with which I staid, having a good many of the natives about me, who behaved with
their usual courtesy. I made them so sensible of my intention, that long before the marines came, Mr
Clerke's musket was brought; but they used many excuses to divert me from insisting on the other. At
length Mr Edgcumbe arriving with the marines, this alarmed them so much, that some fled. The first
step I took was to seize on two large double sailing canoes, which were in the cove. One fellow
making resistance, I fired some small shot at him, and sent him limping off. The natives being now
convinced that I was in earnest, all fled; but on my calling to them, many returned; and, presently
after, the other musket was brought, and laid down at my feet. That moment, I ordered the canoes to
be restored, to shew them on what account they were detained. The other things we had lost being of
less value, I was the more indifferent about them. By this time the launch was ashore for another
turn of water, and we were permitted to fill the casks without any one daring to come near us;
except one man, who had befriended us during the whole affair, and seemed to disapprove of the
conduct of his countrymen.</p><p>On my returning from the pond to the cove, I found a good many people collected together, from
whom we understood that the man I had fired at was dead. This story I treated as improbable, and
addressed a man, who seemed of some consequence, for the restitution of a cooper's adze we had lost
in the morning. He immediately sent away two men, as I thought, for it; but I soon found that we had
greatly mistaken each other; for instead of the adze, they brought the wounded man, stretched out on
a board, and laid him down by me, to all appearance dead. I was much moved at the sight; but soon
saw my mistake, and that he was only wounded in the hand and thigh. I, therefore, desired he might
be carried out of the sun, and sent for the surgeon to dress his wounds. In the mean time, I
addressed several people for the adze; for as I had now nothing else to do, I determined to have it.
The one I applied the most to, was an elderly woman, who had always a great deal to say to me, from
my first landing; but, on this occasion, she gave her tongue full scope. I understood but little of
her eloquence; and all I could gather from her arguments was, that it was mean in me to insist on
the return of so trifling a thing. But when she found I was determined, she and three or four more
women went away; and soon after the adze was brought me, but I saw her no more. This I was sorry
for, as I wanted to make her a present, in return for the part she had taken in all our
transactions, private as well as public. For I was no sooner returned from the pond, the first time
I landed, than this old lady presented to me a girl, giving me to understand she was at my service.
Miss, who probably had received her instructions, wanted, as a preliminary article, a spike-nail or
a shirt, neither of which I had to give her, and soon made them sensible of my poverty. I thought,
by that means, to have come off with flying colours; but I was mistaken; for they gave me to
understand I might retire with her on credit. On my declining this proposal, the old lady began to
argue with me; and then abuse me. Though I comprehended little of what she said, her actions were
expressive enough, and shewed that her words were to this effect, sneering in my face, saying, What
sort of a man are you, thus to refuse the embraces of so fine a young woman? For the girl certainly
did not want beauty; which, however, I could better withstand, than the abuses of this worthy
matron, and therefore hastened into the boat. They wanted me to take the young lady aboard; but this
could not be done, as I had given strict orders, before I went ashore, to suffer no woman, on any
pretence whatever, to come into the ship, for reasons which I shall mention in another place.</p><p>As soon as the surgeon got ashore, he dressed the man's wounds, and bled him; and was of opinion
that he was in no sort of danger, as the shot had done little more than penetrate the skin. In the
operation, some poultice being wanting, the surgeon asked for ripe plantains; but they brought
sugar-cane, and having chewed it to a pulp, gave it him to apply to the wound. This being of a more
balsamic nature than the other; proves that these people have some knowledge of simples. As soon as
the man's wounds were dressed, I made him a present, which his master, or at least the man who owned
the canoe, took, most probably to himself. Matters being thus settled apparently to the satisfaction
of all parties, we repaired on board to dinner, where I found a good supply of fruit and roots, and,
therefore, gave orders to get every thing in readiness to sail.</p><p>I now was informed of a circumstance which was observed on board; several canoes being at the
ship, when the great guns were fired in the morning, they all retired, but one man, who was bailing
the water out of his canoe, which lay alongside directly under the guns. When the first was fired,
he just looked up, and then, quite unconcerned, continued his work. Nor had the second gun any other
effect upon him. He did not stir till the water was all out of his canoe, when he paddled leisurely
off. This man had, several times, been observed to take fruit and roots out of other canoes, and
sell them to us. If the owners did not willingly part with them, he took them by force; by which he
obtained the appellation of custom-house officer. One time, after he had been collecting tribute, he
happened to be lying alongside of a sailing canoe which was on board. One of her people seeing him
look another way, and his attention otherwise engaged, took the opportunity of stealing somewhat out
of his canoe; they then put off, and set their sail. But the man, perceiving the trick they had
played him, darted after them, and having soon got on board their canoe, beat him who had taken his
things, and not only brought back his own, but many other articles which he took from them. This man
had likewise been observed making collections on shore at the trading-place. I remembered to have
seen him there; and, on account of his gathering tribute, took him to be a man of consequence, and
was going to make him a present; but some of their people would not let me, saying he was no
<emph>Areeke</emph> (that is, chief). He had his hair always powdered with some kind of white
dust.</p><p>As we had no wind to sail this <time>afternoon</time>, a party of us went ashore in the evening. We found the
natives everywhere courteous and obliging; so that, had we made a longer stay, it is probable we
should have had no more reason to complain of their conduct. While I was now on shore, I got the
names of twenty islands, which lie between the N.W. and N.E., some of them in sight. Two of them,
which lie most to the west, viz. Amattafoa and Oghao, are remarkable on account of their great
height. In Amattafoa, which is the westernmost, we judged there was a volcano, by the continual
column of smoke we saw daily ascending from the middle of it.</p><p>Both Mr Cooper and myself being on shore at <time>noon</time>, Mr Wales could not wind up the watch at the
usual time; and, as we did not come on board till late in the <time>afternoon</time>, it was forgotten till it
was down. This circumstance was of no consequence, as Mr Wales had had several altitudes of the sun
at this place, before it went down; and also had opportunities of taking some after.</p><p>At day-break on the 29th, having got under sail with a light breeze at west, we stood to the
north for the two high islands; but the wind, scanting upon us, carried us in amongst the low isles
and shoals; so that, we had to ply, to clear them. This gave time for a great many canoes to get up
with us. The people in them brought for traffic various articles; some roots, fruits, and fowls, but
of the latter not many. They took in exchange small nails, and pieces of any kind of cloth. I
believe, before they went away, they stripped the most of our people of the few clothes the ladies
at Otaheite had left them; for the passion for curiosities was as great as ever. Having got clear of
the low isles, we made a stretch to the south, and did but fetch a little to windward of the south
end of Anamocka; so that we got little by this day's plying. Here we spent the night, making short
boards over that space with which we had made ourselves acquainted the preceding day.</p><p>On the 30th at day-break, stretched out for Amattafoa, with a gentle breeze at W.S.W. Day no
sooner dawned than we saw canoes coming from all parts. Their traffic was much the same as it had
been the day before, or rather better; for out of one canoe I got two pigs, which were scarce
articles here. At four in the <time>afternoon</time>, we drew near the island of Amattafoa, and passed between it
and Oghao, the channel being two miles broad, safe, and without soundings. While we were in the
passage, we had little wind and calms. This gave time for a large sailing double canoe, which had
been following us all the day, as well as some others with paddles, to come up with us. I had now an
opportunity to verify a thing I was before in doubt about, which was, whether or no some of these
canoes did not, in changing tacks, only shift the sail, and so proceed with that end foremost, which
before was the stern. The one we now saw wrought in this manner. The sail is latteen, extending to a
latteen yard above, and to a boom at the foot; in one word, it is like a whole mizzen, supposing the
whole foot to be extended to a boom. The yard is slung nearly in the middle, or upon an equipoise.
When they change tacks they throw the vessel up in the wind, ease off the sheet, and bring the heel
or tack-end of the yard to the other end of the boat, and the sheet in like manner; there are
notches, or sockets, at each end of the vessel in which the end of the yard fixes. In short, they
work just as those do at the Ladrone Islands, according to Mr Walter's description*. When they want
to sail large, or before the wind, the yard is taken out of the socket and squared. It most be
observed, that all their sailing vessels are not rigged to sail in the same manner. Some, and those
of the largest size, are rigged, so as to tack about. These have a short but pretty stout mast,
which steps on a kind of roller that is fixed to the deck near the fore-part. It is made to lean or
incline very much forward; the head is forked; on the two points of which the yard rests, as on two
pivots, by means of two strong cleats of wood secured to each side of the yard, at about one-third
its length from the tack or heel, which, when under sail, is confined down between the two canoes,
by means of two strong ropes, one to and passing through a hole at the head of each canoe; for it
must be observed, that all the sailing vessels of this sort are double. The tack being thus fixed,
it is plain that, in changing tacks, the vessels must be put about; the sail and boom on the one
tack will be clear of the mast, and on the other it will lie against it, just as a whole mizzen.
However, I am not sure if they do not sometimes unlace that part of the sail from the yard which is
between the tack and mast-head, and so shift both sail and boom leeward of the mast. The drawings
which Mr Hodges made of these vessels seem to favour this supposition. The outriggers and ropes used
for shrowds, etc. are all stout and strong. Indeed, the sail, yard, and boom, are all together of
such an enormous weight, that strength is required.</p><p>[* See Lord Anson's Voyage.]</p><p>The summit of Amattafoa was hid in the clouds the whole day, so that we were not able to
determine with certainty whether there was a volcano or no; but every thing we could see concurred
to make us believe there was. This island is about five leagues in circuit. Oghao is not so much;
but more round and peaked. They lie in the direction of N.N.W. 1/2 W. from Anamocka, eleven or
twelve leagues distant; they are both inhabited, but neither of them seemed fertile.</p><p>We were hardly through the passage before we got a fresh breeze at south. That moment all the
natives made haste to be gone, and we steered to the west; all sails set. I had some thoughts of
touching at Amsterdam, as it lay not much out of the way; but as the wind was now, we could not
fetch it; and this was the occasion of my laying my design aside altogether.</p><p>Let us now return to Anamocka, as it is called by the natives. It is situated in the latitude of
<geo select="lat">20° 15' S</geo>.; longitude <geo select="lon">174° 31' W</geo>., and was first discovered by Tasman, and by him named Rotterdam.
It is of a triangular form, each side whereof is about three and a half or four miles. A salt-water
lake in the middle of it occupies not a little of its surface, and in a manner cuts off the S.E.
angle. Round the island, that is, from the N.W. to the S., round by the N. and E., lie scattered a
number of small isles, sand-banks, and breakers. We could see no end to their extent to the N.; and
it is not impossible that they reach as far S. as Amsterdam or Tongatabu. These, together with
Middleburg or Eaoowee, and Pylstart, make a group, containing about three degrees of latitude and
two of longitude, which I have named the Friendly Isles or Archipelago, as a firm alliance and
friendship seems to subsist among their inhabitants, and their courteous behaviour to strangers
entitles them to that appellation; under which we might, perhaps, extend their group much farther,
even down to Boscawen and Keppell's Isles discovered by Captain Wallis, and lying nearly under the
same meridian, and in the latitude of <geo select="lat">15° 53' S</geo> ; for, from the little account I have had of the people
of these two isles they seem to have the same sort of friendly disposition we observed in our
Archipelago.</p><p>The inhabitants, productions, etc. of Rotterdam, and the neighbouring isles, are the same as at
Amsterdam. Hogs and fowls are, indeed, much scarcer; of the former having got but six, and not many
of the latter. Yams and shaddocks were what we got the most of; other fruits were not so plenty. Not
half of the isle is laid out in inclosed plantations as at Amsterdam; but the parts which are not
inclosed, are not less fertile or uncultivated. There is, however, far more waste land on this isle,
in proportion to its size, than upon the other; and the people seem to be much poorer; that is, in
cloth, matting, ornaments, etc. which constitute a great part of the riches of the South-Sea
islanders.</p><p>The people of this isle seem to be more affected with the leprosy, or some scrophulous disorder,
than any I have seen elsewhere. It breaks out in the face more than any other part of the body. I
have seen several whose faces were ruined by it, and their noses quite gone. In one of my
excursions, happening to peep into a house where one or more of them were, one man only appeared at
the door, or hole, by which I must have entered, and which he began to stop up, by drawing several
parts of a cord across it. But the intolerable stench which came from his putrid face was alone
sufficient to keep me out, had the entrance been ever so wide. His nose was quite gone, and his
whole face in one continued ulcer; so that the very sight of him was shocking. As our people had not
all got clear of a certain disease they had contracted at the Society Isles, I took all possible
care to prevent its being communicated to the natives here; and I have reason to believe my
endeavours succeeded.</p><p>Having mentioned a house, it may not be amiss to observe, that some here differ from those I saw
at the other isles: being inclosed or walled on every side, with reeds neatly put together, but not
close. The entrance is by a square hole, about two feet and a half each way. The form of these
houses is an oblong square; the floor or foundation every way shorter than the eve, which is about
four feet from the ground. By this construction, the rain that falls on the roof, is carried off
from the wall, which otherwise would decay and rot.</p><p>We did not distinguish any king or leading chief, or any person who took upon him the appearance
of supreme authority. The man and woman before mentioned, whom I believed to be man and wife,
interested themselves on several occasions in our affairs; but it was easy to see they had no great
authority. Amongst other things which I gave them as a reward for their service, was a young dog and
bitch, animals which they have not, but are very fond of, and know very well by name. They have some
of the same sort of earthen pots we saw at Amsterdam; and I am of opinion they are of their own
manufacture, or that of some neighbouring isle.</p><p>The road, as I have already mentioned, is on the north side of the isle, just to the southward of
the southernmost cove; for there are two on this side. The bank is of some extent, and the bottom
free from rocks, with twenty-five and twenty fathoms water, one or two miles from the shore.</p><p>Fire-wood is very convenient to be got at, and easy to be shipped off; but the water is so
brackish that it is not worth the trouble of carrying it on board; unless one is in great distress
for want of that article, and can get no better. There is, however, better, not only on this isle,
but on others in the neighbourhood; for the people brought us some in cocoa-nut shells which was as
good as need be; but probably the springs are too trifling to water a ship.</p><p>I have already observed, that the S.W. side of the island is covered by a reef or reefs of rocks,
and small isles. If there be a sufficient depth of water between them and the island, as there
appeared to be, and a good bottom, this would be a much securer place for a ship to anchor in, than
that where we had our station.</p></div><div type="chapter"><head><l>CHAPTER III.</l><l><emph>The Passage from the Friendly Isles to the New Hebrides, with an Account of the Discovery

Inhabitants, and many other Particulars.</emph></l></head><p><date>1774 July</date></p><p>On the first of July, at sun-rise, Amattafoa was still in sight, bearing N.E., distant twenty
leagues. Continuing our course to the west, we, the next day at <time>noon</time>, discovered land bearing N.W.
by W., for which we steered; and, upon a nearer approach, found it to be a small island. At four
o'clock it bore from N.W. half W. to N.W. by N., and, at the same time, breakers were seen from the
masthead, extending from W. to S.W. The day being too far spent to make farther discoveries, we soon
after shortened sail, hauled the wind, and spent the night, making short boards, which, at
day-break, we found had been so advantageous that we were farther from the island than we expected,
and it was <time>eleven o'clock</time> before we reached the N.W. or lee-side, where anchorage and landing seemed
practicable. In order to obtain a knowledge of the former, I sent the master with a boat to sound,
and, in the mean time, we stood on and off with the ship. At this time four or five people were seen
on the reef, which lies round the isle, and about three times that number on the shore. As the boat
advanced, those on the reef retired and joined the others; and when the boat landed they all fled to
the woods. It was not long before the boat returned, when the master informed me that there were no
soundings without the reef, over which, in one place only, he found a boat channel of six feet
water. Entering by it, he rowed in for the shore, thinking to speak with the people, not more than
twenty in number, who were armed with clubs and spears; but the moment he set his foot on shore,
they retired to the woods. He left on the rocks some medals, nails, and a knife, which they no doubt
found, as some were seen near the place afterwards. This island is not quite a league in length, in
the direction of N.E. and S.W., and not half that in breadth. It is covered with wood, and
surrounded by a reef of coral rocks, which in some places extend two miles from the shore. It seems
to be too small to contain many inhabitants; and probably the few whom we saw, may have come from
some isle in the neighbourhood to fish for turtle; as many were seen near this reef, and occasioned
that name to be given to the island, which is situated in latitude <geo select="lat">19° 48' S</geo>outh, longitude <geo select="lon">178° 21'
W</geo>est.</p><p>Seeing breakers to the S.S.W., which I was desirous of knowing the extent of before night, I left
Turtle Isle, and stood for them. At <time>two o'clock</time> we found they were occasioned by a coral bank, of
about four or five leagues in circuit. By the bearing we had taken, we knew these to be the same
breakers we had seen the preceding evening. Hardly any part of this bank or reef is above water at
the reflux of the waves. The heads of some of the rocks are to be seen near the edge of the reef,
where it is the shoalest; for in the middle is deep water. In short, this bank wants only a few
little islets to make it exactly like one of the half-drowned isles so often mentioned. It lies S.W.
from Turtle Island, about five or six miles, and the channel between it and the reef of that isle is
three miles over. Seeing no more shoals or islands, and thinking there might be turtle on this bank,
two boats were properly equipped and sent thither; but returned without having seen one.</p><p>The boats were now hoisted in, and we made sail to the west, with a brisk gale at east, which
continued till the 9th, when we had for a few hours, a breeze at N.W., attended with squalls of
rain. This was succeeded by a steady fresh gale at S.E., with which we steered N.W., being at this
time in the latitude of <geo select="lat">20° 20' S</geo>. longitude <geo select="lon">176° 8' E</geo>.</p><p>On the 15th at <time>noon</time>, being in the latitude of <geo select="lat">15° 9' S</geo>outh, longitude <geo select="lon">171° 16' E</geo>ast, I steered
west. The next day the weather was foggy, and the wind blew in heavy squalls, attended with rain,
which in this ocean, within the tropics, generally indicates the vicinity of some high land. This
was verified at three in the <time>afternoon</time>, when high land was seen bearing S.W. Upon this we took in
the small sails, reefed the top-sails, and hauling up for it, at half-past five we could see it
extend from S.S.W. to N.N.W. half W. Soon after we tacked and spent the night, which was very
stormy, in plying. Our boards were disadvantageous; for, in the morning, we found we had lost
ground. This, indeed, was no wonder, for having an old suit of sails bent, the most of them were
split to pieces; particularly a fore-top-sail, which was rendered quite useless. We got others to
the yards, and continued to ply, being desirous of getting round the south ends of the lands, or at
least so far to the south as to be able to judge of their extent in that direction. For no one
doubted that this was the Australia del Espiritu Santo of Quiros, which M. de Bougainville calls the
Great Cyclades, and that the coast we were now upon was the east side of Aurora Island, whose
longitude is <geo select="lon">168° 30' E</geo>.</p><p>The gale kept increasing till we were reduced to our low sails; so that, on the 18th, at seven in
the morning, I gave over plying, set the top-sails double-reefed, bore up for, and hauled round the
north end of Aurora Island, and then stretched over for the Isle of Lepers, under close-reefed
topsails and courses, with a very hard gale at N.E.; but we had now the advantage of a smooth sea,
having the Isle of Aurora to windward. At <time>noon</time> the north end of it bore N.E. 1/2 N., distant four
leagues; our latitude, found by double altitudes, and reduced to this time, was <geo select="lat">15° 1' 30" S</geo>outh,
longitude <geo select="lon">168° 14' E</geo>ast. At <time>two o'clock</time> p.m. we drew near the middle of the Isle of Lepers, and
tacked about two miles from land; in which situation we had no soundings with a line of seventy
fathoms. We now saw people on the shore, and many beautiful cascades of water pouring down the
neighbouring hills. The next time we stood for this isle, we came to within half a mile of it, where
we found thirty fathoms a sandy bottom; but a mile off we found no soundings at seventy fathoms.
Here two canoes came off to us, in one of which were three men, and in the other but one. Though we
made all the signs of friendship, we could not bring them nearer than a stone's throw; and they made
but a short stay before they retired ashore, where we saw a great number of people assembled in
parties, and armed with bows and arrows. They were of a very dark colour; and, excepting some
ornaments at their breast and arms, seemed to be entirely naked.</p><p>As I intended to get to the south, in order to explore the land which might lie there, we
continued to ply between the Isle of Lepers and Aurora; and on the 19th, at <time>noon</time>, the south end of
the last-mentioned isle bore south <geo select="lon">24° E</geo>ast, and the north end north, distant twenty miles. Latitude
observed 15° 11'. The wind continued to blow strong at S.E., so that what we got by plying in the
day, we lost in the night. On the 20th, at sun-rise, we found ourselves off the south end of Aurora,
on the N.W. side of which, the coast forms a small bay. In this we made some trips to try for
anchorage; but found no less than eighty fathoms water, the bottom a fine dark sand, at half a mile
from shore. Nevertheless, I am of opinion that, nearer, there is much less depth, and secure riding;
and in the neighbourhood is plenty of fresh water and wood for fuel. The whole isle, from the
sea-shore to the summits of the hills, seemed to be covered with the latter; and every valley
produced a fine stream of the former. We saw people on the shore, and some canoes on the coast, but
none came off to us. Leaving the bay just mentioned, we stretched across the channel which divides
Aurora from Whitsuntide Island. At <time>noon</time> we were abreast the north end of this latter, which bore
E.N.E., and observed in 15° 28' 1/2. The isle of Aurora bore from N. to N.E. 1/2 east, and the Isle
of Lepers from N. by W. 1/2 W. to west. Whitsuntide Isle appeared joined to the land to the S. and
S.W. of it; but in stretching to S.W. we discovered the separation. This was about <time>four o'clock</time>
p.m., and then we tacked and stretched in for the island till near sun-set, when the wind veering
more to the east, made it necessary to resume our course to the south. We saw people on the shore,
smokes in many parts of the island, and several places which seemed to be cultivated. About
midnight, drawing near the south land, we tacked and stretched to the north, in order to spend the
remainder of the night.</p><p>At day-break on the 21st, we found ourselves before the channel that divides Whitsuntide Island
from the south land, which is about two leagues over. At this time, the land to the southward
extended from S. by E. round to the west, farther than the eye could reach, and on the part nearest
to us, which is of considerable height, we observed two very large columns of smoke, which, I
judged, ascended from volcanoes. We now stood S.S.W., with a fine breeze at S.E.; and, at ten
o'clock, discovered this part of the land to be an island, which is called by the natives Ambrym.
Soon after an elevated land appeared open off the south end of Ambrym; and after that, another still
higher, on which is a high peaked hill. We judged these lands to belong to two separate islands. The
first came in sight at S.E.; the second at E. by S., and they appeared to be ten leagues distant.
Holding on our course for the land ahead, at <time>noon</time> it was five miles distant from us, extending from
S.S.E. to N.W. by W., and appeared to be continued. The islands to the east bore from N.E. by E. to
S.E. by E., latitude observed <geo select="lat">16° 17' S</geo>outh. As we drew nearer the shore we discovered a creek,
which had the appearance of being a good harbour, formed by a low point or peninsula, projecting out
to the north. On this a number of people were assembled, who seemed to invite us ashore; probably
with no good intent, as the most of them were armed with bows and arrows. In order to gain room and
time to hoist out and arm our boats, to reconnoitre this place, we tacked and made a trip off, which
occasioned the discovery of another port about a league more to the south. Having sent two armed
boats to sound and look for anchorage, on their making the signal for the latter, we sailed in
S.S.W., and anchored in eleven fathoms water, not two cables' length from the S.E. shore, and a mile
within the entrance.</p><p>We had no sooner anchored than several of the natives came off in canoes. They were very cautious
at first; but, at last, trusted themselves alongside, and exchanged, for pieces of cloth, arrows;
some of which were pointed with bone, and dipped in some green gummy substance, which we naturally
supposed was poisonous. Two men having ventured on board, after a short stay, I sent them away with
presents. Others, probably induced by this, came off by moon-light; but I gave orders to permit none
to come alongside, by which means we got clear of them for the night.</p><p>Next morning early, a good many came round us, some in canoes, and others swimming. I soon
prevailed on one to come on board, which be no sooner did, than he was followed by more than I
desired; so that not only our deck, but rigging, was presently filled with them. I took four into
the cabin, and gave them various articles, which they shewed to those in the canoes, and seemed much
pleased with their reception. While I was thus making friends with those in the cabin, an accident
happened that threw all into confusion, but in the end, I believe, proved advantageous to us. A
fellow in a canoe having been refused admittance into one of our boats that lay alongside, bent his
bow to shoot a poisoned arrow at the boat-keeper. Some of his countrymen prevented his doing it that
instant, and gave time to acquaint me with it. I ran instantly on deck, and saw another man
struggling with him; one of those who had been in the cabin, and had leaped out of the window for
this purpose. The other seemed resolved, shook him off, and directed his bow again to the
boat-keeper; but, on my calling to him, pointed it at me. Having a musquet in my hand loaded with
small shot, I gave him the contents. This staggered him for a moment, but did not prevent him from
holding his bow still in the attitude of shooting. Another discharge of the same nature made him
drop it, and the others, who were in the canoe, to paddle off with all speed. At this time, some
began to shoot arrows on the other side. A musquet discharged in the air had no effect; but a
four-pound shot over their heads sent them off in the utmost confusion. Many quitted their canoes
and swam on shore; those in the great cabin leaped out of the windows; and those who were on the
deck, and on different parts of the rigging, all leaped overboard. After this we took no farther
notice of them, but suffered them to come off and pick up their canoes; and some of them even
ventured alongside of the ship. Immediately after the great gun was fired, we heard the beating of
drums on shore; which was, probably, the signal for the country to assemble in arms. We now got
every thing in readiness to land, to cut some wood, which we were in want of, and to try to get some
refreshments, nothing of this kind having been seen in any of the canoes.</p><p>About <time>nine o'clock</time>, we put off in two boats, and landed in the face of four or five hundred
people, who were assembled on the shore. Though they were all armed with bows and arrows, clubs and
spears, they made not the least opposition. On the contrary, seeing me advance alone, with nothing
but a green branch in my hand, one of them, who seemed to be a chief, giving his bow and arrows to
another, met me in the water, bearing also a green branch, which having exchanged for the one I
held, he then took me by the hand, and led me up to the crowd. I immediately distributed presents to
them, and, in the mean time, the marines were drawn up upon the beach. I then made signs (for we
understood not a word of their language) that we wanted wood; and they made signs to us to cut down
the trees. By this time, a small pig being brought down and presented to me, I gave the bearer a
piece of cloth, with which he seemed well pleased. This made us hope that we should soon have some
more; but we were mistaken. The pig was not brought to be exchanged for what we had, but on some
other account, probably as a peace-offering. For, all we could say or do, did not prevail on them to
bring down, after this, above half a dozen cocoa-nuts, and a small quantity of fresh water. They set
no value on nails, or any sort of iron tools; nor indeed on any thing we had. They would, now and
then, exchange an arrow for a piece of cloth; but very seldom would part with a bow. They were
unwilling we should go off the beach, and very desirous we should return on board. At length, about
<time>noon</time>, after sending what wood we had cut on board, we embarked ourselves; and they all retired, some
one way and some another. Before we had dined, the <time>afternoon</time> was too far spent to do any thing on
shore; and all hands were employed, setting up the rigging, and repairing some defects in it. But
seeing a man bring along the strand a buoy, which they had taken in the night from the kedge-anchor,
I went on shore for it, accompanied by some of the gentlemen. The moment we landed, it was put into
the boat, by a man who walked off again without speaking one word. It ought to be observed, that
this was the only thing they took, or even attempted to take from us, by any means whatever. Being
landed near one of their plantations and houses, which were just within the skirts of the wood, I
prevailed on the man to conduct me to them; but, though they suffered Mr Forster to go with me, they
were unwilling any more should follow. These houses were something like those of the other isles;
rather low, and covered with palm thatch. Some were enclosed, or walled round with boards; and the
entrance to those was by a square hole at one end, which at this time was shut up, and they were
unwilling to open it for us to look in. There were here about six houses, and some small plantations
of roots, etc., fenced round with reeds as at the Friendly Isles. There were, likewise, some
bread-fruit, cocoa-nut, and plaintain trees; but very little fruit on any of them. A good many fine
yams were piled up upon sticks, or a kind of raised platform; and about twenty pigs, and a few
fowls, were running about loose. After making these observations, having embarked, we proceeded to
the S.E. point of the harbour, where we again landed and walked along the bench till we could see
the islands to the S.E. already mentioned. The names of these we now obtained, as well as the name
of that on which we were. This they called Mallicollo;* the island that first appeared over the
south end of Ambrym is called Apee; and the other with the hill upon it Paoom. We found on the beach
a fruit like an orange, called by them Abbimora; but whether it be fit for eating, I cannot say, as
this was decayed.</p><p>[* Or Mallicolla. Some of our people pronounced it Manicolo or Manicola, and thus it is also writ
in Quiros' Memorial, as printed by Dalrymple, vol. ii. p. 146.] </p><p>Proceeding next to the other side of the harbour, we there landed, near a few houses, at the
invitation of some people who came down to the shore; but we had not been there five minutes before
they wanted us to be gone. We complied, and proceeded up the harbour in order to sound it, and look
for fresh water, of which, as yet, we had seen none, but the very little that the natives brought,
which we knew not where they got. Nor was our search now attended with success; but this is no proof
that there is not any. The day was too far spent to examine the place well enough to determine this
point. Night having brought us on board, I was informed that no soul had been off to the ship; so
soon was the curiosity of these people satisfied. As we were coming on board, we heard the sound of
a drum, and, I think, of some other instruments, and saw people dancing; but us soon as they heard
the noise of the oars, or saw us, all was silent.</p><p>Being unwilling to lose the benefit of the moon-light nights, which now happened, at seven a.m.
on the 23d, we weighed; and, with a light air of wind, and the assistance of our boats, proceeded
out of the harbour, the south end of which, at <time>noon</time>, bore W.S.W., distant about two miles.</p><p>When the natives saw us under sail, they came off in canoes, making exchanges with more
confidence than before, and giving such extraordinary proofs of their honesty as surprised us. As
the ship, at first, had fresh way through the water, several of them dropped astern after they had
received our goods, and before they had time to deliver theirs in return. Instead of taking
advantage of this, as our friends at the Society Isles would have done, they used their utmost
efforts to get up with us, and to deliver what they had already been paid for. One man, in
particular, followed us a considerable time, and did not reach us till it was calm, and the thing
was forgotten. As soon as he came alongside he held up the thing which several were ready to buy;
but he refused to part with it, till he saw the person to whom he had before sold it, and to him he
gave it. The person, not knowing him again, offered him something in return, which he refused, and
shewed him what he had given him before. Pieces of cloth, and marble paper, were in most esteem with
them; but edge-tools, nails, and beads, they seemed to disregard. The greatest number of canoes we
had alongside at once did not exceed eight, and not more than four or five people in each, who would
frequently retire to the shore all on a sudden, before they had disposed of half their things, and
then others would come off.</p><p>At the time we came out of the harbour, it was about low water, and great numbers of people were
then on the shoals or reefs which lie along the shore, looking, as we supposed., for shell and other
fish. Thus our being on their coast, and in one of their ports, did not hinder them from following
the necessary employments. By this time they might be satisfied we meant them no harm; so that, had
we made a longer stay, we might soon have been upon good terms with this ape-like nation. For, in
general, they are the most ugly, ill-proportioned people I ever saw, and in every respect different
from any we had met with in this sea. They are a very dark-coloured and rather diminutive race; with
long heads, flat faces, and monkey countenances. Their hair mostly black or brown, is short and
curly; but not quite so soft and woolly as that of a negroe. Their beards are very strong, crisp,
and bushy, and generally black and short. But what most adds to their deformity, is a belt or cord
which they wear round the waist, and tie so tight over the belly, that the shape of their bodies is
not unlike that of an overgrown pismire. The men go quite naked, except a piece of cloth or leaf
used as a wrapper*.</p><p>[* The particular manner of applying the wrapper may be seen in Wafer's voyage, who mentions this
singular custom as existing, though with some little variation, amongst the Indians of the Isthmus
of Darien. See Wafer's Voyage, p. 140.]</p><p>We saw but few women, and they were not less ugly than the men; their heads, faces, and
shoulders, are painted red; they wear a kind of petticoat; and some of them had something over their
shoulders like a bag, in which they carry their children. None of them came off to the ship, and
they generally kept at a distance when we were on shore. Their ornaments are ear-rings, made of
tortoise-shell and bracelets. A curious one of the latter, four or five inches broad, wrought with
thread or cord, and studded with shells, is worn by them just above the elbow. Round the right wrist
they wear hogs' tusks, bent circular, and rings made of shells; and round their left, a round piece
of wood, which we judged was to ward off the bow-string. The bridge of the nose is pierced, in which
they wear a piece of white stone, about an inch and a half long. As signs of friendship they present
a green branch, and sprinkle water with the hand over the head.</p><p>Their weapons are clubs, spears, and bows and arrows. The two former are made of hard or
iron-wood. Their bows are about four feet long, made of a stick split down the middle, and are not
circular. The arrows, which are a sort of reeds, are sometimes armed with a long and sharp point,
made of the hard wood, and sometimes with a very hard point made of bone; and these points are all
covered with a substance which we took for poison. Indeed the people themselves confirmed our
suspicions, by making signs to us not to touch the point, and giving us to understand that if we
were prickled by them we should die. They are very careful of them themselves, and keep them, always
wrapped up in a quiver. Some of these arrows are formed with two or three points, each with small
prickles on the edges, to prevent the arrow being drawn out of the wound.</p><p>The people of Mallicollo seemed to be a quite different nation from any we had yet met with, and
speak a different language. Of about eighty words, which Mr Forster collected, hardly one bears any
affinity to the language spoken at any other island or place I had ever been at. The letter R is
used in many of their words; and frequently two or three being joined together, such words we found
difficult to pronounce. I observed that they could pronounce most of our words with great ease. They
express their admiration by hissing like a goose.</p><p>To judge of the country by the little water we saw of it, it must be fertile; but I believe their
fruits are not so good as those of the Society or Friendly Isles. Their cocoa-nut trees, I am
certain, are not; and their bread-fruit and plantains did not seem much better. But their yams
appeared to be very good. We saw no other animals than those I have already mentioned. They have not
so much as a name for a dog, and consequently have none, for which reason we left them a dog and a
bitch; and there is no doubt they will be taken care of, as they were very fond of them.</p><p>After we had got to sea, we tried what effect one of the poisoned arrows would have on a dog.
Indeed we had tried it in the harbour the very first night, but we thought the operation was too
slight, as it had no effect. The surgeon now made a deep incision in the dog's thigh, into which he
laid a large portion of the poison, just as it was scraped from the arrows, and then bound up the
wound with a bandage. For several days after we thought the dog was not so well as it had been
before, but whether this was really so, or only suggested by imagination, I know not. He was
afterwards as if nothing had been done to him, and lived to be brought home to England. However, I
have no doubt of this stuff being of a poisonous quality, as it could answer no other purpose. The
people seemed not unacquainted with the nature of poison, for when they brought us water on shore,
they first tasted it, and then gave us to understand we might with safety drink it.</p><p>This harbour, which is situated on the N.E. side of Mallicollo, not far from the S.E. end, in
latitude <geo select="lat">16° 25' 20" S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">167° 57' 23" E</geo>., I named Port Sandwich. It lies in S.W. by S.
about one league, and is one-third of a league broad. A reef of rocks extends out a little way from
each point, but the channel is of a good breadth, and hath in it from forty to twenty-four fathoms
water. In the port, the depth of water is from twenty to four fathoms; and it is so sheltered that
no winds can disturb a ship at anchor there. Another great advantage is, you can lie so near the
shore, as to cover your people, who may be at work upon it.</p></div><div type="chapter"><head><l>CHAPTER IV.</l><l><emph>An Account of the Discovery of several Islands, and an Interview and Skirmish with the

<time>three o'clock</time> in the <time>afternoon</time>, when the wind veering to the E.N.E. we tacked and stretched to the
S.E. and weathered the S.E. end of Mallicolo, off which we discovered three or four small islands,
that before appeared to be connected. At sun-set the point bore <!--EB-B Geocoding note to MATTIA AND ALL: I had several of the degree readings given here

from which the coast seemed to trend away west. At this time, the isle of Ambrym extended from N. 3°
E. to N. 65° E. The isle of Paoon from N. 76° E. to S. 88° E.; and the isle of Apee from S. 83° E.
to S. 43° E. We stood for this last isle, which we reached by midnight, and then brought-to till
day-break on the 24th, when we made sail to the S.E., with a view of plying up to the eastward on
the south side of Apee. At sun-rise we discovered several more islands, extending from the S.E.
point of Apee to the south as far as S.E. by S. The nearest to us we reached by <time>ten o'clock</time>, and not
being able to weather it, we tacked a mile from its shore in fourteen fathoms water. This island is
about four leagues in circuit, is remarkable by having three high peaked hills upon it, by which it
has obtained that name. In the p.m. the wind veering more to the north, we resumed our course to the
east; and having weathered Threehills, stood for the group of small isles which lie off the S.E.
point of Apee. These I called Shepherd's Isles, in honour of my worthy friend Dr Shepherd, Plumian
professor of astronomy at Cambridge. Having a fine breeze, I had thoughts of going through between
them; but the channels being narrow, and seeing broken water in the one we were steering for, I gave
up the design, and bore up, in order to go without, or to the south of them. Before this could be
accomplished, it fell calm, and we were left to the mercy of the current, close to the isles, where
we could find no soundings with a line of an hundred and eighty fathoms. We had now land or islands
in every direction, and were not able to count the number which lay round us. The mountain on Paoon
was seen over the east end of Apee, bearing N.N.W. at <time>eight o'clock</time>. A breeze at S.E. relieved us
from the anxiety the calm had occasioned; and we spent the night in making short boards.</p><p>The night before we came out of Port Sandwich, two reddish fish, about the size of large bream,
and not unlike them, were caught with hook and line. On these fish most of the officers, and some of
the petty officers, dined the next day. The night following, every one who had eaten of them was
seized with violent pains in the head and bones, attended with a scorching heat all over the skin,
and numbness in the joints. There remained no doubt that this was occasioned by the fish being of a
poisonous nature, and having communicated its bad effects to all who partook of them, even to the
hogs and dogs. One of the former died about sixteen hours after; it was not long before one of the
latter shared the same fate; and it was a week or ten days before all the gentlemen recovered. These
must have been the same sort of fish mentioned by Quiros,* under the name of pargos, which poisoned
the crews of his ships, so that it was some time before they recovered; and we should, doubtless,
have been in the same situation, had more of them been eaten.</p><p>[* Dalrymple's Collection of Voyages, vol. I. p. 140, 141.]</p><p>At day break on the 25th, we made a short stretch to the east of Shepherd's Isles till after
sun-rise, when seeing no more land in that direction, we tacked and stood for the island we had seen
in the south, having a gentle breeze at S.E. We passed to the east of Threehills, and likewise of a
low isle, which lies on the S.E. side of it, between a remarkable peaked rock which obtained the
name of Monument, and a small island named Twohills, on account of two peaked hills upon it,
disjoined by a low and narrow isthmus. The channel between this island and the Monument is near a
mile broad, and twenty-four fathoms deep. Except this rock, which is only accessible to birds, we
did not find an island on which people were not seen. At <time>noon</time>, we observed, in latitude <geo select="lat">17° 18' 30" S</geo>;
longitude, made from Port Sandwich, <geo select="lon">45' E</geo>.<!--EB-B GEOCODING NOTE: I don't think any of the following figures in this paragraph
are actually longitude readings, so I've removed their geo elements. We'll figure this out later. For some of these readings of relative position
in other paragraphs, I've just used a simple geo elements with no @select attached--> In this situation, the Monument bore N. 16° E. distant
two miles; Twohills bore N. 25° W. distant two miles, and in a line with the S.W. part of
Threehills; and the islands to the south extended from S. 16° 30' E. to S. 42° W.</p><p>Continuing our course to the south, at five p.m. we drew near the southern lands, which we found
to consist of one large island, whose southern and western extremities extended beyond our sight,
and three or four smaller ones lying off its north side. The two northernmost are much the largest,
have a good height, and lie in the direction of E. by S. and W. by N. from each other, distant two
leagues; I named the one Montagu and the other Hinchinbrook, and the large island Sandwich, in
honour of my noble patron the Earl of Sandwich. Seeing broken water ahead, between Montagu and
Hinchinbrook isles, we tacked; and soon after it fell calm. The calm continued till seven o'-clock
the next morning, when it was succeeded by a breeze from the westward. During the calm, having been
carried by the currents and a S.E. swell, four leagues to the W.N.W., we passed Hinchinbrook Isle,
saw the western extremity of Sandwich Island, bearing S.S.W., about five leagues distant, and at the
same time discovered a small island to the west of this direction. After getting the westerly
breeze, I steered S.E. in order to pass between Montagu Isle and the north end of Sandwich Island.
At <time>noon</time> we were in the middle of the channel, and observed in latitude <geo select="lat">17° 31' S</geo>. The distance from
one island to the other is about four or five miles; but the channel is not much above half that
breadth, being contracted by breakers. We had no soundings in it with a line of forty fathoms.</p><p>As we passed Montagu Isle several people came down to the sea-side, and, by signs, seemed to
invite us ashore. Some were also seen on Sandwich Island, which exhibited a most delightful
prospect, being spotted with woods and lawns, agreeably diversified over the whole surface. It hath
a gentle slope from the hills, which are of a moderate height, down to the sea coast. This is low,
and guarded by a chain of breakers, so that there is no approaching it at this part. But more to the
west, beyond Hinchinbrook Island, there seemed to run in a bay sheltered from the reigning winds.
The examining it not being so much an object, with me as the getting to the south, in order to find
the southern extremity of the Archipelago, with this view I steered S.S.E., being the direction of
the coast of Sandwich Island. We had but just got through the passage, before the west wind left us
to variable light airs and calms; so that we were apprehensive of being carried back again by the
currents, or rather of being obliged to return, in order to avoid being driven on the shoals, as
there was no anchorage, a line of an hundred and sixty fathoms not reaching to the bottom. At length
a breeze springing up at S.W. we stood to S.E., and at sun-set the Monument bore N. 14° 30' W., and
Montagu Island N. 28° W. distant three leagues. We judged we saw the S.E. extremity of Sandwich
Island, bearing about S. by E.</p><p>We continued to stand S.E. till four a.m. on the 27th, when we tacked to the west. At sun-rise,
having discovered a new land bearing south, and making in three hills, this occasioned us to tack
and stand towards it. At this time Montagu Isle bore N. 52° W., distant thirteen leagues; at <time>noon</time> it
was nearly in the same direction, and the new land extended from S. 1/2 E. to S. by W., and the
three hills seemed to be connected. Our latitude by observation, was <geo select="lat">18° 1' S</geo>., and the longitude,
made from Port Sandwich, <geo select="lon">1° 23' E</geo>. We continued to stand to the S.E., with a gentle breeze at S.W.
and S.S.W. till the 28th at sun-rise, when, the wind veering to the south, we tacked and stood to
the west. The three hills mentioned above, we now saw, belonging to one island, which extended from
S. 35° to <geo select="lon">71° W</geo>. distant about ten or twelve leagues.</p><p><date>1774 August</date></p><p>Retarded by contrary winds, calms, and the currents, that set to N.W., we were three days in
gaining this space; in which time we discovered an elevated land to the south of this; It first
appeared in detached hummocks, but we judged it to be connected. At length, on the 1st of August,
about ten a.m. we got a fine breeze at E.S.E., which soon after veered to N.E., and we steered for
the N.W. side of the island. Reaching it about two p.m., we ranged the west coast at one mile from
shore, on which the inhabitants appeared in several parts, and by signs invited us to land. We
continued to sound without finding bottom, till we came before a small bay, or bending of the coast,
where, near a mile from shore, we found thirty and twenty-two fathoms water, a sandy bottom. I had
thoughts of anchoring here, but the wind almost instantly veered to N.W.; which being nearly on
shore, I laid this design aside. Besides, I was unwilling to lose the opportunity that now offered
of getting to the south-east, in order first to explore the lands which lay there. I therefore
continued to range the coast to the south, at about the same distance from shore; but we soon got
out of soundings. About a league to the south of this bay, which hath about two miles extent, is
another more extensive. Towards the evening, the breeze began to abate, so that it was sun-set
before we got the length of it. I intended not to stop here, and to stand to the south under an easy
sail all night; but at <time>eight o'clock</time>, as we were steering S.S.E. we saw a light ahead. Not knowing
but it might be on some low detached isle, dangerous to approach while dark, we hauled the wind, and
spent the night standing off and on, or rather driving to and fro; for we had but very little
wind.</p><p>At sun-rise on the 2d, we saw no more land than the coast we were upon; but found that the
currents had carried us some miles to the north, and we attempted, to little purpose, to regain what
we had lost. At <time>noon</time> we were about a league from the coast, which extended from S.S.E. to N.E.
Latitude observed <geo select="lat">18° 45' S</geo>. In the <time>afternoon</time>, finding the ship to drift not only to the north, but
in shore also, and being yet to the south of the bay we passed the day before, I had thoughts of
getting to an anchor before night, while we had it in our power to make choice of a place. With this
view, having hoisted out two boats, one of them was sent ahead to tow the ship; in the other Mr
Gilbert went to sound for anchorage. Soon after, the towing boat was sent to assist him. So much
time was spent in sounding this bay, that the ship drove past, which made it necessary to call the
boats on board to tow her off from the northern point. But this service was performed by a breeze of
wind, which, that moment, sprung up at S.W.; so that as the boats got on board, we hoisted them in,
and then bore up for the north side of the island, intending once more to try to get round by the
east; Mr Gilbert informed me, that at the south part of the bay, he found no soundings till close to
a steep stone beach, where he landed to taste a stream of water he saw there, which proved to be
salt. Some people were seen there, but they kept at a distance. Farther down the coast, that is to
the north, he found twenty, twenty-four, and thirty fathoms, three-fourths of a mile, or a mile,
from shore, the bottom a fine dark sand.</p><p>On the 3d, at sun-rise, we found ourselves abreast a lofty promontory on the S.E. side of the
island, and about three leagues from it. Having but little wind, and that from the south, right in
our teeth, and being in want of fire-wood, I sent Lieutenant Clerke with two boats to a small islet
which lies off the promontory, to endeavour to get some. In the mean time we continued to ply up
with the ship; but what we gained by our sails, we lost by the current. At length towards <time>noon</time>, we
got a breeze at E.S.E., and E., with which we could lie up for the head; and soon after Mr Clerke
returned, having not been able to land, on account of a high surf on the shore. They met with no
people on the isle; but saw a large bat, and some birds, and caught a water-snake. At <time>six o'clock</time>
p.m. we got in with the land, under the N.W. side of the head, where we anchored in seventeen
fathoms water, the bottom a fine dark sand, half a mile from shore; the point of the head bearing N.
18° E., distant half a league; the little islet before-mentioned N.E. by E. 1/2 E., and the N.W.
point of the bay N. 32° W. Many people appeared on the shore, and some attempted to swim off to us;
but having occasion to send the boat ahead to sound, they retired as she drew near them. This,
however, gave us a favourable idea of them.</p><p>On the 4th, at day-break, I went with two boats to examine the coast, to look for a proper
landing-place, wood, and water. At this time, the natives began to assemble on the shore, and by
signs invited us to land. I went first to a small beach, which is towards the head, where I found no
good landing, on account of some rocks which every where lined the coast. I, however, put the boat's
bow to the shore, and gave cloth, medals, etc. to some people who were there. For this treatment
they offered to haul the boats over the breakers to the sandy beach, which I thought a friendly
offer, but had reason afterwards to alter my opinion. When they found I would not do as they
desired, they made signs for us to go down into the bay, which we accordingly did, and they ran
along shore abreast of us, their number increasing prodigiously. I put in to the shore in two or
three places, but, not liking the situation, did not land. By this time, I believe, the natives
conceived what I wanted, as they directed me round a rocky point, where, on a fine sandy beach, I
stepped out of the boat without wetting a foot, in the face of a vast multitude, with only a green
branch in my hand, which I had before got from one of them. I took but one man out of the boat with
me, and ordered the other boat to lie-to at a little distance off. They received me with great
courtesy and politeness; and would retire back from the boat on my making the least motion with my
hand. A man, whom I took to be a chief, seeing this, made them form a semicircle round the boat's
bow, and beat such as attempted to break through this order. This man I loaded with presents, giving
likewise to others, and asked by signs for fresh water, in hopes of seeing where they got it. The
chief immediately sent a man for some, who ran to a house, and presently returned with a little in a
bamboo; so that I gained but little information by this. I next asked, by the same means, for
something to eat, and they as readily brought me a yam, and some cocoa-nuts. In short, I was charmed
with their behaviour; and the only thing which could give the least suspicion was, that most of them
were armed with clubs, spears, darts, and bows and arrows. For this reason I kept my eye continually
upon the chief, and watched his looks as well as his actions. He made many signs to me to haul the
boat up upon the shore, and at last slipped into the crowd, where I observed him speak to several
people, and then return to me, repeating signs to haul the boat up, and hesitating a good deal
before he would receive some spike-nails, which I then offered him. This made me suspect something
was intended, and immediately I stepped into the boat, telling them by signs that I should soon
return. But they were not for parting so soon, and now attempted by force, what they could not
obtain by gentler means. The gang-board happened unluckily to be laid out for me to come into the
boat, I say unluckily, for if it had not been out, and if the crew had been a little quicker in
getting the boat off, the natives might not have had time to put their design in execution, nor
would the following disagreeable scene have happened. As we were putting off the boat, they laid
hold of the gang-board, and unhooked it off the boat's stern. But as they did not take it away, I
thought this had been done by accident, and ordered the boat in again to take it up. Then they
themselves hooked it over the boat's stern, and attempted to haul her ashore; others, at the same
time, snatched the oars out of the people's hands. On my pointing a musket at them, they in some
measure desisted, but returned in an instant, seemingly determined to haul the boat ashore. At the
head of this party was the chief; the others, who could not come at the boat, stood behind with
darts, stones, and bows and arrows in hand, ready to support them. Signs and threats having no
effect, our own safety became the only consideration; and yet I was unwilling to fire on the
multitude, and resolved to make the chief alone fall a victim to his own treachery; but my musket at
this critical moment missed fire. Whatever idea they might have formed of the arms we held in our
hands, they must now have looked upon them as childish weapons, and began to let us see how much
better theirs were, by throwing stones and darts, and by shooting arrows. This made it absolutely
necessary for me to give orders to fire. The first discharge threw them into confusion; but a second
was hardly sufficient to drive them off the beach; and after all, they continued to throw stones
from behind the trees and bushes, and, every now and then, to pop out and throw a dart. Four lay, to
all appearance, dead on the shore; but two of them afterwards crawled into the bushes. Happy it was
for these people, that not half our muskets would go off, otherwise many more must have fallen. We
had one man wounded in the cheek with a dart, the point of which was as thick as my finger, and yet
it entered above two inches, which shews that it must have come with great force, though indeed we
were very near them. An arrow struck Mr Gilbert's naked breast, who was about thirty yards off; but
probably it had struck something before; for it hardly penetrated the skin. The arrows were pointed
with hard wood.</p><p>As soon as we got on board, I ordered the anchor to be weighed, with a view of anchoring near the
landing-place. While this was doing, several people appeared on the low rock point, displaying two
oars we had lost in the scuffle. I looked on this as a sign of submission, and of their wanting to
give us the oars. I was, nevertheless, prevailed on to fire a four-pound shot at them, to let them
see the effect of our great guns. The ball fell short, but frightened them so much, that none were
seen afterwards; and they left the oars standing up against the bushes.</p><p>It was now calm; but the anchor was hardly at the bow before a breeze sprung up at north, of
which we took the advantage, set our sails, and plyed out of the bay, as it did not seem capable of
supplying our wants with that conveniency I wished to have. Besides, I always had it in my power to
return to this place, in case I should find none more convenient farther south.</p><p>These islanders seemed to be a different race from those of Mallicollo; and spoke a different
language. They are of the middle size, have a good shape, and tolerable features. Their colour is
very dark, and they paint their faces, some with black, and others with red pigment. Their hair is
very curly and crisp, and somewhat woolly. I saw a few women, and I thought them ugly; they wore a
kind of petticoat made of palm-leaves, or some plant like it. But the men, like those of Mallicollo,
were in a manner naked; having only the belt about the waist, and the piece of cloth, or leaf, used
as a wrapper*. I saw no canoes with these people, nor were any seen in any part of this island. They
live in houses covered with thatch, and their plantations are laid out by a line, and fenced
round.</p><p>[* The particular manner of applying the wrapper may be seen in Wafer's voyage, who mentions this
singular custom as existing, though with some little variation, amongst the Indians of the Isthmus
of Darien. See Wafer's Voyage, p. 140.]</p><p>At <time>two o'clock</time> in the <time>afternoon</time>, we were clear of the bay, bore up round the head, and steered
S.S.E. for the south end of the island, having a fine breeze at N.W. On the S.W. side of the head is
a pretty deep bay, which seemed to run in behind the one on the N.W. side. Its shores are low, and
the adjacent lands appeared very fertile. It is exposed to the S.E. winds; for which reason, until
it be better known, the N.W. bay is preferable, because it is sheltered from the reigning winds; and
the winds to which it is open, viz. from N.W. by N. to E. by N., seldom blow strong. The promontory,
or peninsula, which disjoins these two bays, I named Traitor's Head, from the treacherous behaviour
of its inhabitants. It is the N.E. point of the island, situated in the latitude <geo select="lat">18° 43' S</geo>.
longitude <geo select="lon">169° '28' E</geo>., and terminates in a saddle-hill which is of height sufficient to be seen
sixteen or eighteen leagues. As we advanced to S.S.E., the new island, we had before discovered,
began to appear over the S.E. point of the one near us, bearing S. 1/2 E., distant ten or twelve
leagues. After leaving this one, we steered for the east end of the other, being directed by a great
light we saw upon it.</p><p>At <time>one o'clock</time> the next morning, drawing near the shore, we tacked and spent the remainder of the
night making short boards. At sun-rise we discovered a high table land (an island) bearing E. by S.,
and a small low isle in the direction of N.N.E., which we had passed in the night without seeing it.
Traitor's Head was still in sight, bearing N. 20° W. distant fifteen leagues, and the island to the
south extended from S. 7° W. to S. 87° W. distant three or four miles. We then found that the light
we had seen in the night was occasioned by a volcano, which we observed to throw up vast quantities
of fire and smoke, with a rumbling noise heard at a great distance. We now made sail for the island;
and, presently after, discovered a small inlet which had the appearance of being a good harbour. In
order to be better informed, I sent away two armed boats, under the command of Lieutenant Cooper, to
sound it; and, in the meanwhile, we stood on and off with the ship, to be ready to follow, or give
them any assistance they might want. On the east point of the entrance, we observed a number of
people, and several houses and canoes; and when our boats entered the harbour, they launched some,
and followed them, but came not near. It was not long before Mr Cooper made the signal for
anchorage; and we stood in with the ship. The wind being at west, and our course S.S.W., we borrowed
close to the west point, and passed over some sunken rocks, which might have been avoided, by
keeping a little more to the east, or about one-third channel over. The wind left us as soon as we
were within the entrance, and obliged us to drop an anchor in four fathoms water. After this, the
boats were sent again to sound; and, in the meantime, the launch was hoisted out, in order to carry
out anchors to warp in by, as soon as we should be acquainted with the channel.</p><p>While we were thus employed, many of the natives got together in parties, on several parts of the
shore, all armed with bows, spears, etc. Some swam off to us, others came in canoes. At first they
were shy, and kept at the distance of a stone's throw; they grew insensibly bolder; and, at last,
came under our stern, and made some exchanges. The people in one of the first canoes, after coming
as near as they durst, threw towards us some cocoa-nuts. I went into a boat and picked them up,
giving them in return some cloth and other articles. This induced others to come under the stern,
and alongside, where their behaviour was insolent and daring. They wanted to carry off every thing
within their reach; they got hold of the fly of the ensign, and would have torn it from the staff;
others attempted to knock the rings off the rudder; but the greatest trouble they gave us was to
look after the buoys of our anchors, which were no sooner thrown out of our boats, or let go from
the ship, than they got hold of them. A few muskets fired in the air had no effect; but a
four-pounder frightened them so much, that they quitted their canoes that instant, and took to the
water. But as soon as they found themselves unhurt, they got again into their canoes, gave us some
halloos, flourished their weapons, and returned once more to the buoys. This put us to the expence
of a few musquetoon shot, which had the desired effect. Although none were hurt, they were
afterwards afraid to come near the buoys; very soon all retired on shore, and we were permitted to
sit down to dinner undisturbed.</p><p>During these transactions, a friendly old man in a small canoe made several trips between us and
the shore, bringing off each time a few cocoa-nuts, or a yam, and taking in exchange whatever we
gave him. Another was on the gangway when the great gun was fired, but I could not prevail on him to
stay there long. Towards the evening, after the ship was moored, I landed at the head of the
harbour, in the S.E. corner, with a strong party of men, without any opposition being made by a
great number of the natives who were assembled in two parties, the one on our right and the other on
the left, armed with clubs, darts, spears, slings, and stones, bows, and arrows, etc. After
distributing to the old people (for we could distinguish no chief), and some others, presents of
cloth, medals, etc. I ordered two casks to be filled with water out of a pond about twenty paces
behind the landing-place; giving the natives to understand, that this was one of the articles we
wanted. Besides water, we got from them a few cocoa-nuts, which seemed to be in plenty on the trees;
but they could not be prevailed upon to part with any of their weapons. These they held in constant
readiness, and in the proper attitudes of offence and defence; so that little was wanting to make
them attack us; at least we thought so, by their pressing so much upon us, and in spite of our
endeavours to keep them off. Our early re-embarking probably disconcerted their scheme; and after
that, they all retired. The friendly old man before mentioned, was in one of these parties; and we
judged, from his conduct, that his temper was pacific.</p></div><div type="chapter"><head><l>CHAPTER V.</l><l><emph>An Intercourse established with the Natives; some Account of the Island, and a Variety of
Incidents that happened during our Stay at it.</emph></l></head><p><date>August 1774</date></p><p>As we wanted to take in a large quantity both of wood and water, and as, when I was on shore, I
had found it practicable to lay the ship much nearer the landing-place than she now was, which would
greatly facilitate that work, as well as overawe the natives, and enable us better to cover and
protect the working party on shore; with this view, on the 6th, we went to work to transport the
ship to the place I designed to moor her in. While we were about this, we observed the natives
assembling from all parts, and forming themselves into two parties, as they did the preceding
evening, one on each side the landing-place, to the amount of some thousands, armed as before. A
canoe, sometimes conducted by one, and at other times by two or three men, now and then came off,
bringing a few cocoa-nuts or plantains. These they gave us without asking for any return; but I took
care they should always have something. Their chief design seemed to invite us on shore. One of
those who came off was the old man, who had already ingratiated himself into our favour. I made him
understand, by signs, that they were to lay aside their weapons, took those which were in the canoe,
and threw them overboard, and made him a present of a large piece of cloth. There was no doubt but
he understood me, and made my request known to his countrymen. For as soon as he landed, we observed
him to go first to the one party, and then to the other; nor was he, ever after, seen by us with any
thing like a weapon in his hand. After this, three fellows came in a canoe under the stern, one of
them brandishing a club, with which he struck the ship's side, and committed other acts of defiance,
but at last offered to exchange it for a string of beads, and some other trifles. These were sent
down to him by a line; but the moment they were in his possession, he and his companions paddled off
in all haste, without giving the club or any thing else in return. This was what I expected, and
indeed what I was not sorry for, as I wanted an opportunity to shew the multitude on shore, the
effect of our fire arms, without materially hurting any of them. Having a fowling-piece loaded with
small shot (No. 3) I gave the fellow the contents; and, when they were above musquet-shot off, I
ordered some of the musquetoons, or wall-pieces, to be fired, which made them leap out of the canoe,
keep under her offside, and swim with her ashore. This transaction seemed to make little or no
impression on the people there. On the contrary, they began to halloo, and to make sport of it.</p><p>After mooring the ship, by four anchors, with her broadside to the landing-place, hardly
musquet-shot off, and placing our artillery in such a manner as to command the whole harbour, I
embarked with the marines, and a party of seamen, in three boats, and rowed in for the shore. It
hath been already mentioned, that the two divisions of the natives were drawn up on each side the
landing-place. They had left a space between them of about thirty or forty yards, in which were
laid, to the most advantage, a few small bunches of plantains, a yam, and two or three roots.
Between these and the water were stuck upright in the sand, for what purpose I never could learn,
four small reeds, about two feet from each other, in a line at right angles to the shore, where they
remained for two or three days after. The old man before-mentioned, and two more, stood by these
things, inviting us, by signs, to land; but I had not forgot the trap I was so near being caught in
at the last island; and this looked something like it. We answered, by making signs for the two
divisions to retire farther back, and give us more room. The old man seemed to desire them so to do,
but no more regard was paid to him than to us. More were continually joining them, and, except two
or three old men, not one unarmed. In short, every thing conspired to make us believe they meant to
attack us as soon as we should be on shore; the consequence of which was easily supposed; many of
them must have been killed and wounded, and we should hardly have escaped unhurt; two things I
equally wished to prevent. Since, therefore, they would not give us the room required, I thought it
was better to frighten them into it, than to oblige them by the deadly effect of our fire-arms. I
accordingly ordered a musquet to be fired over the party on our right, which was by far the
strongest body; but the alarm it gave them was momentary. In an instant they recovered themselves
and began to display their weapons. One fellow shewed us his backside, in a manner which plainly
conveyed his meaning.</p><p>After this I ordered three or four more musquets to be fired. This was the signal for the ship to
fire a few great guns, which presently dispersed them; and then we landed, and marked out the
limits, on the right and left, by a line. Our old friend stood his ground, though deserted by his
two companions, and I rewarded his confidence with a present. The natives came gradually to us,
seemingly in a more friendly manner; some even without their weapons, but by far the greatest part
brought them; and when we made signs to lay them down, they gave us to understand that we must lay
down ours first. Thus all parties stood armed. The presents I made to the old people, and to such as
seemed to be of consequence, had little effect on their conduct. They indeed climbed the cocoa-nut
trees, and threw us down the nuts, without requiring any thing for them; but I took care that they
should always have somewhat in return. I observed that many were afraid to touch what belonged to
us; and they seemed to have no notion of exchanging one thing for another. I took the old man (whose
name we now found to be Paowang) to the woods, and made him understand, I wanted to cut down some
trees to take on board the ship; cutting some down at the same time, which we put into one of our
boats, together with a few small casks of water, with a view of letting the people see what it was
we chiefly wanted. Paowang very readily gave his consent to cut wood; nor was there any one who made
the least objection. He only desired the cocoa-nut trees might not be cut down. Matters being thus
settled, we embarked and returned on board to dinner, and, immediately after, they all dispersed. I
never learnt that any one was hurt by our shot, either on this or the preceding day; which was a
very happy circumstance. In the <time>afternoon</time> having landed again, we loaded the launch with water, and
having made three hauls with the seine, caught upwards of three hundred pounds of mullet and other
fish. It was some time before any of the natives appeared, and not above twenty or thirty at last,
amongst whom was our trusty friend Paowang, who made us a present of a small pig, which was the only
one we got at this isle, or that was offered to us.</p><p>During the night the volcano, which was about four miles to the west of us, vomited up vast
quantities of fire and smoke, as it had also done the night before; and the flames were seen to rise
above the hill which lay between us and it. At every eruption it made a long rumbling noise like
that of thunder, or the blowing up of large mines. A heavy shower of rain, which fell at this time,
seemed to increase it; and the wind blowing from the same quarter, the air was loaded with its
ashes, which fell so thick that every thing was covered with the dust. It was a kind of fine sand,
or stone, ground or burnt to powder, and was exceedingly troublesome to the eyes.</p><p>Early in the morning of the 7th, the natives began again to assemble near the watering-place,
armed as usual, but not in such numbers as at first. After breakfast, we landed, in order to cut
wood and fill water. I found many of the islanders much inclined to be friends with us, especially
the old people; on the other hand, most of the younger were daring and insolent, and obliged us to
keep to our arms. I staid till I saw no disturbance was like to happen, and then returned to the
ship, leaving the party under the command of Lieutenants Clerke and Edgcumbe. When they came on
board to dinner, they informed me that the people continued to behave in the same inconsistent
manner as in the morning; but more especially one man, whom Mr Edgcumbe was obliged to fire at, and
believed he had struck with a swan shot. After that the others behaved with more discretion; and as
soon as our people embarked they all retired. While we were sitting at dinner an old man came on
board, looked into many parts of the ship, and then went ashore again.</p><p>In the <time>afternoon</time>, only a few of those who lived in the neighbourhood, with whom we were now upon
a tolerable footing, made their appearance at the watering-place. Paowang brought us an axe which
had been left by our people, either in the woods or on the beach, and found by some of the natives.
A few other articles were afterwards returned to us, which either they had stolen, or we had lost by
our negligence, so careful were they now not to offend us in this respect.</p><p>Early the next morning, I sent the launch, protected by a party of marines in another boat, to
take in ballast, which was wanted. This work was done before breakfast; and after it, she was sent
for wood and water, and with her the people employed in this service, under the protection of a
serjeant's guard, which was now thought sufficient, as the natives seemed to be pretty well
reconciled to us. I was told, that they asked our people to go home with them, on condition they
stripped naked as they were. This shews that they had no design to rob them, whatever other they
might have.</p><p>On the 9th, I sent the launch for more ballast, and the guard and wooders to the usual place.
With these I went myself, and found a good many of the natives collected together, whose behaviour,
though armed, was courteous and obliging; so that there was no longer any occasion to mark out the
limits by a line; they observed them without this precaution. As it was necessary for Mr Wales's
instruments to remain on shore all the middle of the day, the guard did not return to dinner, as
they had done before, till relieved by others. When I came off, I prevailed on a young man, whose
name was Wha-a-gou, to accompany me. Before dinner I shewed him every part of the ship; but did not
observe that any thing fixed his attention a moment, or caused in him the least surprise. He had no
knowledge of goats, dogs, or cats, calling them all hogs (<emph>Booga</emph> or
<emph>Boogas</emph>). I made him a present of a dog and a bitch, as he shewed a liking to that kind
of animal. Soon after he came on board, some of his friends followed in a canoe, and enquired for
him, probably doubtful of his safety. He looked out of the quarter gallery, and having spoken to
them, they went ashore, and quickly returned with a cock, a little sugar-cane, and a few cocoa-nuts,
as a present to me. Though he sat down with us, he did but just taste our salt pork, but eat pretty
heartily of yam, and drank a glass of wine. After dinner I made him presents, and then conducted
him, ashore.</p><p>As soon as we landed, the youth and some of his friends took me by the hand, with a view, as I
understood, to conduct me to their habitations. We had not gone far, before some of them, for what
reason I know not, were unwilling I should proceed; in consequence of which the whole company
stopped; and, if I was not mistaken, a person was dispatched for something or other to give me; for
I was desired to sit down and wait, which I accordingly did. During this interval, several of our
gentlemen passed us, at which they shewed great uneasiness, and importuned me so much to order them
back, that I was at last obliged to comply. They were jealous of our going up the country, or even
along the shore of the harbour. While I was waiting here, our friend Paowang came with a present of
fruit and roots, carried by about twenty men; in order, as I supposed, to make it appear the
greater. One had a small bunch of plantains, another a yam, a third a cocoa-nut, etc.; but two men
might have carried the whole with ease. This present was in return for something I had given him in
the morning; however, I thought the least I could do now, was to pay the porters.</p><p>After I had dispatched Paowang, I returned to Wha-a-gou and his friends, who were still for
detaining me. They seemed to wait with great impatience for something, and to be unwilling and
ashamed to take away the two dogs, without making me a return. As night was approaching, I pressed
to be gone; with which they complied, and so we parted.</p><p>The preceding day, Mr Forster learnt from the people the proper name of the island, which they
call Tanna; and this day I learnt from them the names of those in the neighbourhood. The one we
touched at last is called Erromango; the small isle, which we discovered the morning we landed here,
Immer; the Table island to the east, discovered at the same time, Erronan or Footoona; and an island
which lies to the S.E. Annattom. All these islands are to be seen from Tanna.</p><p>They gave us to understand, in a manner which I thought admitted of no doubt, that they eat human
flesh, and that circumcision was practised among them. They began the subject of eating human flesh,
of their own accord, by asking us if we did; otherwise I should never have thought of asking them
such a question. I have heard people argue, that no nation could be cannibals, if they had other
flesh to eat, or did not want food; thus deriving the custom from necessity. The people of this
island can be under no such necessity; they have fine pork and fowls, and plenty of roots and
fruits. But since we have not actually seen them eat human flesh, it will admit of doubt with some,
whether they are cannibals.</p><p>When I got on board, I learnt that, when the launch was on the west side of the harbour taking in
ballast, one of the men employed in this work, had scalded his fingers in taking a stone up out of
some water. This circumstance produced the discovery of several hot springs, at the foot of the
cliff, and rather below high-water mark.</p><p>This day Mr Wales, and two or three of the officers advanced a little, for the first time, into
the island. They met with a small straggling village, the inhabitants of which treated them with
great civility; and the next morning Mr Forster and his party made another excursion inland. They
met with several fine plantations of plantains, sugar-canes, yams, etc.; and the natives were
courteous and civil. Indeed, by this time, the people, especially those in our neighbourhood, were
so well reconciled to us, that they shewed not the least dislike at our rambling about in the skirts
of the woods, shooting, etc. In the <time>afternoon</time> some boys having got behind thickets, and having
thrown two or three stones at our people who were cutting wood, they were fired at by the petty
officers present on duty. Being ashore at that time, I was alarmed at hearing the report of the
musquets, and seeing two or three boys run out of the wood. When I knew the cause I was much
displeased at so wanton an use being made of our fire-arms, and took measures to prevent it for the
future. Wind southerly, with heavy showers of rain.</p><p>During the night, and also all the 11th, the volcano was exceedingly troublesome, and made a
terrible noise, throwing up prodigious columns of fire and smoke at each explosion, which happened
every three or four minutes; and, at one time, great stones were seen high in the air. Besides the
necessary work of wooding and watering, we struck the main-top-mast to fix new trestle-trees and
back-stays. Mr Forster and his party went up the hill on the west side of the harbour, where he
found three places from whence smoke of a sulphureous smell issued, through cracks and fissures in
the earth. The ground about these was exceedingly hot, and parched or burnt, and they seemed to keep
pace with the volcano; for, at every explosion of the latter, the quantity of smoke or steam in
these was greatly increased, and forced out so as to rise in small columns, which we saw from the
ship, and had taken for common fires made by the natives. At the foot of this hill are the
hot-springs before mentioned.</p><p>In the <time>afternoon</time>, Mr Forster having begun his botanical researches on the other side of the
harbour, fell in with our friend Paowang's house, where he saw most of the articles I had given him,
hanging on the adjoining trees and bushes, as if they were not worthy of being under his roof.</p><p>On the 12th, some of the officers accompanied Mr Forster to the hot places he had been at the
preceding day. A thermometer placed in a little hole made in one of them, rose from 80, at which it
stood in the open air, to 170. Several other parts of the hill emitted smoke or steam all the day,
and the volcano was unusually furious, insomuch that the air was loaded with its ashes. The rain
which fell at this time was a compound of water, sand, and earth; so that it properly might be
called showers of mire. Whichever way the wind was, we were plagued with the ashes; unless it blew
very strong indeed from the opposite direction. Notwithstanding the natives seemed well enough
satisfied with the few expeditions we had made in the neighbourhood, they were unwilling we should
extend them farther. As a proof of this, some undertook to guide the gentlemen when they were in the
country, to a place where they might see the mouth of the volcano. They very readily embraced the
offer; and were conducted down to the harbour, before they perceived the cheat.</p><p>The 13th, wind at N.E., gloomy weather. The only thing worthy of note this day was, that Paowang
being at dinner with us on board, I took the opportunity to shew him several parts of the ship, and
various articles, in hopes of finding out something which they might value, and be induced to take
from us in exchange for refreshments; for what we got of this kind was trifling. But he looked on
every thing that was shewn him with the utmost indifference; nor did he take notice of any one
thing, except a wooden sand-box, which he seemed to admire, and turned it two or three times over in
his hand.</p><p>Next morning after breakfast, a party of us set out for the country, to try if we could not get a
nearer and better view of the volcano. We went by the way of one of those hot smoking places before
mentioned, and dug a hole in the hottest part, into which a thermometer of Fahrenheit's construction
was put; and the mercury presently rose to 100°. It remained in the hole two minutes and a half
without either rising or falling. The earth about this place was a kind of white clay, had a
sulphureous smell, and was soft and wet, the surface only excepted, over which was spread a thin dry
crust, that had upon it some sulphur, and a vitriolic substance, tasting like alum. The place
affected by the heat was not above eight or ten yards square; and near it were some fig-trees, which
spread their branches over part of it, and seemed to like their situation. We thought that this
extraordinary heat was caused by the steam of boiling water, strongly impregnated with sulphur. I
was told that some of the other places were larger than this; though we did not go out of the road
to look at them, but proceeded up the hill through a country so covered with trees, shrubs, and
plants, that the bread-fruit and cocoa-nut trees, which, seem to have been planted here by nature,
were, in a manner, choaked up. Here and there we met with a house, some few people, and plantations.
These latter we found in different states, some of long standing, others lately cleared, and some
only clearing, and before any thing had been planted. The clearing of a piece of ground for
plantation, seemed to be a work of much labour, considering the tools they had to work with, which,
though much inferior to those at the Society Isles, are of the same kind. Their method is, however,
judicious, and as expeditious as it can well be. They lop off the small branches of the large trees,
dig under the roots, and there burn the branches and small shrubs and plants which they root up. The
soil, in some parts, is a rich black mould; in other parts, it seemed to be composed of decayed
vegetables, and of the ashes the volcano sends forth throughout all its neighbourhood. Happening to
turn out of the common path, we came into a plantation where we found a man at work, who, either out
of good-nature, or to get us the sooner out of his territories, undertook to be our guide. We
followed him, accordingly, but had not gone far before we came to the junction of two roads, in one
of which stood another man with a sling and a stone, which he thought proper to lay down when a
musquet was pointed at him. The attitude in which we found him, the ferocity appearing in his looks,
and his behaviour after, convinced us that he meant to defend the path he stood in. He, in some
measure, gained his point, for our guide took the other road, and we followed, but not without
suspecting he was leading us out of the common way. The other man went with us likewise, counting us
several times over, and hallooing, as we judged, for assistance; for we were presently joined by two
or three more, among whom was a young woman with a club in her hand. By these people we were
conducted to the brow of a hill, and shewn a road leading down to the harbour, which they wanted us
to take. Not choosing to comply, we returned to that we had left, which we pursued alone, our guide
refusing to go with us. After ascending another ridge, as thickly covered with wood as those we had
come over, we saw yet other hills between us and the volcano, which seemed as far off as at our
first setting out. This discouraged us from proceeding farther, especially as we could get no one to
be our guide. We therefore came to a resolution to return; and had but just put this in execution
when we met between twenty and thirty people, whom the fellow before mentioned had collected
together, with a design, as we judged, to oppose our advancing into the country; but as they saw us
returning they suffered us to pass unmolested. Some of them put us into the right road, accompanied
us down the hill, made us stop by the way, to entertain us with cocoa-nuts, plantains, and
sugar-cane; and what we did not eat on the spot, they brought down the hill with us. Thus we found
these people hospitable, civil, and good-natured, when not prompted to a contrary conduct by
jealousy; a conduct I cannot tell how to blame them for, especially when I considered the light in
which they must view us. It was impossible for them to know our real design; we enter their ports
without their daring to oppose; we endeavour to land in their country as friends, and it is well if
this succeeds; we land, nevertheless, and maintain the footing we have got, by the superiority of
our fire-arms. Under such circumstances, what opinion are they to form of us? Is it not as
reasonable for them to think that we are come to invade their country, as to pay them a friendly
visit? Time, and some acquaintance with us, can only convince them of the latter. These people are
yet in a rude state; and, if we may judge from circumstances and appearances, are frequently at war,
not only with their neighbours, but among themselves; consequently must be jealous of every new
face. I will allow there are some exceptions to this rule to be found in this sea; but there are few
nations who would willingly suffer visitors like us to advance far into their country.</p><p>Before this excursion, some of us had been of opinion that these people were addicted to an
unnatural passion, because they had endeavoured to entice some of our men into the woods; and, in
particular, I was told, that one who had the care of Mr Forster's plant bag, had been once or twice
attempted. As the carrying of bundles, etc. is the office of the women in this country, it had
occurred to me, and I was not singular in this, that the natives might mistake him and some others
for women. My conjecture was fully verified this day. For this man, who was one of the party, and
carried the bag as usual, following me down the hill, by the words which I understood of the
conversation of the natives, and by their actions, I was well assured that they considered him as a
female; till, by some means, they discovered their mistake, on which they cried out, "Erramange!
Erramange!" "It is a man! It is a man!" The thing was so palpable, that every one was obliged to
acknowledge, that they had before mistaken his sex: and that, after they were undeceived, they
seemed not to have the least notion of what we had suspected. This circumstance will shew how liable
we are to form wrong conjectures of things, among people whose language we are ignorant of. Had it
not been for this discovery, I make no doubt that these people would have been charged with this
vile custom.</p><p>In the evening I took a walk with some of the gentlemen into the country on the other side of the
harbour, where we had very different treatment from what we had met with in the morning. The people
we now visited, among whom was our friend Paowang, being better acquainted with us, shewed a
readiness to oblige us in every thing in their power. We came to the village which had been visited
on the 9th. It consisted of about twenty houses, the most of which need no other description than
comparing them to the roof of a thatched house in England, taken off the walls and placed on the
ground. Some were open at both ends, others partly closed with reeds, and all were covered with palm
thatch. A few of them were thirty or forty feet long, and fourteen or sixteen broad. Besides these,
they have other mean hovels, which, I conceived, were only to sleep in. Some of these stood in a
plantation, and I was given to understand, that in one of them lay a dead corpse. They made signs
that described sleep, or death; and circumstances pointed out the latter. Curious to see all I
could, I prevailed on an elderly man to go with me to the hut, which was separated from the others
by a reed fence, built quite round it at the distance of four or five feet. The entrance was by a
space in the fence, made so low as to admit one to step over. The two sides and one end of the hut
were closed or built up in the same manner, and with the same materials, as the roof. The other end
had been open, but was now well closed with mats, which I could not prevail on the man to remove, or
suffer me to do it. There hung at this end of the hut a matted bag or basket, in which was a piece
of roasted yam, and some sort of leaves, all quite fresh. I had a strong desire to see the inside of
the hut but the man was peremptory in refusing this, and even shewed an unwillingness to permit me
to look into the basket. He wore round his neck, fastened to a string, two or three locks of human
hair; and a woman present had several about her neck. I offered something in exchange for them, but
they gave me to understand they could not part with them, as it was the hair of the person who lay
in the hut. Thus I was led to believe that these people dispose of their dead in a manner similar to
that of Otaheite. The same custom of wearing the hair is observed by the people of that island, and
also by the New Zealanders. The former make tamau of the hair of their deceased friends, and the
latter make ear-rings and necklaces of their teeth.</p><p>Near most of their large houses were fixed, upright in the ground, the stems of four cocoa-nut
trees, in a square position, about three feet from each other. Some of our gentlemen who first saw
them, were inclined to believe they were thus placed on a religious account; but I was now satisfied
that it was for no other purpose but to hang cocoa-nuts on to dry. For when I asked, as well as I
could, the use of them, a man took me to one, loaded with cocoa-nuts from the bottom to the top; and
no words could have informed me better. Their situation is well chosen for this use, as most of
their large houses are built in an open airy place, or where the wind has a free passage, from
whatever direction it blows. Near most, if not all of them, is a large tree or two, whose spreading
branches afford an agreeable retreat from the scorching sun. This part of the island was well
cultivated, open and airy; the plantations were laid out by line, abounding wilh plantains,
sugar-canes, yams and other roots, and stocked with fruit-trees. In our walk we met with our old
friend Paowang, who, with some others, accompanied us to the water side, and brought with them, as a
present, a few yams and cocoa-nuts.</p><p>On the 15th, having finished wooding and watering, a few hands only were on shore making brooms,
the rest being employed on board setting up the rigging, and putting the ship in a condition for
sea. Mr Forster, in his botanical excursion this day, shot a pigeon, in the craw of which was a wild
nutmeg. He took some pains to find the tree, but his endeavours were without success. In the evening
a party of us walked to the eastern sea-shore, in order to take the bearing of Annattom, and Erronan
or Footoona. The horizon proved so hazy that I could see neither; but one of the natives gave me, as
I afterwards found, the true direction of them. We observed that in all, or most of their sugar
plantations, were dug holes or pits, four feet deep, and five or six in diameter; and on our
enquiring their use, we were given to understand that they caught rats in them. These animals, which
are very destructive to the canes, are here in great plenty. The canes, I observed, were planted as
thick as possible round the edge of these pits, so that the rats in coming at them are the more
liable to tumble in.</p><p>Next morning we found the tiller sprung in the rudder head, and, by some strange neglect, we had
not a spare one on board, which we were ignorant of till now it was wanting. I knew but of one tree
in the neighbourhood fit for this purpose, which I sent the carpenter on shore to look at, and an
officer, with a party of men, to cut it down, provided he could obtain leave of the natives; if not,
he was ordered to acquaint me. He understood that no one had any objection, and set the people to
work accordingly. But as the tree was large, this required some time; and, before it was down, word
was brought me that our friend Paowang was not pleased. Upon this I gave orders to desist, as we
found that, by scarfing a piece to the inner end of the tiller, and letting it farther into the
rudder-head, it would still perform its office. But as it was necessary to have a spare one on
board, I went on shore, sent for Paowang, made him a present of a dog and a piece of cloth, and then
explained to him that our great steering paddle was broken, and that I wanted that tree to make a
new one. It was easy to see how well pleased every one present was, with the means I took to obtain
it. With one voice they gave their consent, Paowang joining his also, which he perhaps could not
have done without the others; for I do not know that he had either more property, or more authority,
than the rest. This point being obtained, I took our friend on board to dinner, and after it was
over, went with him ashore, to pay a visit to an old chief, who was said to be king of the island;
which was a doubt with me. Paowang took little or no notice of him. I made him a present, after
which he immediately went away, as if he got all he came for. His name was Geogy, and they gave him
the title of Areeke. He was very old, but had a merry open countenance. He wore round his waist a
broad red-and-white chequered belt, the materials and manufacture of which seemed the same as that
of Otaheite cloth; but this was hardly a mark of distinction. He had with him a son, not less than
forty-five or fifty years of age. A great number of people were at this time at the landing-place,
most of them from distant parts. The behaviour of many was friendly; while others were daring and
insolent, which I thought proper to put up with, as our stay was nearly at an end.</p><p>On the 17th, about <time>ten o'clock</time>, I went ashore, and found in the crowd old Geogy and his son, who
soon made me understand that they wanted to dine with me; and accordingly I brought them and two
more on board. They all called them Areekees (or kings); but I doubt if any of them had the least
pretensions to that title over the whole island. It had been remarked, that one of these kings had
not authority enough to order one of the people up into a cocoa-nut tree, to bring him down some
nuts. Although he spoke to several, he was at last obliged to go himself, and, by way of revenge, as
it was thought, left not a nut on the tree, taking what he wanted himself, and giving the rest to
some of our people.</p><p>When I got them on board, I went with them all over the ship, which they viewed with uncommon
surprise and attention. We happened to have for their entertainment a kind of pie or pudding made of
plantains, and some sort of greens which we had got from one of the natives. On this and on yams
they made a hearty dinner; for, as to the salt beef and pork, they would hardly taste them. In the
<time>afternoon</time>, having made each of them a present of a hatchet, a spike-nail, and some medals, I
conducted them ashore.</p><p>Mr Forster and I then went over to the other side of the harbour, and, having tried, with
Fahrenheit's thermometer, the head of one of the hot springs, we found that the mercury rose to
191°. At this time the tide was up within two or three feet of the spring, so that we judged, it
might, in some degree, be cooled by it. We were mistaken however, for on repeating the experiment
next morning, when the tide was out, the mercury rose no higher than 187°; but, at another spring,
where the water bubbled out of the sand from under the rock at the S.W. corner of the harbour, the
mercury in the same thermometer rose to 202°-1/2, which is but little colder than boiling water. The
hot places before mentioned are from about three to four hundred feet perpendicular above these
springs, and on the slope of the same ridge with the volcano; that is, there are no vallies between
them, but such as are formed in the ridge itself; nor is the volcano on the highest part of the
ridge, but on the S.E. side of it. This is, I have been told, contrary to the general opinion of
philosophers, who say that volcanos must be on the summits of the highest hills. So far is this from
being the case on this island, that some of its hills are more than double the height of that on
which the volcano is, and close to it. To these remarks I must add, that, in wet or moist weather,
the volcano was most violent. There seems to be room for some philosophical reasoning on these
phenomena of nature; but not having any talent that way, I must content myself with stating facts as
I found them, and leave the causes to men of more abilities.</p><p>The tiller was now finished; but, as the wind was unfavourable for sailing, the guard was sent on
shore on the 19th as before, and a party of men to cut up and bring off the remainder of the tree
from which we had got the tiller. Having nothing else to do, I went on shore with them, and finding
a good number of the natives collected about the landing-place as usual, I distributed among them
all the articles I had with me, and then went on board for more. In less than an hour I returned,
just as our people were getting some large logs into the boat. At the same time four or five of the
natives stepped forward to see what we were about, and as we did not allow them to come within
certain limits, unless to pass along the beach, the centry ordered them, back, which they readily
complied with. At this time, having my eyes fixed on them, I observed the sentry present his piece
(as I thought at these men,) and was just going to reprove him for it, because I had observed that,
whenever this was done, some of the natives would hold up their arms, to let us see they were
equally ready. But I was astonished beyond measure when the sentry fired, for I saw not the least
cause. At this outrage most of the people fled; it was only a few I could prevail on to remain. As
they ran off, I observed one man to fall; and he was immediately lifted up by two others, who took
him into the water, and washed his wound, and then led him off. Presently after, some came and
described to me the nature of his wound; and as I found he was not carried far, I sent for the
surgeon. As soon as he arrived, I went with him to the man, whom, we found expiring. The ball had
struck his left arm, which was much shattered, and then entered his body by the short ribs, one of
which was broken. The rascal who fired, pretended that a man had laid an arrow across his bow, and
was going to shoot at him, so that he apprehended himself in danger. But this was no more than they
had always done, and with no other view than to shew they were armed as well as we; at least I have
reason to think so, as they never went farther. What made this incident the more unfortunate was, it
not appearing to be the man who bent the bow, that was shot, but one who stood by him. This affair
threw the natives into the utmost consternation; and a few that were prevailed on to stay, ran to
the plantations and brought cocoa-nuts, etc. which they laid down at our feet. So soon, were those
daring people humbled! When I went on board to dinner, they all retired, and only a few appeared in
the <time>afternoon</time>, amongst whom were Paowang and Wha-a-gou. I had not seen this young man since the day
he had dined on board. Both he and Paowang promised to bring me fruit, etc. the next morning, but
our early departure put it out of their power.</p></div><div type="chapter"><head><l>CHAPTER VI.</l><l><emph>Departure from Tanna; with some Account of its Inhabitants, their Manners and
Arts.</emph></l></head><p><date>1774 August</date></p><p>During the night the wind had veered round to S.E. As this was favourable for getting out of the
harbour, at <time>four o'clock  in the morning</time> of the 20th, we began to unmoor, and at eight, having
weighed our last anchor, put to sea. As soon as we were clear of the land, I brought-to, waiting for
the launch, which was left behind to take up a kedge-anchor and hawser we had out, to cast by. About
day-break a noise was heard in the woods, nearly abreast of us, on the east side of the harbour, not
unlike singing of psalms. I was told that the like had been heard at the same time every morning,
but it never came to my knowledge till now, when it was too late to learn the occasion of it. Some
were of opinion, that at the east point of the harbour (where we observed, in coming in, some
houses, boats, etc.) was something sacred to religion, because some of our people had attempted to
go to this point, and were prevented by the natives. I thought, and do still think, it was owing to
a desire they shewed on every occasion, of fixing bounds to our excursions. So far as we had once
been, we might go again; but not farther with their consent. But by encroaching a little every time,
our country expeditions were insensibly extended without giving the least umbrage. Besides, these
morning ceremonies, whether religious or not, were not performed down at that point, but in a part
where some of our people had been daily.</p><p>I cannot say what might be the true cause of these people shewing such dislike to our going up
into their country. It might be owing to a naturally jealous disposition, or perhaps to their being
accustomed to hostile visits from their neighbours, or quarrels among themselves. Circumstances
seemed to shew that such must frequently happen; for we observed them very expert in arms, and well
accustomed to them; seldom or never travelling without them. It is possible all this might be on our
account; but I hardly think it. We never gave them the least molestation, nor did we touch any part
of their property, not even the wood and water, without first having obtained their consent. The
very cocoa-nuts, hanging over the heads of the workmen, were as safe as those in the middle of the
island. It happened rather fortunately, that there were so many cocoa-nut trees, near the skirts of
the harbour, which seemed not to be private property; so that we could generally prevail on the
natives to bring us some of these nuts, when nothing would induce them to bring any out of the
country.</p><p>We were not wholly without refreshments; for besides the fish, which our seine now and then
provided us with, we procured daily some fruits or roots from the natives, though but little in
proportion to what we could consume. The reason why we got no more might be our having nothing to
give them in exchange, which they thought valuable. They had not the least knowledge of iron;
consequently, nails and iron tools, beads, etc. which had so great a run at the more eastern isles,
were of no consideration here; and cloth can be of no use to people who go naked.</p><p>The produce of this island is bread-fruit, plantains, cocoa-nuts, a fruit like a nectarine, yams,
tarra, a sort of potatoe, sugar-cane, wild figs, a fruit like an orange, which is not eatable, and
some other fruit and nuts whose names I have not. Nor have I any doubt that the nutmeg before
mentioned was the produce of this island. The bread-fruit, cocoa-nuts, and plantains, are neither so
plentiful nor so good as at Otaheite; on the other hand, sugar-canes and yams are not only in
greater plenty, but of superior quality, and much larger. We got one of the latter which weighed
fifty-six pounds, every ounce of which was good. Hogs did not seem to be scarce; but we saw not many
fowls. These are the only domestic animals they have. Land-birds are not more numerous than at
Otaheite, and the other islands; but we met with some small birds, with a very beautiful plumage,
which we had never seen before. There is as great a variety of trees and plants here, as at any
island we touched at, where our botanists had time to examine. I believe these people live chiefly
on the produce of the land, and that the sea contributes but little to their subsistence. Whether
this arises from the coast not abounding with fish, or from their being bad fishermen, I know not;
both causes perhaps concur. I never saw any sort of fishing-tackle amongst them, nor any one out
fishing, except on the shoals, or along the shores of the harbour, where they would watch to strike
with a dart such fish as came within their reach; and in this they were expert. They seemed much to
admire our catching fish with the seine; and, I believe, were not well pleased with it at last. I
doubt not, they have other methods of catching fish besides striking them.</p><p>We understood that the little isle of Immer was chiefly inhabited by fishermen, and that the
canoes we frequently saw pass, to and from that isle and the east point of the harbour, were fishing
canoes. These canoes were of unequal sizes, some thirty feet long, two broad, and three deep; and
they are composed of several pieces of wood clumsily sewed together with bandages. The joints are
covered on the outside by a thin batten champered off at the edges, over which the bandages pass.
They are navigated either by paddles or sails. The sail is lateen, extended to a yard and boom, and
hoisted to a short mast. Some of the large canoes have two sails, and all of them outriggers.</p><p>At first we thought the people of this island, as well as those of Erromango, were a race between
the natives of the Friendly Islands and those of Mallicollo; but a little acquaintance with them
convinced us that they had little or no affinity to either, except it be in their hair, which is
much like what the people of the latter island have. The general colours of it are black and brown,
growing to a tolerable length, and very crisp and curly. They separate it into small locks, which
they woold or cue round with the rind of a slender plant, down to about an inch of the ends; and, as
the hair grows, the woolding is continued. Each of these cues or locks is somewhat thicker than
common whipcord; and they look like a parcel of small strings hanging down from the crown of their
heads. Their beards, which are strong and bushy, are generally short. The women do not wear their
hair so, but cropped; nor do the boys, till they approach manhood. Some few men, women, and
children, were seen, who had hair like ours; but it was obvious that these were of another nation;
and, I think, we understood they came from Erronan. It is to this island they ascribe one of the two
languages which they speak, and which is nearly, if not exactly, the same as that spoken in the
Friendly Islands. It is therefore more than probable that Erronan was peopled from that nation, and
that by long intercourse with Tanna and the other neighbouring islands, each had learnt the other's
language, which they use indiscriminately.</p><p>The other language which the people of Tanna speak, and, as we understood, those of Erromango and
Annatom, is properly their own. It is different from any we had before met with, and bears no
affinity to that of Mallicollo; so that, it should seem, the people of these islands are a distinct
nation of themselves. Mallicollo, Apee, etc. were names entirely unknown to them; they even knew
nothing of Sandwich Island, which is much nearer. I took no small pains to know how far their
geographical knowledge extended; and did not find that it exceeded the limits of their horizon.</p><p>These people are of the middle size, rather slender than otherwise; many are little, but few tall
or stout; the most of them have good features, and agreeable countenances; are, like all the
tropical race, active and nimble; and seem to excel in the use of arms, but not to be fond of
labour. They never would put a hand to assist in any work we were carrying on, which the people of
the other islands used to delight in. Bat what I judge most from, is their making the females do the
most laborious work, as if they were pack-horses. I have seen a woman carrying a large bundle on her
back, or a child on her back and a bundle under her arm, and a fellow strutting before her with
nothing but a club or spear, or some such thing. We have frequently observed little troops of women
pass, to and fro, along the beach, laden with fruit and roots, escorted by a party of men under
arms; though, now and then, we have seen a man carry a burden at the same time, but not often. I
know not on what account this was done, nor that an armed troop was necessary. At first, we thought
they were moving out of the neighbourhood with their effects, but we afterwards saw them both carry
out, and bring in, every day.</p><p>I cannot say the women are beauties, but I think them handsome enough for the men, and too
handsome for the use that is made of them. Both sexes are of a very dark colour, but not black; nor
have they the least characteristic of the negro about them. They make themselves blacker than they
really are, by painting their faces with a pigment of the colour of black-lead. They also use
another sort which is red, and a third sort brown, or a colour between red and black. All these, but
especially the first, they lay on with a liberal hand, not only on the face, but on the neck,
shoulders, and breast. The men wear nothing but a belt, and the wrapping leaf as at Mallicollo. The
women have a kind of petticoat made of the filaments of the plantain-tree, flags, or some such
thing, which reaches below the knee. Both sexes wear ornaments, such as bracelets, ear-rings,
necklaces, and amulets. The bracelets are chiefly worn by the men; some made of sea-shells, and
others of those of the cocoa-nut. The men also wear amulets; and those of most value being made of a
greenish stone, the green stone of New Zealand is valued by them for this purpose. Necklaces are
chiefly used by the women, and made mostly of shells. Ear-rings are common to both sexes, and those
valued most are made of tortoise-shell. Some of our people having got some at the Friendly Islands,
brought it to a good market here, where it was of more value than any thing we had besides; from
which I conclude that these people catch but few turtle, though I saw one in the harbour, just as we
were getting under sail. I observed that, towards the latter end of our stay, they began to ask for
hatchets, and large nails, so that it is likely they had found that iron is more serviceable than
stone, bone, or shells, of which all their tools I have seen are made. Their stone hatchets, at
least all those I saw, are not in the shape of adzes, as at the other islands, but more like an axe.
In the helve, which is pretty thick, is made a hole into which the stone is fixed.</p><p>These people, besides the cultivation of ground, have few other arts worth mentioning. They know
how to make a coarse kind of matting, and a coarse cloth of the bark of a tree, which is used
chiefly for belts. The workmanship of their canoes, I have before observed, is very rude; and their
arms, with which they take the most pains in point of neatness, come far short of some others we
have seen. Their weapons are clubs, spears or darts, bows and arrows, and stones. The clubs are of
three or four kinds, and from three to five feet long. They seem to place most dependence on the
darts, which are pointed with three bearded edges. In throwing them they make use of a becket, that
is, a piece of stiff plaited cord about six inches long, with an eye in one end and a knot at the
other. The eye is fixed on the fore-finger of the right hand, and the other end is hitched round the
dart, where it is nearly on an equipoise. They hold the dart between the thumb and remaining
fingers, which serve only to give it direction, the velocity being communicated by the becket and
fore-finger. The former flies off from the dart the instant its velocity becomes greater than that
of the hand. But it remains on the finger ready to be used again. With darts they kill both birds
and fish, and are sure of hitting a mark, within the compass of the crown of a hat, at the distance
of eight or ten yards; but, at double that distance, it is chance if they hit a mark the size of a
man's body, though they will throw the weapon sixty or seventy yards. They always throw with all
their might, let the distance be what it will. Darts, bows and arrows are to them what musquets are
to us. The arrows are made of reeds pointed with hard wood; some are bearded and some not, and those
for shooting birds have two, three, and sometimes four points. The stones they use are, in general,
the branches of coral rocks from eight to fourteen inches long, and from an inch to an inch-and-half
in diameter. I know not if they employ them as missive weapons; almost every one of them carries a
club, and besides that, either darts, or a bow and arrows, but never both; those who had stones kept
them generally in their belts.</p><p>I cannot conclude this account of their arms without adding an entire passage out of Mr Wales's
journal. As this gentleman was continually on shore amongst them, he had a better opportunity of
seeing what they could perform, than any of us. The passage is as follows: "I must confess I have
been often led to think the feats which Homer represents his heroes as performing with their spears,
a little too much of the marvellous to be admitted into an heroic poem; I mean when confined within
the strait stays of Aristotle. Nay, even so great an advocate for him as Mr Pope, acknowledges them
to be <emph>surprising</emph>. But since I have seen what these people can do with their wooden
spears, and them badly pointed, and not of a very hard nature, I have not the least exception to any
one passage in that great poet on this account. But, if I see fewer exceptions, I can find
infinitely more beauties in him; as he has, I think, scarce an action, circumstance, or description
of any kind whatever, relating to a spear, which I have not seen and recognised among these people;
as their whirling motion, and whistling noise, as they fly; their quivering motion, as they stick in
the ground when they fall; their meditating their aim, when they are going to throw, and their
shaking them in their hand as they go along, etc. etc."</p><p>I know no more of their cookery, than that it consists of roasting and baking; for they have no
vessel in which water can be boiled. Nor do I know that they have any other liquor but water and the
juice of the cocoa-nut.</p><p>We are utter strangers to their religion; and but little acquainted with their government. They
seem to have chiefs among them; at least some were pointed out to us by that title; but, as I before
observed, they appeared to have very little authority over the rest of the people. Old Geogy was the
only one the people were ever seen to take the least notice of; but whether this was owing to high
rank or old age, I cannot say. On several occasions I have seen the old men respected and obeyed.
Our friend Paowang was so; and yet I never heard him called chief, and have many reasons to believe
that he had not a right to any more authority than many of his neighbours, and few, if any, were
bound to obey him, or any other person in our neighbourhood; for if there had been such a one, we
certainly should, by some means, have known it. I named the harbour Port Resolution, after the ship,
she being the first which ever entered it. It is situated on the north side of the most eastern
point of the island, and about E.N.E. from the volcano; in the latitude of<geo select="lat">19° 32' 25.5" S</geo>., and
in the longitude of <geo select="lon">169° 44' 35" E</geo>. It is no more than a little creek running in S. by W. 1/2 W.
three quarters of a mile, and is about half that in breadth. A shoal of sand and rocks, lying on the
east side, makes it still narrower. The depth of water in the harbour is from six to three fathoms,
and the bottom is sand and mud. No place can be more convenient for taking in wood and water; for
both are close to the shore. The water stunk a little after it had been a few days on board, but it
afterwards turned sweet; and even when it was at the worst, the tin machine would, in a few hours,
recover a whole cask. This is an excellent contrivance for sweetening water at sea, and is well
known in the navy.</p><p>Mr Wales, from whom I had the latitude and longitude, found the variation of the needle to be 7°
14' 12" E., and the dip of its south end 45° 2' 3/4. He also observed the time of high water, on the
full and change days, to be about 5h 45m; and the tide to rise and fall three feet.</p></div><div type="chapter"><head><l>CHAPTER VII.</l><l><emph>The Survey of the Islands continued, and a more particular Description of
them.</emph></l></head><p><date>1774 August</date></p><p>As soon as the boats were hoisted in, we made sail, and stretched to the eastward, with a fresh
gale at S.E., in order to have a nearer view of Erronan, and to see if there was any land in its
neighbourhood. We stood on till midnight, when, having passed the island, we tacked, and spent the
remainder of the night making two boards. At sun-rise on the 21st, we stood S.W., in order to get to
the south of Tanna, and nearer to Annatom, to observe if any more land lay in that direction; for an
extraordinary clear morning had produced no discovery of any to the east. At <time>noon</time>, having observed
in latitude <geo select="lat">20° 33' 30" S</geo>, the situation of the lands around us was as follows: Port Resolution bore
north 86° W., distant six and a half leagues; the island of Tanna extended from S. 88° W., to N. 64°
W.; Traitor's Head N. 58° W., distant twenty leagues; the island of Erronan N. 80° E., distant five
leagues; and Annatom from S. 1/2 E. to S. 1/2 W., distant ten leagues. We continued to stretch to
the south till <time>two o'clock</time> p.m. when, seeing no more land before us, we bore up round the S.E. end
of Tanna; and, with a fine gale at E.S.E., ran along the south coast at one league from shore. It
seemed a bold one, without the guard of any rocks; and the country full as fertile as in the
neighbourhood of the harbour, and making a fine appearance. At <time>six o'clock</time> the high land of
Erromango appeared over the west end of Tanna in the direction of 10° W.; at <time>eight o'clock</time> we were
past the island, and steered N.N.W. for Sandwich Island, in order to finish the survey* of it, and
of the isles to the N.W. On the 22d, at <time>four o'clock</time> p.m., we drew near the S.E. end, and ranging
the south coast, found it to trend in the direction of W. and W.N.W. for about nine leagues. Near
the middle of this length, and close to the shore, are three or four small isles, behind which
seemed to be a safe anchorage. But not thinking I had any time to spare to visit this fine island, I
continued to range the coast to its western extremity, and then steered N.N.W, from the S.E. end of
Mallicollo, which, at half past <time>six o'clock</time> next morning, bore N. 14° E., distant seven or eight
leagues, and Three-Hills Island S. 82° E. Soon after, we saw the islands Apee, Paom, and Ambrym.
What we had comprehended under the name of Paom appeared now to be two isles, something like a
separation being seen between the hill and the land to the west of it. We approached the S.W. side
of Mallicollo to within half a league, and ranged it at that distance. From the S.E. point, the
direction of the land is west, a little southerly, for six or seven leagues, and then N.W. by W.
three leagues, to a pretty high point or head-land, situated in latitude <geo select="lat">16° 29' S</geo>, and which obtained
the name of South-west Cape. The coast, which is low, seemed to be indented into creeks and
projecting points; or else, these points were small isles lying under the shore. We were sure of
one, which lies between two and three leagues east of the Cape. Close to the west side or point of
the Cape, lies, connected with it by breakers, a round rock or islet, which helps to shelter a fine
bay, formed by an elbow in the coast, from the reigning winds.</p><p>[* The word Survey is not here to be understood in its literal sense. Surveying a place,
according to my idea, is taking a geometrical plan of it, in which every place is to have its true
situation, which cannot be done in a work of this nature.]</p><p>The natives appeared in troops on many parts of the shore, and some seemed desirous to come off
to us in canoes, but they did not; and, probably, our not shortening sail, was the reason. From the
South-west Cape, the direction of the coast is N. by W.; but the most advanced land bore from it
N.W. by N., at which the land seemed to terminate. Continuing to follow the direction of the coast,
at <time>noon</time> it was two miles from us; and our latitude, by observation, was <geo select="lat">16° 22' 30" S</geo>. This is
nearly the parallel to Port Sandwich, and our never-failing guide, the watch, shewed that we were
26' west of it; a distance which the breadth of Mallicollo cannot exceed in this parallel. The
South-east Cape bore S. 26° E., distant seven miles; and the most advanced point of land, for which
we steered, bore N.W. by N. At <time>three o'clock</time>, we were the length of it, and found the land
continued, and trending more and more to the north. We coasted it to its northern extremity, which
we did not reach till after dark, at which time we were near enough to the shore to hear the voices
of people, who were assembled round a fire they had made on the beach. There we sounded, and found
twenty fathoms and a bottom of sand; but, on edging off from the shore, we soon got out of sounding,
and then made a trip back to the south till the moon got up. After this we stood again to the north,
hauled round the point, and spent the night in Bougainville's passage; being assured of our
situation before sun-set, by seeing the land, on the north side of the passage, extending as far as
N.W. 1/2 W.</p><p>The south coast of Mallicollo, from the S.E. end to the S.W. Cape, is luxuriantly clothed with
wood, and other productions of nature, from the sea-shore to the very summits of the hills. To the
N.W. of the Cape the country is less woody, but more agreeably interspersed with lawns, some of
which appeared to be cultivated. The summits of the hills seemed barren; and the highest lies
between Port Sandwich and the S.W. Cape. Farther north the land falls insensibly lower, and is less
covered with wood. I believe it is a very fertile island, and well inhabited; for we saw smoke by
day and fire by night, in all parts of it.</p><p>Next morning at sun-rise, we found ourselves nearly in the middle of the passage, the N.W. end of
Mallicollo extending from S. 30° E., to S. 58° W.; the land to the north from N. 70° W. to N. 4° E.;
and the Isle of Lepers bearing N. 30° E., distant eleven or twelve leagues. We now made sail, and
steered N. by E., and afterwards north, along the east coast of the northern land, with a fine
breeze at S.E. We found that this coast, which at first appeared to be continued, was composed of
several low woody isles, the most of them of small extent, except the southernmost, which, on
account of the day, I named St Bartholomew. It is six or seven leagues in circuit, and makes the
N.E. point of Bougainville's Passage. At <time>noon</time> the breeze began to slacken. We were at this time
between two and three miles from the land, and observed in latitude <geo select="lat">15° 23' S</geo> the Isle of Lepers
bearing from E. by N. to S., distance seven leagues; and a high bluff-head, at which the coast we
were upon seemed to terminate, N.N.W. 1/2 W., distant ten or eleven leagues; but from the mast-head
we could see land to the east. This we judged to be an island, and it bore N. by W. 1/2 W.</p><p>As we advanced to N.N.W., along a fine coast covered with woods, we perceived low land that
extended off from the bluff-head towards the island above mentioned, but did not seem to join it. It
was my intention to have gone through the channel, but the approach of night made me lay it aside,
and steer without the island. During the <time>afternoon</time>, we passed some small isles lying under the
shore; and observed some projecting points of unequal height, but were not able to determine whether
or no they were connected with the main land. Behind them was a ridge of hills which terminated at
the bluff-head. There were cliffs, in some places of the coast, and white patches, which we judged
to be chalk. At <time>ten o'clock</time>, being the length of the isle which lies off the head, we shortened
sail, and spent the night in making short boards.</p><p>At day-break on the 25th, we were on the north side of the island (which is of a moderate height,
and three leagues in circuit,) and steered west for the bluff-head, along the low land under it. At
sun-rise an elevated coast came in sight beyond the bluff-head, extending to the north as far N.W.
by W. After doubling the head we found the land to trend south, a little easterly, and to form a
large deep bay, bounded on the west by the coast just mentioned.</p><p>Every thing conspired to make us believe this was the Bay of St Philip and St Jago, discovered by
Quiros in 1606. To determine this point, it was necessary to proceed farther up; for at this time we
saw no end to it. The wind being at south, we were obliged to ply, and first stretched over for the
west shore, from which we were three miles at <time>noon</time>, when our latitude was <geo select="lat">14° 55' 30" S</geo>., longitude
<geo select="lon">167° 3' E</geo>.; the mouth of the bay extending from N. 64° W., to S. 86° E., which last direction was
the bluff-head, distant three leagues. In the <time>afternoon</time> the wind veering to E.S.E., we could look up
to the head of the bay; but as the breeze was faint, a N.E. swell hurtled us over to the west shore;
so that, at half past <time>four o'clock</time> p.m., we were no more than two miles from it, and tacked in one
hundred and twenty fathoms water, a soft muddy bottom. The bluff-head, or east point of the bay,
bore north <geo select="lon">53° E</geo>ast.</p><p>We had no sooner tacked than it fell calm, and we were left to the mercy of the swell, which
continued to hurtle us towards the shore, where large troops of people were assembled. Some ventured
off in two canoes; but all the signs of friendship we could make, did not induce them to come
along-side, or near enough to receive any present from us. At last they took sudden fright at
something, and returned ashore. They were naked, except having some long grass, like flags, fastened
to a belt, and hanging down before and behind, nearly as low as the knee. Their colour was very
dark, and their hair woolly, or cut short, which made it seem so. The canoes were small and had
outriggers. The calm continued till near <time>eight o'clock</time>, in which time we drove into eighty-five
fathoms water, and so near the shore that I expected we should be obliged to anchor. A breeze of
wind sprung up at E.S.E., and first took us on the wrong side; but, contrary to all our
expectations, and when we had hardly room to veer, the ship came about, and having filled on the
starboard tack, we stood off N.E. Thus we were relieved from the apprehensions of being forced to
anchor in a great depth, on a lee shore, and in a dark and obscure night.</p><p>We continued to ply upwards, with variable light breezes between E.S.E. and S., till ten next
morning, when it fell calm. We were, at this time, about seven or eight miles from the head of the
bay, which is terminated by a low beach; and behind that, is an extensive flat covered with wood,
and bounded on each side by a ridge of mountains. At <time>noon</time> we found the latitude to be <geo select="lat">15° 5' S</geo>., and
were detained here by the calm till <time>one o'clock</time> p.m., when we got a breeze at N. by W., with which
we steered up to within two miles of the head of the bay; and then I sent Mr Cooper and Mr Gilbert
to sound and reconnoitre the coast, while we stood to and fro with the ship. This gave time to three
sailing canoes which had been following us some time, to come up. There were five or six men in
each; and they approached near enough to receive such things as were thrown to them fastened to a
rope, but would not advance alongside. They were the same sort of people as those we had seen the
preceding evening; indeed we thought they came from the same place. They seemed to be stouter and
better shaped men than those of Mallicollo; and several circumstances concurred to make us think
they were of another nation. They named the numerals as far as five or six in the language of
Anamocka, and understood us when we asked the names of the adjacent lands in that language. Some,
indeed, had black short frizzled hair like the natives of Mallicollo, but others had it long, tied
up on the crown of the head, and ornamented with feathers like the New Zealanders. Their other
ornaments were bracelets and necklaces; one man had something like a white shell on his forehead,
and some were painted with a blackish pigment. I did not see that they had any other weapon but
darts and gigs, intended only for striking of fish. Their canoes were much like those of Tanna, and
navigated in the same manner, or nearly so. They readily gave us the names of such parts as we
pointed to; but we could not obtain from them the name of the island. At length, seeing our boats
coming, they paddled in for the shore, notwithstanding all we could say or do to detain them.</p><p>When the boats returned, Mr Cooper informed me, that they had landed on the beach which is at the
head of the bay, near a fine river, or stream of fresh water, so large and deep that they judged
boats might enter it at high water. They found three fathoms depth close to the beach, and
fifty-five and fifty, two cables' length off. Farther out they did not sound; and where we were with
the ship, we had no soundings with a hundred and seventy fathoms line. Before the boats got on
board, the wind had shifted to the S.S.E. As we were in want of nothing, and had no time to spare, I
took the advantage of this shift of wind, and steered down the bay. During the fore-part of the
night, the country was illuminated with fires, from the sea-shore to the summits of the mountains;
but this was only on the west side of the shore. I cannot pretend to say what was the occasion of
these fires, but have no idea of their being on our account. Probably, they were burning or clearing
the ground for new plantations. At day-break on the 27th, we found ourselves two-thirds down the
bay, and, as we had but little wind, it was <time>noon</time> before we were the length of the N.W. point, which
at this time bore N. 82° W., distant five miles. Latitude observed 14° 39' 30".</p><p>Some of our gentlemen were doubtful of this being the bay of St Philip and St Jago, as there was
no place which they thought could mean the port of Vera Cruz. For my part I found general points to
agree so well with Quiros's description, that I had not the least doubt about it. As to what he
calls the Port of Vera Cruz, I understand that to be the anchorage at the head of the bay, which in
some places may extend farther off than where our boats landed. There is nothing in his account of
the port which contradicts this supposition*. It was but natural for his people to give a name to
the place, independent of so large a bay, where they lay so long at anchor. A port is a vague term,
like many others in geography, and has been very often applied to places far less sheltered than
this.</p><p>[See Quiros's Voyage, in Dalrymple's Collection, vol i, p.136, 137.]</p><p>Our officers observed that grass and other plants grew on the beach close to high water-mark,
which is always a sure sign of pacific anchorage, and an undeniable proof that there never is a
great surf on the shore. They judged that the tide rose about four or five feet, and that boats and
such craft might, at high-water, enter the river, which seemed to be pretty deep and broad within;
so that this, probably, is one of those mentioned by Quiros; and if we were not deceived, we saw the
other.</p><p>The bay hath twenty leagues sea-coast, six on the east side, which lies in the direction of S.
half W. and N. half E., two at the head, and twelve on the west side, the direction of which is S.
by E. and N. by W., from the head down to two-thirds of its length, and then N.W. by N. to the N.W.
point. The two points which form the entrance, lie in the direction of S. 53° E., and N. 53° W.,
from each other, distant ten leagues. The bay is every where free from danger, and of an
unfathomable depth, except near the shores, which are for the most part low. This, however, is only
a very narrow strip between the sea-shore and the foot of the hills; for the bay, as well as the
flat land at the head of it, is bounded on each side by a ridge of hills, one of which, that to the
west, is very high and double, extending the whole length of the island. An uncommonly luxuriant
vegetation was every where to be seen; the sides of the hills were chequered with plantations; and
every valley watered by a stream. Of all the productions of nature this country was adorned with,
the cocoa-nut trees were the most conspicuous. The columns of smoke we saw by day, and fires by
night all over the country, led us to believe that it is well inhabited and very fertile. The east
point of this bay, which I name Cape Quiros, in memory of its first discoverer, is situated in
latitude <geo select="lat" n="1">14° 56' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">167° 13' E</geo>. The N.W. point, which I named Cape Cumberland, in honour
of his Royal Highness the Duke, lies in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="2">14° 38.75' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="2">166° 49.5' E</geo>.,
and is the N.W. extremity of this archipelago; for, after doubling it, we found the coast to trend
gradually round to the S. and S.S.E.</p><p>On the 28th and 29th, we had light airs and calms, so that we advanced but little. In this time,
we took every opportunity, when the horizon was clearer than usual, to look out for more land, but
none was seen. By Quiros's track to the north, after leaving the bay above-mentioned, it seems
probable that there is none nearer than Queen Charlotte's Island, discovered by Captain Carteret,
which lies about ninety leagues N.N.W. from Cape Cumberland, and I take to be the same with Quiros's
Santa Cruz.</p><p>On the 30th, the calm was succeeded by a fresh breeze at S.S.E. which enabled us to ply up the
coast. At <time>noon</time> we observed in 15° 20'; afterwards we stretched in east, to within a mile of the
shore, and then tacked in seventy-five fathoms, before a sandy flat, on which several of the natives
made their appearance. We observed on the sides of the hills, several plantations that were laid out
by line, and fenced round.</p><p>On the 31st, at <time>noon</time>, the S. or S.W. point of the island bore N. 62° E., distant four leagues.
This forms the N.W. point of what I call Bougainville's Passage; the N.E. point at this time bore N.
85° E., and the N.W. end of Mallicollo from S. 54° E. to S. 72° E. Latitude observed <geo select="lat">15° 45' S</geo>. In
the <time>afternoon</time>, in stretching to the east, we weathered the S.S.W. point of the island, from which
the coast trends east, northerly. It is low, and seemed to form some creeks or coves; and, as we got
farther into the passage, we perceived some small low isles lying along it, which seemed to extend
behind St Bartholomew Island.</p><p>Having now finished the survey of the whole archipelago, the season of the year made it necessary
for me to return to the south, while I had yet some time left to explore any land I might meet with
between this and New Zealand; where I intended to touch, that I might refresh my people, and recruit
our stock of wood and water for another southern course. With this view, at five p.m. we tacked, and
hauled to the southward with a fresh gale at S.E. At this time the N.W. point of the passage, or the
S.W. point of the island Tierra del Espiritu Santo, the only remains of Quiros's continent, bore N.
82° W., distant three leagues. I named it Cape Lisburne, and its situation is in latitude <geo select="lat">15° 40' S</geo>,
longitude <geo select="lon">165° 59' E</geo>.</p><p>The foregoing account of these islands, in the order in which we explored them, not being
particular enough either as to situation or description, it may not be improper now to give a more
accurate view of them, which will convey to the reader a better idea of the whole groupe.</p><p>The northern islands of this archipelago were first discovered by that great navigator Quiros in
1606; and, not without reason, were considered as part of the southern continent, which, at that
time, and until very lately, was supposed to exist. They were next visited by M. de Bougainville, in
1768; who, besides landing on the Isle of Lepers, did no more than discover that the land was not
connected, but composed of islands, which he called the Great Cyclades. But as, besides ascertaining
the extent and situation of these islands, we added to them several new ones which were not known
before, and explored the whole, I think we have obtained a right to name them; and shall in future
distinguish them by the name of the New Hebrides. They are situated between the latitude of <geo select="lat">14° 29' S</geo> 
and <geo select="lat" n="1">20° 4' S</geo>., and between <geo select="lon">166° 41' E</geo> and <geo select="lon" n="1">170° 21' E</geo>. longitude, and extend an hundred and twenty-five
leagues in the direction of N.N.W. 1/2 W. and S.S.E. 1/2 E.</p><p>The most northern island is that called by M. de Bougainville, Peak of the Etoile; it is
situated, according to his account, in latitude, <geo select="lat" n="1">14° 29' S</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">168° 9' E</geo>; and N. by W., eight
leagues from Aurora.</p><p>The next island, which lies farthest north, is that of Tierra del Espiritu Santo. It is the most
western and largest of all the Hebrides, being twenty-two leagues long, in the direction of N.N.W.
1/2 W. and S.S.E. 1/2 E., twelve in breadth, and sixty in circuit. We have obtained the true figure
of this island very accurately. The land of it, especially the west side, is exceedingly high and
mountainous; and, in many places the hills rise directly from the sea. Except the cliffs and
beaches, every other part is covered with wood, or laid out in plantations. Besides the bay of St
Philip and St Jago, the isles which lie along the south and east coast, cannot, in my opinion, fail
of forming some good bays or harbours.</p><p>The next considerable island is that of Mallicollo. To the S.E. it extends N.W. and S.E., and is
eighteen leagues long in that direction. Its greatest breadth, which is at the S.E., end, is eight
leagues. The N.W. end is two-thirds this breadth, and near the middle, one-third. This contraction
is occasioned by a wide and pretty deep bay on the S.W. side. To judge of this island from what we
saw of it, it must be very fertile and well inhabited. The land on the sea-coast is rather low, and
lies with a gentle slope from the hills which are in the middle of the island. Two-thirds of the
N.E. coast was only seen at a great distance; therefore the delineations of it can have no
pretensions to accuracy; but the other parts, I apprehend, are without any material errors.</p><p>St Bartholomew lies between the S.E. end of Tierra del Espiritu Santo, and the north end of
Mallicollo; and the distance between it and the latter is eight miles. This is the passage through
which M. de Bougainville went; and the middle of it is in latitude <geo select="lat">15° 48' S</geo>.</p><p>The Isle of Lepers lies between Espiritu Santo and Aurora Island, eight leagues from the former,
and three from the latter, in latitude <geo select="lat">15° 22' S</geo>, and nearly under the same meridian as the S.E.. end
of Mallicollo. It is of an egg-like figure, very high, and eighteen or twenty leagues in circuit.
Its limits were determined by several bearings; but the lines of the shore were traced out by guess,
except the N.E. part where there is anchorage half a mile from the land.</p><p>Aurora, Whitsuntide, Ambrym, Paoom, and its neighbour Apee, Threehills, and Sandwich Islands, lie
all nearly under the meridian of <geo select="lon" n="1">167° 29' E</geo> or <geo select="lon" n="2">167° 30.5' E</geo>., extending from the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="1">14° 51.5' S</geo>, to
<geo select="lat" n="2">17° 53.5' S</geo>.</p><p>The island of Aurora lies N. by W. and S. by E., and is eleven leagues long in that direction;
but I believe, it hardly any where exceeds two or two and a half in breadth. It hath a good height,
its surface hilly, and every where covered with wood, except where the natives have their dwellings
and plantations.</p><p>Whitsuntide Isle, which is one league and a half to the south of Aurora, is of the same length,
and lies in the direction of north and south, but is something broader than Aurora Island. It is
considerably high, and clothed with wood, except such parts as seemed to be cultivated, which were
pretty numerous.</p><p>From the south end of Whitsuntide Island to the north side of Ambrym is two leagues and a half.
This is about seventeen leagues in circuit; its shores are rather low, but the land rises with an
unequal ascent to a tolerably high mountain in the middle of the island, from which ascended great
columns of smoke; but we were not able to determine whether this was occasioned by a volcano or not.
That it is fertile and well inhabited, seems probable from the quantities of smoke which we saw rise
out of the woods, in such parts of the island as came within the compass of our sight; for it must
be observed, that we did not see the whole of it.</p><p>We saw still much less of Paoom and its neighbourhood. I can say no more of this island than that
it towers up to a great height in the form of a round hay-stack; and the extent of it, and of the
adjoining isle (if there are two), cannot exceed three or four leagues in any direction; for the
distance between Ambrym and Apee is hardly five; and they lie in this space, and east from Port
Sandwich, distant about seven or eight leagues.</p><p>The island of Apee is not less than twenty leagues in circuit; its longest direction is about
eight leagues N.W. and S.E.; it is of considerable height; and hath a hilly surface diversified with
woods and lawns, the west and south parts especially; for the others we did not see.</p><p>Shepherd's Isles are a group of small ones of unequal size, extending off from the S.E. point of
Apee about five leagues in the direction of S.E.</p><p>The island Threehills lies south four leagues from the coast of Apee, and S.E. 1/2 S., distant
seventeen leagues from Port Sandwich; to this, and what hath been already said of it, I shall only
add, that W. by N., five miles from the west point, is a reef of rocks on which the sea continually
breaks.</p><p>Nine leagues, in the direction of south, from Threehills, lies Sandwich Island. Twohills, the
Monument, and Montagu Islands, lie to the east of this line, and Hinchinbrook to the west, as also
two or three small isles which lie between it and Sandwich Island, to which they are connected by
breakers.</p><p>Sandwich Island is twenty-five leagues in circuit; its greatest extent is ten leagues; and it
lies in the direction of N.W. by W. and S.E. by E. The N.W. coast of this island we only viewed at a
distance; therefore our chart of this part may be faulty so far as it regards the line of the coast,
but no farther. The distance from the south end of Mallicollo to the N.W. end of Sandwich Island, is
twenty-two leagues in the direction of S.S.E. 1/2 E.</p><p>In the same direction lie Erromango, Tanna, and Annatom. The first is eighteen leagues from
Sandwich Island, and is twenty-four or twenty-five leagues in circuit. The middle of it lies in the
latitude of <geo select="lat">18° 54' S</geo> , longitude <geo select="lon">169° 19' E</geo>., and it is of a good height, as may be gathered from the
distance we were off when we first saw it.</p><p>Tanna lies six leagues from the south side of Erromango, extending S.E. by S. and N.W. by N.,
about eight leagues long in that direction, and every where about three or four leagues broad.</p><p>The isle of Immer lies in the direction of N. by E. 1/2 E., four leagues from Port Resolution in
Tanna; and the island of Erronan or Footoona East, in the same direction, distant eleven leagues.
This, which is the most eastern island of all the Hebrides, did not appear to be above five leagues
in circuit, but is of a considerable height and flat at top. On the N.E. side is a little peak
seemingly disjointed from the isle; but we thought it was connected by low land. Annatom, which is
the southernmost island, is situated in the latitude of <geo select="lat">20° 3' S</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon">170° 4' E</geo>, and S. 30° E.,
eleven or twelve leagues from Port Resolution. It is of a good height, with an hilly surface; and
more I must not say of it.</p><p>Here follow the lunar observations by Mr Wales, for ascertaining the longitude of these islands,
reduced by the watch to Port Sandwich in Mallicollo, and Port Resolution in Tanna.</p><table rows="11" cols="1"><row><cell>Port Sandwich, ( Mean of 10 sets of ob. before 167° 56' 33" 1/4 ) E.</cell></row><row><cell> ( 2 ditto, at 168 2 37 1/2 ) long</cell></row><row><cell>( 20 ditto, after 167 52 57 )</cell></row><row><cell>(_____________</cell></row><row><cell>( Mean of those means, 167 57 22 3/4</cell></row><row><cell/></row><row><cell>Port Resolution, ( Mean of 20 sets of ob. before 169 37 35 ) E.</cell></row><row><cell>( 5 ditto, at 169 48 48 ) long</cell></row><row><cell>( 20 ditto, after 169 47 22 1/2 )</cell></row><row><cell>(_____________</cell></row><row><cell>( Mean of these means, 169 44 33</cell></row></table><p>It is necessary to observe, that each set of observations, consisting of between six and ten
observed distances of the sun and moon, or moon and stars, the whole number amounts to several
hundreds; and these have been reduced by means of the watch to all the islands; so that the
longitude of each is as well ascertained as that of the two ports above-mentioned. As a proof of
this I shall only observe, that the longitude of the two ports, as pointed out by the watch and by
the observations, did not differ two miles. This also shews what degree of accuracy these
observations are capable of, when multiplied to a considerable number, made with different
instruments, and with the sun and stars, or both sides of the moon. By this last method, the errors
which may be either in the instruments or lunar tables, destroy one another, and likewise those
which may arise from the observer himself; for some men may observe closer than others. If we
consider the number of observations that may be obtained in the course of a month (if the weather is
favourable,) we shall perhaps find this method of finding the longitude of places as accurate as
most others; at least it is the most easy, and attended with the least expence to the observer.
Every ship that goes to foreign parts is, or maybe, supplied with a sufficient number of quadrants
at a small expence; I mean good ones, proper for making these observations. For the difference of
the price between a good and a bad one, I apprehend, can never be an object with an officer. The
most expensive article, and what is in some measure necessary in order to arrive at the utmost
accuracy, is a good watch; but for common use, and where that strict accuracy is not required, this
may be dispensed with. I have observed before, in this journal, that this method of finding the
longitude is not so difficult but that any man, with proper application, and a little practice, may
soon learn to make these observations as well as the astronomers themselves. I have seldom known any
material difference between the observations made by Mr Wales, and those made by the officers at the
same time*.</p><p>[See Vol I. p40. "Which is nearly the same difference as the day before…"]</p><p>In observing the variation of the magnetic needle, we found, as usual, our compasses differ among
themselves, sometimes near 2°; the same compass too, would sometimes make nearly this difference in
the variation on different days, and even between the morning and evening of the same day, when our
change of situation has been but very little. By the mean of the observations which I made about
Erromango; and the S.E. part of these islands, the variation of the compass was 10° 5' 48" E.; and
the mean of those made about Tierra del Espiritu Santo, gave 10° 5' 30" E<!--EB-B: Geocoders: this is NOT a longitude reading. 
These variations of the compass are magnetic declinations, the angle between true north and magnetic north, 
which fluctuates from place to place and over time, sometimes based on magnetic rock like iron ore beneath the earth's surface.-->. This is considerably more
than Mr Wales found it to be at Tanna. I cannot say what might occasion this difference in the
variation observed at sea and on shore, unless it be influenced by the land; for I must give the
preference to that found at sea, as it is agreeable to what we observed before we made the islands,
and after we left them.</p></div><div type="chapter"><head><l>CHAPTER VIII.</l><l><emph>An Account of the Discovery of New Caledonia, and the Incidents that happened while the
Ship lay in Balade.</emph></l></head><p><date>1774 September</date></p><p>At sun-rise on the 1st of September, after having stood to S.W. all night, no more land was to be
seen. The wind remaining in the S.E. quarter, we continued to stand to S.W. On the 2d, at five
o'clock, p.m., being in the latitude <geo select="lat" n="1">18° 22' S</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">165° 26' E</geo>, the variation was 10° 50' E.; and
at the same hour on the 3d, it was 10° 51', latitude at that time <geo select="lat" n="2">19° 14' S</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon" n="2">165° E</geo>. The
next morning, in the latitude of<geo select="lat" n="3"> 19° 49' S</geo>  longitude <geo select="lon" n="3">164° 53' E</geo>, the amplitude gave 10° 21', and the
azimuths 10° 7' E. At <time>eight o'clock</time>, as we were steering to the south, land was discovered bearing
S.S.W., and at <time>noon</time> it extended from S.S.E. to W. by S., distant about six leagues. We continued to
steer for it with a light breeze at east, till five in the evening, when we were stopped by a calm.
At this time we were three leagues from the land, which extended from S.E. by S. to W. by N., round
by the S.W. Some openings appeared in the west, so that we could not tell whether it was one
connected land or a group of islands. To the S.E. the coast seemed to terminate in a high
promontory, which I named Cape Colnett, after one of my midshipmen who first discovered this land.
Breakers were seen about half-way between us and the shore; and, behind them, two or three canoes
under sail, standing out to sea, as if their design had been to come off to us; but a little before
sun-set they struck their sails, and we saw them no more. After a few hours calm, we got a breeze at
S.E., and spent the night standing off and on.</p><p>On the 5th, at sun-rise, the horizon being clear, we could see the coast extend to the S.E. of
Cape Colnett, and round by the S.W. to N.W. by W. Some gaps or openings were yet to be seen to the
west; and a reef, or breakers, seemed to lie all along the coast, connected with those we discovered
the preceding night. It was a matter of indifference to me, whether we plied up the coast to the
S.E., or bore down to N.W. I chose the latter; and after running two leagues down the outside of the
reef (for such it proved) we came before an opening that had the appearance of a good channel,
through which we might go in for the land. I wanted to get at it, not only to visit it, but also to
have an opportunity to observe an eclipse of the sun which was soon to happen. With this view we
brought-to, hoisted out two armed boats, and sent them to sound the channel; ten or twelve large
sailing canoes being then near us. We had observed them coming off from the shore, all the morning,
from different parts; and some were lying on the reef, fishing, as we supposed. As soon as they all
got together, they came down to us in a body, and were pretty near when we were hoisting out our
boats, which probably gave them some alarm; for, without stopping, they hauled in for the reef, and
our boats followed them. We now saw that what we had taken for openings in the coast was low land,
and that it was all connected, except the western extremity, which was an island known by the name
of Balabea, as we afterwards learnt.</p><p>The boats having made a signal for a channel, and one of them being placed on the point of the
reef on the weather side of it, we stood in with the ship, and took up the other boat in our way,
when the officer informed me, that where we were to pass, was sixteen and fourteen fathoms water, a
fine sandy bottom, and that having put alongside two canoes, he found the people very obliging and
civil. They gave him some fish; and, in return, he presented them with medals, etc. In one was a
stout robust young man, whom, they understood to be a chief. After getting within the reef, we
hauled up S. 1/2 E., for a small low sandy isle that we observed lying under the shore, being
followed by all the canoes. Our sounding in standing in, was from fifteen to twelve fathoms (a
pretty even fine sandy bottom,) for about two miles; then we had six, five, and four fathoms. This
was on the tail of a shoal which lies a little without the small isle to the N.E. Being over it, we
found seven and eight fathoms water, which shallowed gradually as we approached the shore, to three
fathoms, when we tacked and stood off a little, and then anchored in five fathoms, the bottom a fine
sand mixed with mud. The little sandy isle bore E. by S., three-quarters of a mile distant; and we
were one mile from the shore of the main, which extended from S.E. by E., round to the south, to
W.N.W. The island of Balabea bore N.W. by N., and the channel, through which we came, north, four
miles distant. In this situation we were extremely well sheltered from the reigning winds, by the
sandy isle and its shoals, and by the shoal without them.</p><p>We had hardly got to an anchor, before we were surrounded by a great number of the natives, in
sixteen or eighteen canoes, the most of whom were without any sort of weapons. At first they were
shy in coming near the ship; but in a short time we prevailed on the people in one boat to get close
enough to receive some presents. These we lowered down to them by a rope, to which, in return, they
tied two fish that stunk intolerably, as did those they gave us in the morning. These mutual
exchanges bringing on a kind of confidence, two ventured on board the ship; and presently after, she
was filled with them, and we had the company of several at dinner in the cabin. Our pease-soup,
salt-beef and pork, they had no curiosity to taste; but they eat of some yams, which we happened to
have yet left, calling them <emph>Oobee</emph>. This name is not unlike <emph>Oofee</emph>, as they
are called at most of the islands, except Mallicollo; nevertheless, we found these people spoke a
language new to us. Like all the nations we had lately seen, the men were almost naked; having
hardly any other covering but such a wrapper as is used at Mallicollo*. They were curious in
examining every part of the ship, which they viewed with uncommon attention. They had not the least
knowledge of goats, hogs, dogs, or cats, and had not even a name for one of them. They seemed fond
of large spike-nails, and pieces of red cloth, or indeed of any other colour, but red was their
favourite.</p><p>[* The particular manner of applying the wrapper may be seen in Wafer's voyage, who mentions this
singular custom as existing, though with some little variation, amongst the Indians of the Isthmus
of Darien. See Wafer's Voyage, p. 140.]</p><p>After dinner, I went on shore with two armed boats, having with us one of the natives who had
attached himself to me. We landed on a sandy beach before a vast number of people, who had got
together with no other intent than to see us; for many of them had not a stick in their hands;
consequently we were received with great courtesy, and with the surprise natural for people to
express, at seeing men and things so new to them as we must be. I made presents to all those my
friend pointed out, who were either old men, or such as seemed to be of some note; but he took not
the least notice of some women who stood behind the crowd, folding my hand when I was going to give
them some beads and medals. Here we found the same chief, who had been seen in one of the canoes in
the morning. His name, we now learnt, was Teabooma; and we had not been on shore above ten minutes,
before he called for silence. Being instantly obeyed by every individual present, he made a short
speech; and soon after another chief having called for silence, made a speech also. It was pleasing
to see with what attention they were heard. Their speeches were composed of short sentences; to each
of which two or three old men answered, by nodding their heads, and giving a kind of grunt,
significant, as I thought, of approbation. It was impossible for us to know the purport of these
speeches; but we had reason to think they were favourable to us, on whose account they doubtless
were made.</p><p>I kept my eyes fixed on the people all the time, and saw nothing to induce me to think otherwise.
While we were with them, having enquired, by signs, for fresh water, some pointed to the east and
others to the west. My friend undertook to conduct us to it, and embarked with us for that purpose.
We rowed about two miles up the coast to the east, where the shore was mostly covered with
mangrove-trees; and entering amongst them, by a narrow creek or river, which brought us to a little
straggling village, above all the mangroves, there we landed and were shewn fresh water. The ground
near this village was finely cultivated, being laid out in plantations of sugar-canes, plantains,
yams, and other roots, and watered by little rills, conducted by art from the main stream, whose
source was in the hills. Here were some cocoa-nut trees, which did not seem burdened with fruit. We
heard the crowing of cocks, but saw none. Some roots were baking on a fire in an earthen jar, which
would have held six or eight gallons; nor did we doubt its being their own manufacture. As we
proceeded up the creek, Mr Forster having shot a duck flying over our heads, which was the first use
these people saw made of our fire-arms, my friend begged to have it; and when he landed, told his
countrymen in what manner it was killed. The day being far spent, and the tide not permitting us to
stay longer in the creek, we took leave of the people and got on board a little after sun-set. From
this little excursion, I found that we were to expect nothing from these people but the privilege of
visiting their country undisturbed. For it was easy to see they had little else than good-nature to
bestow. In this they exceeded all the nations we had yet met with; and, although it did not satisfy
the demands of nature, it at once pleased and left our minds at ease.</p><p>Next morning we were visited by some hundreds of the natives; some coming in canoes, and others
swimming off; so that, before <time>ten o'clock</time>, our decks, and all other parts of the ship, were quite
full with them. My friend, who was of the number, brought me a few roots, but all the others came
empty in respect to eatables. Some few had with them their arms, such as clubs and darts, which they
exchanged for nails, pieces of cloth, etc. After breakfast, I sent Lieutenant Pickersgill with two
armed boats to look for fresh water; for what we found the day before was by no means convenient for
us to get on board. At the same time Mr Wales, accompanied by lieutenant Clerke, went to the little
isle to make preparations for observing the eclipse of the sun, which was to be in the <time>afternoon</time>. Mr
Pickersgill soon returning, informed me that he had found a stream of fresh water, pretty convenient
to come at. I therefore ordered the launch to be hoisted out to complete our water, and then went to
the isle to assist in the observation.</p><p>About one p.m., the eclipse came on. Clouds interposed, and we lost the first contact, but were
more fortunate in the end, which was observed as follows:</p><p>By Mr Wales with Dollond's 3 1/2 foot achromatic refractor, at 3h 28' 39" 1/4 \ By Mr Clerke with

I am of opinion it answers the purpose of a micrometer to a great degree of certainty, and is a
great addition to the use of this most valuable instrument. After all was over, we returned on
board, where I found Teabooma the chief, who soon after slipped out of the ship without my
knowledge, and by that means lost the present I had made up for him.</p><p>In the evening I went ashore to the watering-place, which was at the head of a little creek, at a
fine stream that came from the hills. It was necessary to have a small boat in the creek to convey
the casks from and to the beach over which they were rolled, and then put into the launch; as only a
small boat could enter the creek, and that only at high water. Excellent wood for fuel was here far
more convenient than water, but this was an article we did not want. About <time>seven o'clock</time> this
evening, died Simon Monk, our butcher, a man much esteemed in the ship; his death being occasioned
by a fall down the fore-hatch-way the preceding night.</p><p>Early in the morning of the 7th, the watering-party, and a guard, under the command of an
officer, were sent ashore; and soon after a party of us went to take a view of the country. As soon
as we landed we made known our design to the natives, and two of them undertaking to be our guides,
conducted us up the hills by a tolerably good path. In our route, we met several people, most or
whom turned back with us; so that at last our train was numerous. Some we met who wanted us to
return; but we paid no regard to their signs, nor did they seem uneasy when we proceeded. At length
we reached the summit of one of the hills, from which we saw the sea in two places, between some
advanced hills, on the opposite or S.W. side of the land. This was an useful discovery, as it
enabled us to judge of the breadth of the land, which, in this part, did not exceed ten leagues.</p><p>Between those advanced hills, and the ridge we were upon, was a large valley, through which ran a
serpentine river. On the banks of this were several plantations, and some villages, whose
inhabitants we had met on the road, and found more on the top of the hill gazing at the ship, as
might be supposed. The plain, or flat of land, which lies along the shore we were upon, appeared
from the hills to great advantage; the winding streams which ran through out, the plantations, the
little straggling villages, the variety in the woods, and the shoals on the coast, so variegating
the scene, that the whole might afford a picture for romance. Indeed, if it were not for those
fertile spots on the plains, and some few on the sides of the mountains, the whole country might be
called a dreary waste. The mountains, and other high places, are, for the most part, incapable of
cultivation, consisting chiefly of rocks, many of which are full of mundicks. The little soil that
is upon them is scorched and burnt up with the sun; it is, nevertheless, coated with coarse grass
and other plants, and here and there trees and shrubs. The country, in general, bore great
resemblance to some parts of New Holland under the same parallel of latitude, several of its natural
productions seeming to be the same, and the woods being without underwood, as in that country. The
reefs on the coast and several other similarities, were obvious to every one who had seen both
countries. We observed all the N.E. coast to be covered with shoals and breakers, extending to the
northward, beyond the Isle of Balabea, till they were lost in the horizon. Having made these
observations, and our guides not chusing to go farther, we descended the mountains by a road
different from that by which we ascended. This brought us down through some of their plantations in
the plains, which I observed were laid out with great judgment, and cultivated with much labour.
Some of them were lying in fallow, some seemingly lately laid down, and others of longer date,
pieces of which they were again beginning to dig up. The first thing I observed they did, was to set
fire to the grass, etc. which had over-run the surface. Recruiting the land by letting it lie some
years untouched, is observed by all the nations in this sea; but they seem to have no notion of
manuring it, at least I have no where seen it done. Our excursion was finished by <time>noon</time>, when we
returned on board to dinner; and one of our guides having left us, we brought the other with us,
whose fidelity was rewarded at a small expence.</p><p>In the <time>afternoon</time> I made a little excursion along-shore to the westward, in company with Mr Wales.
Besides making observations on such things as we met, we got the names of several places, which I
then thought were islands; but upon farther enquiry, I found they were districts upon the same land.
This <time>afternoon</time> a fish being struck by one of the natives near the watering-place, my clerk purchased
it, and sent it to me after my return on board.</p><p>It was of a new species, something like a sun-fish, with a large long ugly head. Having no
suspicion of its being of a poisonous nature, we ordered it to be dressed for supper; but, very
luckily, the operation of drawing and describing took up so much time, that it was too late, so that
only the liver and row were dressed, of which the two Mr Forsters and myself did but taste. About
<time>three o'clock  in the morning</time>, we found ourselves seized with an extraordinary weakness and numbness
all over our limbs. I had almost lost the sense of feeling; nor could I distinguish between light
and heavy bodies, of such as I had strength to move; a quart-pot, full of water, and a feather,
being the same in my hand. We each of us took an emetic, and after that a sweat, which gave us much
relief. In the morning, one of the pigs, which had eaten the entrails, was found dead. When the
natives came on board and saw the fish hanging up, they immediately gave us to understand it was not
wholesome food, and expressed the utmost abhorrence of it; though no one was observed to do this
when the fish was to be sold, or even after it was purchased.</p><p>On the 8th, the guard and a party of men were on shore as usual. In the <time>afternoon</time>, I received a
message from the officer, acquainting me that Teabooma the chief was come with a present consisting
of a few yams and sugar-canes. In return, I sent him, amongst other articles, a dog and a bitch,
both young, but nearly full grown. The dog was red and white, but the bitch was all red, or the
colour of an English fox. I mention this, because they may prove the Adam and Eve of their species
in that country. When the officer returned on board in the evening, he informed me that the chief
came, attended by about twenty men, so that it looked like a visit of ceremony. It was some time
before he would believe the dog and bitch were intended for him; but as soon as he was convinced, he
seemed lost in an excess of joy, and sent them away immediately.</p><p>Next morning early, I dispatched Lieutenant Pickersgill and Mr Gilbert with the launch and cutter
to explore the coast to the west; judging this would be better effected in the boats than in the
ship, as the reef would force the latter several leagues from land. After breakfast, a party of men
was sent on shore, to make brooms; but myself and the two Mr Forsters were confined on board, though
much better, a good sweat having had an happy effect. In the <time>afternoon</time> a man was seen, both ashore
and alongside the ship, said to be as white as an European. From the account I had of him (for I did
not see him,) his whiteness did not proceed from hereditary descent, but from chance or some
disease; and such have been seen at Otaheite and the Society Isles. A fresh easterly wind, and the
ship lying a mile from the shore, did not hinder those good-natured people from swimming off to us
in shoals of twenty or thirty, and returning the same way.</p><p>[* Wafers met with Indians in the Isthmus of Darien of the colour of a white horse. See his
'Description of the Isthmus', page 134. See also Mr de Paw's Philosophical Enquiries concerning
Americans, where several other instances of this remarkable whiteness are mentioned, and the causes
of it attempted to be explained.]</p><p>On the 10th, a party was on shore as usual; and Mr Forster so well recovered as to go out
botanizing.</p><p>In the evening of the 11th, the boats returned, when I was informed of the following
circumstances. From an elevation which they reached the morning they set out, they had a view of the
coast. Mr Gilbert was of opinion that they saw the termination of it to the west, but Mr Pickersgill
thought not; though both agreed that there was no passage for the ship that way. From this place,
accompanied by two of the natives, they went to Balabea, which they did not reach till after
sun-set, and left again next morning before sun-rise; consequently this was a fruitless expedition,
and the two following days were spent in getting up to the ship. As they went down to the isle, they
saw abundance of turtle; but the violence of the wind and sea made it impossible to strike any. The
cutter was near being lost, by suddenly filling with water, which obliged them to throw several
things overboard, before they could free her, and stop the leak she had sprung. From a fishing
canoe, which they met coming in from the reefs, they got as much fish as they could eat; and they
were received by Teabi, the chief of the isle of Balabea, and the people, who came in numbers to see
them, with great courtesy. In order not to be too much crowded, our people drew a line on the
ground, and gave the others to understand they were not to come within it. This restriction they
observed, and one of them, soon after, turned to his own advantage. For happening to have a few
cocoa-nuts, which one of our people wanted to buy, and he was unwilling to part with, he walked off,
and was followed by the man who wanted them. On seeing this, he sat down on the sand, made a circle
round him, as he had seen our people do, and signified that the other was not to come within it;
which was accordingly observed. As this story was well attested, I thought it not unworthy of a
place in this journal.</p><p>Early in the morning of the 12th, I ordered the carpenter to work, to repair the cutter, and the
water to be re-placed, which we had expended the three preceding days. As Tea Booma the chief had
not been seen since he got the dogs, and I wanted to lay a foundation for stocking the country with
hogs also, I took a young boar and a sow with me in the boat, and went up to the mangrove creek to
look for my friend, in order to give them to him.</p><p>But when we arrived there, we were told that he lived at some distance, and that they would send
for him. Whether they did or no I cannot say; but he not coming, I resolved to give them to the
first man of note I met with. The guide we had to the hills happening to be there, I made him
understand that I intended to leave the two pigs on shore, and ordered them out of the boat for that
purpose. I offered them to a grave old man, thinking he was a proper person to entrust them with;
but he shook his head, and he and all present, made signs to take them into the boat again. When
they saw I did not comply, they seemed to consult with one another what was to be done; and then our
guide told me to carry them to the Alekee (chief). Accordingly I ordered them to be taken up, and we
were conducted by him to a house, wherein were seated, in a circle, eight or ten middle-aged
persons. To them I and my pigs being introduced, with great courtesy they desired me to sit down;
and then I began to expatiate on the merits of the two pigs, explaining to them how many young ones
the female would have at one time, and how soon these would multiply to some hundreds. My only
motive was to enhance their value, that they might take the more care of them; and I had reason to
think I in some measure succeeded. In the mean time, two men having left the company, soon returned
with six yams, which were presented to me; and then I took my leave and went on board.</p><p>I have already observed, that here was a little village; I now found it much larger than I
expected; and about it, a good deal of cultivated land, regularly laid out, planted and planting
with taro or eddy root, yams, sugar-canes, and plantains. The taro plantations were prettily watered
by little rills, continually supplied from the main channel at the foot of the mountains, from
whence these streams were conducted in artful meanders. They have two methods of planting these
roots, some are in square or oblong patches, which lie perfectly horizontal, and sink below the
common level of the adjacent land, so that they can let in on them as much water as they think
necessary. I have generally seen them covered two or three inches deep; but I do not know that this
is always necessary. Others are planted in ridges about three or four feet broad, and two, or two
and a half high. On the middle or top of the ridge, is a narrow gutter, in and along which is
conveyed, as above described, a little rill that waters the roots, planted in the ridge on each side
of it; and these plantations are so judiciously laid out, that the same stream waters several
ridges. These ridges are sometimes the divisions to the horizontal plantations; and when this method
is used, which is for the most part observed where a pathway, or something of that sort, is
requisite, not an inch of ground is lost. Perhaps there may be some difference in the roots, which
may make these two methods of raising them necessary. Some are better tasted than others, and they
are not all of a colour; but be this as it may, they are very wholesome food, and the tops make good
greens, and are eaten as such by the natives. On these plantations men, women, and children were
employed.</p><p>In the <time>afternoon</time> I went on shore, and, on a large tree, which stood close to the shore, near the
watering-place, had an inscription cut, setting forth the ship's name, date, etc. as a testimony of
our being the first discoverers of this country, as I had done at all others, at which we had
touched, where this ceremony was necessary. This being done, we took leave of our friends, and
returned on board; when I ordered all the boats to be hoisted in, in order to be ready to put to sea
in the morning.</p></div><div type="chapter"><head><l>CHAPTER IX.</l><l><emph>A Description of the Country and its Inhabitants; their Manners, Customs, and
Arts.</emph></l></head><p><date>1774 September</date></p><p>I shall conclude our transactions at this place with some account of the country and its
inhabitants. They are a strong, robust, active, well-made people, courteous and friendly, and not in
the least addicted to pilfering, which is more than can be said of any other nation in this sea.
They are nearly of the same colour as the natives of Tanna, but have better features, more agreeable
countenances, and are a much stouter race; a few being seen who measured six feet four inches. I
observed some who had thick lips, flat noses, and full cheeks, and, in some degree, the features and
look of a negro. Two things contributed to the forming of such an idea; first, their rough mop
heads, and, secondly, their besmearing their faces with black pigment. Their hair and beards are, in
general, black. The former is very much frizzled, so that, at first sight, it appears like that of a
negro. It is, nevertheless, very different, though both coarser and stronger than ours. Some, who
wear it long, tie it up on the crown of the head; others suffer only a large lock to grow on each
side, which they tie up in clubs; many others, as well as all the women, wear it cropped short.
These rough heads, most probably, want frequent scratching; for which purpose they have a most
excellent instrument. This is a kind of comb made of sticks of hard wood, from seven to nine or ten
inches long, and about the thickness of knitting-needles. A number of these, seldom exceeding
twenty, but generally fewer, is fastened together at one end, parallel to, and near one-tenth of an
inch from each other. The other ends, which are a little pointed, will spread out or open like the
sticks of a fan, by which means they can beat up the quarters of an hundred lice at a time. These
combs or scratchers, for I believe they serve both purposes, they always wear in their hair, on one
side their head. The people of Tanna have an instrument of this kind for the same use; but theirs is
forked, I think, never exceeding three or four prongs; and sometimes only a small pointed stick.
Their beards, which are of the same crisp nature as their hair, are, for the most part, worn short.
Swelled and ulcerated legs and feet are common among the men; as also a swelling of the scrotum. I
know not whether this is occasioned by disease, or by the mode of applying the wrapper
before-mentioned, and which they use as at Tanna and Mallicollo. This is their only covering, and is
made generally of the bark of a tree, but sometimes of leaves. The small pieces of cloth, paper,
etc. which they got from us, were commonly applied to this use. We saw coarse garments amongst them,
made of a sort of matting, but they seemed never to wear them, except when out in their canoes and
unemployed. Some had a kind of concave, cylindrical, stiff black cap, which appeared to be a great
ornament among them, and, we thought, was only worn by men of note or warriors. A large sheet of
strong paper, when they got one from us, was generally applied to this use.</p><p>The women's dress is a short petticoat, made of the filaments of the plantain-tree, laid over a
cord, to which they are fastened, and tied round the waist. The petticoat is made at least six or
eight inches thick, but not one inch longer than necessary for the use designed. The outer filaments
are dyed black; and, as an additional ornament, the most of them have a few pearl oyster-shells
fixed on the right side. The general ornaments of both sexes are ear-rings of tortoise-shell,
necklaces or amulets, made both of shells and stones, and bracelets, made of large shells, which
they wear above the elbow. They have punctures, or marks on the skin, on several parts of the body;
but none, I think, are black, as at the Eastern Islands. I know not if they have any other design
than ornament; and the people of Tanna are marked much in the same manner.</p><p>Were I to judge of the origin of this nation, I should take them to be a race between the people
of Tanna and of the Friendly Isles, or between those of Tanna and the New Zealanders, or all three;
their language, in some respects, being a mixture of them all. In their disposition they are like
the natives of the Friendly Isles; but in affability and honesty they excel them.</p><p>Notwithstanding their pacific inclination they must sometimes have wars, as they are well
provided with offensive weapons, such as clubs, spears, darts, and slings for throwing stones. The
clubs are about two feet and a half long, and variously formed; some like a scythe, others like a
pick-axe; some have a head like an hawk, and others have round heads, but all are neatly made. Many
of their darts and spears are no less neat, and ornamented with carvings. The slings are as simple
as possible; but they take some pains to form the stones that they use into a proper shape, which is
something like an egg, supposing both ends to be like the small one. They use a becket, in the same
manner as at Tanna, in throwing the dart, which, I believe, is much used in striking fish, etc. In
this they seem very dexterous; nor, indeed, do I know that they have any other method of catching
large fish, for I neither saw hooks nor lines among them.</p><p>It is needless to mention their working-tools, as they are made of the same materials, and nearly
in the same manner, as at the other islands. Their axes, indeed, are a little different; some, at
least, which may be owing to fancy as much as custom.</p><p>Their houses, or at least most of them, are circular, something like a bee-hive, and full as
close and warm. The entrance is by a small door, or long square hole, just big enough to admit a man
bent double. The side-walls are about four feet and a half high, but the roof is lofty, and peaked
to a point at the top; above which is a post, or stick of wood, which is generally ornamented either
with carving or shells, or both. The framing is of small spars, reeds, etc. and both sides and roof
are thick and close covered with thatch, made of coarse long grass. In the inside of the house are
set up posts, to which cross spars are fastened, and platforms made, for the conveniency of laying
any thing on. Some houses have two floors, one above the other. The floor is laid with dry grass,
and here and there mats are spread, for the principal people to sleep or sit on. In most of them we
found two fire-places, and commonly a fire burning; and, as there was no vent for the smoke but by
the door, the whole house was both smoky and hot, insomuch that we, who were not used to such an
atmosphere, could hardly endure it a moment. This may be the reason why we found these people so
chilly when in the open air, and without exercise. We frequently saw them make little fires any
where, and hustle round them, with no other view than to warm themselves. Smoke within doors may be
a necessary evil, as it prevents the musquitoes from coming in, which are pretty numerous here. In
some respects their habitations are neat; for, besides the ornaments at top, I saw some with carved
door-posts. Upon the whole, their houses are better calculated for a cold than a hot climate; and as
there are no partitions in them, they can have little privacy.</p><p>They have no great variety of household utensils; the earthen jars before mentioned being the
only article worth notice. Each family has at least one of them, in which they bake their roots, and
perhaps their fish, etc. The fire, by which they cook their victuals, is on the outside of each
house, in the open air. There are three or five pointed stones fixed in the ground, their pointed
ends being about six inches above the surface. Those of three stones are only for one jar, those of
five stones for two. The jars do not stand on their bottoms, but lie inclined on their sides. The
use of these stones is obviously to keep the jars from resting on the fire, in order that it may
burn the better.</p><p>They subsist chiefly on roots and fish, and the bark of a tree, which I am told grows also in the
West Indies. This they roast, and are almost continually chewing. It has a sweetish, insipid taste,
and was liked by some of our people. Water is their only liquor, at least I never saw any other made
use of.</p><p>Plantains and sugar-canes are by no means in plenty. Bread-fruit is very scarce, and the
cocoa-nut trees are small and but thinly planted; and neither one nor the other seems to yield much
fruit.</p><p>To judge merely by the numbers of the natives we saw every day, one might think the island very
populous; but I believe that, at this time, the inhabitants were collected from all parts on our
account. Mr Pickersgill observed, that down the coast, to the west, there were but few people; and
we knew they came daily from the other side of the land, over the mountains, to visit us. But
although the inhabitants, upon the whole, may not be numerous, the island is not thinly peopled on
the sea-coast, and in the plains and valleys that are capable of cultivation. It seems to be a
country unable to support many inhabitants. Nature has been less bountiful to it than to any other
tropical island we know in this sea. The greatest part of its surface, or at least what we saw of
it, consists of barren rocky mountains; and the grass, etc. growing on them, is useless to people
who have no cattle.</p><p>The sterility of the country will apologise for the natives not contributing to the wants of the
navigator. The sea may, perhaps, in some measure, compensate for the deficiency of the land; for a
coast surrounded by reefs and shoals, as this is, cannot fail of being stored with fish.</p><p>I have before observed, that the country bears great resemblance to New South Wales, or New
Holland, and that some of its natural productions are the same. In particular, we found here, the
tree which is covered with a soft white ragged bark, easily peeled off, and is, as I have been told,
the same that, in the East Indies, is used for caulking of ships. The wood is very hard, the leaves
are long and narrow, of a pale dead green, and a fine aromatic; so that it may properly be said to
belong to that continent. Nevertheless, here are several plants, etc. common to the eastern and
northern islands, and even a species of the passionflower, which, I am told, has never before been
known to grow wild any where but in America. Our botanists did not complain for want of employment
at this place; every day bringing something new in botany or other branches of natural history.
Land-birds, indeed, are not numerous, but several are new. One of these is a kind of crow, at least
so we called it, though it is not half so big, and its feathers are tinged with blue. They also have
some very beautiful turtle-doves, and other small birds, such as I never saw before.</p><p>All our endeavours to get the name of the whole island proved ineffectual. Probably it is too
large for them to know by one name. Whenever we made this enquiry, they always gave us the name of
some district or place, which we pointed to; and, as before observed, I got the names of several,
with the name of the king or chief of each. Hence I conclude, that the country is divided into
several districts, each governed by a chief; but we know nothing of the extent of his power. Balade
was the name of the district we were at, and Tea Booma the chief. He lived on the other side of the
ridge of hills, so that we had but little of his company, and therefore could not see much of his
power. <emph>Tea</emph> seems a title prefixed to the names of all, or most, of their chiefs or
great men. My friend honoured me by calling me <emph>Tea</emph> Cook.</p><p>They deposit their dead in the ground. I saw none of their burying-places, but several of the
gentlemen did. In one, they were informed, lay the remains of a chief who was slain in battle; and
his grave, which bore some resemblance to a large mole-hill, was decorated with spears, darts,
paddles, etc. all stuck upright in the ground round about it. The canoes, which these people use,
are somewhat like those of the Friendly Isles; but the most heavy clumsy vessels I ever saw. They
are what I call double canoes, made out of two large trees, hollowed out, having a raised gunnel,
about two inches high, and closed at each end with a kind of bulk-head of the same height; so that
the whole is like a long square trough, about three feet shorter than the body of the canoe; that
is, a foot and a half at each end. Two canoes, thus fitted, are secured to each other, about three
feet asunder, by means of cross spars, which project about a foot over each side. Over these spars
is laid a deck, or very heavy platform, made of plank, and small round spars, on which they have a
fire-hearth, and generally a fire burning; and they carry a pot or jar to dress their victuals in.
The space between the two canoes is laid with plank, and the rest with spars. On one side of the
deck, and close to the edge, is fixed a row of knees, pretty near to each other, the use of which is
to keep the masts, yards, etc. from, rolling over-board. They are navigated by one or two
lateen-sails, extended to a small lateen-yard, the end of which fixes in a notch or hole in the
deck. The foot of the sail is extended to a small boom. The sail is composed of pieces of matting,
the ropes are made of the coarse filaments of the plantain-tree, twisted into cords of the thickness
of a finger; and three or four more such cords, marled together, serve them for shrouds, etc. I
thought they sailed very well; but they are not at all calculated for rowing or paddling. Their
method of proceeding, when they cannot sail, is by sculling, and for this purpose there are holes in
the boarded deck or platform. Through these they put the sculls, which are of such a length, that,
when the blade is in the water, the loom or handle is four or five feet above the deck. The man who
works it stands behind, and with both his hands sculls the vessel forward. This method of proceeding
is very slow; and for this reason, the canoes are but ill calculated for fishing, especially for
striking of turtle, which, I think, can hardly ever be done in them. Their fishing implements, such
as I have seen, are turtle-nets, made, I believe, of the filaments of the plantain-tree twisted; and
small hand-nets, with very minute meshes made of fine twine and fish-gigs. Their general method of
fishing, I guess, is to lie on the reefs in shoal water, and to strike the fish that may come in
their way. They may, however, have other methods, which we had no opportunity to see, as no boat
went out while we were here; all their time and attention being taken up with us. Their canoes are
about thirty feet long, and the deck or platform about twenty-four in length, and ten in breadth. We
had not, at this time, seen any timber in the country so large as that of which their canoes were
made. It was observed that the holes, made in the several parts, in order to sew them together, were
burnt through, but with what instrument we never learnt. Most probably it was of stone, which may be
the reason why they were so fond of large spikes, seeing at once they would answer this purpose. I
was convinced they were not wholly designed for edge-tools, because every one shewed a desire for
the iron belaying-pins which were fixed in the quarter-deck rail, and seemed to value them far more
than a spike-nail, although it might be twice as big. These pins, which are round, perhaps have the
very shape of the tool they wanted to make of the nails. I did not find that a hatchet was quite so
valuable as a large spike. Small nails were of little or no value; and beads, looking-glasses, etc.
they did not admire.</p><p>The women of this country, and likewise those of Tanna, are, so far as I could judge, far more
chaste than those of the more eastern islands. I never heard that one of our people obtained the
least favour from any one of them. I have been told that the ladies here would frequently divert
themselves by going a little aside with our gentlemen, as if they meant to be kind to them, and then
would run away laughing at them. Whether this was chastity or coquetry, I shall not pretend to
determine; nor is it material, since the consequences were the same.</p></div><div type="chapter"><head><l>CHAPTER X.</l><l><emph>Proceedings on the Coast of New Caledonia, with Geographical and Nautical
Observations.</emph></l></head><p><date>1774 September</date></p><p>Everything being in readiness to put to sea, at sun-rise, on the 13th of September, we weighed,
and with a fine gale at E. by S., stood out for the same channel we came in by. At half past seven
we were in the middle of it. Observatory Isle bore S. 5° E., distant four miles, and the isle of
Balabea W.N.W. As soon as we were clear of the reef, we hauled the wind to the starboard tack, with
a view of plying in to the S.E.; but as Mr Gilbert was of opinion that he had seen the end, or N.W.
extremity of the land, and that it would be easier to get round by the N.W., I gave over plying, and
bore up along the outside of the reef, steering N.N.W., N.W., and N.W. by W., as it trended. At <time>noon</time>
the island of Balabea bore S. by W., distant thirteen miles; and what we judged to be the west end
of the great land, bore S.W. 1/2 S., and the direction of the reef was N.W. by W., latitude observed
19° 53' 20". Longitude from Observatory Isle 14' W. We continued to steer N.W. by W. along the
outside of the reef till <time>three o'clock</time>, at which time the isle of Balabea bore S. by E. 1/2 E. In
this direction we observed a partition in the reef, which we judged to be a channel, by the strong
tide which set out of it. From this place the reef inclined to the north for three or four leagues,
and then to the N.W. We followed its direction, and as we advanced to N.W., raised more land, which
seemed to be connected with what we had seen before; so that Mr Gilbert was mistaken, and did not
see the extremity of the coast. At <time>five o'clock</time> this land bore W. by N. 1/2 N., distant twenty
miles; but what we could see of the reef trended in the direction of N.W. by N.</p><p>Having hauled the wind to the starboard tack, and spent the night plying, on the 14th, at
sun-rise, the island of Balabea bore S. 6 E., and the land seen the preceding night W., but the reef
still trended N.W., along which we steered with a light breeze at E.S.E. At <time>noon</time> we observed in
latitude <geo select="lat">19° 28' S</geo>, <geo select="lon">longitude from Observatory Isle 27' W</geo><!--EB-B: GEOCODE NOTE: I'm grabbing some text here
since this is a relative longitude reading.-->. We had now no sight of Balabea; and the
other land, that is, the N.W. part of it, bore W. by S. 1/2 S., but we were not sure if this was one
continued coast, or separate islands. For though some partitions were seen, from space to space,
which made it look like the latter, a multitude of shoals rendered a nearer approach to it
exceedingly dangerous, if not impracticable. In the <time>afternoon</time>, with a fine breeze at E.S.E., we
ranged the outside of these shoals, which we found to trend in the direction of N.W. by W., N.W. by
N., and N.N.E. At <time>three o'clock</time> we passed a low sandy isle, lying on the outer edge of the reef, in
latitude <geo select="lat">19° 25' S</geo>, and in the direction of N.E. from the north-westernmost land, six or seven leagues
distant. So much as we could see of this space was strewed with shoals, seemingly detached from each
other; and the channel leading in amongst them appeared to be on the S.E. side of the sandy isle; at
least, there was a space where the sea did not break. At sun-set we could but just see the land,
which bore S.W. by S., about ten leagues distant. A clear horizon produced the discovery of no land
to the westward of this direction; the reef too trended away W. by N. 1/2 N., and seemed to
terminate in a point which was seen from the mast-head. Thus every thing conspired to make us
believe that we should soon get round these shoals; and with these flattering expectations we hauled
the wind, which was at E.N.E., and spent the night making short boards.</p><p>Next morning at sun-rise, seeing neither land nor breakers, we bore away N.W. by W., and two
hours after saw the reef extending N.W. farther than the eye could reach; no land was to be seen. It
was therefore probable that we had passed its N.W. extremity; and, as we had seen from the hills of
Balade its extent to the S.W., it was necessary to know how far it extended to the east or
southeast, while it was in our power to recover the coast; for, by following the direction of the
shoals, we might have been carried so far to leeward as not to be able to beat back without
considerable loss of time. We were already far out of sight of land; and there was no knowing how
much farther we might be carried, before we found an end to them. These considerations, together
with the risk we must run in exploring a sea strewed with shoals, and where no anchorage, without
them, is to be found, induced me to abandon the design of proceeding round by the N.W., and to ply
up to the S.E., in which direction I knew there was a clear sea. With this view we tacked and stood
to the S.E., with the wind at N.E. by E., a gentle breeze. At this time we were in the latitude of
<geo select="lat">19° 7' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">163° 57' E</geo>.</p><p>In standing to the S.E. we did but just weather the point of the reef we had passed the preceding
evening. To make our situation the more dangerous the wind began to fail us; and at three in the
<time>afternoon</time> it fell calm, and left us to the mercy of a great swell, setting directly on the reef,
which was hardly a league from us. We sounded, but found no bottom with a line of two hundred
fathoms. I ordered the pinnace and cutter to be hoisted out to tow the ship, but they were of little
use against so great a swell. We, however, found that the ship did not draw near the reef so fast as
might be expected; and at <time>seven o'clock</time> a light air at N.N.E. kept her head to the sea, but it
lasted no longer than midnight, when it was succeeded by a dead calm.</p><p>At day-break on the 16th we had no sight of the reef; and at eleven, a breeze springing up at
S.S.W., we hoisted in the boats, and made sail to S.E. At <time>noon</time> we observed in <geo select="lat">19° 35' S</geo>., which was
considerably more to the south than we expected, and shewed that a current or tide had been in our
favour all night, and accounted for our getting so unexpectedly clear of the shoals. At <time>two o'clock</time>
p.m. we had again a calm which lasted till nine, when it was succeeded by a light air from E.N.E.
and E., with which we advanced but slowly.</p><p>On the 17th at <time>noon</time>, we observed in latitude <geo select="lat">19° 54' S</geo>, when the isle of Balabea bore <geo>S. 68° W.</geo>,
ten and a half leagues distant. We continued to ply, with variable light winds, between N.E. and
S.E., without meeting with any thing remarkable till the 20th at <time>noon</time>, when Cape Colnett bore <geo>N. 78°
W.</geo>, distant six leagues. From this cape the land extended round by the south to E.S.E. till it was
lost in the horizon, and the country appeared with many hills and vallies. Latitude observed <geo select="lat">20°
41' S</geo>, <geo select="lon">longitude made from Observatory Isle 1° 8' E</geo>. We stood in shore with a light breeze at east
till sun-set, when we were between two and three leagues off. The coast extended from <geo>S. 42.5° E.</geo>
to <geo>N. 59° W</geo>. Two small islets lay without this last direction, distant from us four or five miles;
some others lay between us and the shore, and to the east, where they seemed to be connected by
reefs, in which appeared some openings from space to space. The country was mountainous, and had
much the same aspect as about Balade. On one of the western small isles was an elevation like a
tower; and over a low neck of land within the isle were seen many other elevations, resembling the
masts of a fleet of ships.</p><p>Next day at sun-rise, after having stood off all night with a light breeze at S.E., we found
ourselves about six leagues from the coast; and in this situation we were kept by a calm till ten in
the evening, when we got a faint land-breeze at S.W., with which we steered S.E. all night.,</p><p>On the 22d at sun-rise the land was clouded, but it was not long before the clouds went off, and
we found, by our land-marks, that we had made a good advance. At <time>ten o'clock</time>, the land-breeze being
succeeded by a sea-breeze at E. by S., this enabled us to stand in for the land, which at <time>noon</time>
extended from N. 78° W. to S. 31.5° E., round by the S. In this last direction the coast seemed to
trend more to the south in a lofty promontory, which, on account of the day, received the name of
Cape Coronation. Latitude <geo select="lat">22° 2' S</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon">167° 7' 1/2 E</geo>. Some breakers lay between us and the
shore, and probably they were connected with those we had seen before.</p><p>During the night, we had advanced about two leagues to the S.E.; and at day-break on the 23d an
elevated point appeared in sight beyond Cape Coronation, bearing S. 23° E. It proved to be the
south-east extremity of the coast, and obtained the name of Queen Charlotte's Foreland. Latitude <geo select="lat">22°
16' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">167° 14' E</geo>. About <time>noon</time>, having got a breeze from the N.E., we stood to S.S.E., and
as we drew towards Cape Coronation, saw in a valley to the south of it, a vast number of those
elevated objects before-mentioned; and some low land under the foreland was wholly covered with
them. We could not agree in our opinions of what they were. I supposed them to be a singular sort of
trees, being too numerous to resemble any thing else; and a great deal of smoke kept rising all the
day from amongst those near the cape. Our philosophers were of opinion that this was the smoke of
some internal and perpetual fire. My representing to them that there was no smoke here in the
morning would have been of no avail, had not this eternal fire gone out before night, and no more
smoke been seen after. They were still more positive that the elevations were pillars of basaltes,
like those which compose the Giant's Causeway in Ireland. At sun-set, the wind veering round to the
south, we tacked and stood off, it not being safe to approach the shore in the dark. At day-break we
stood in again, with a faint land-breeze between E.S.E. and S.S.E. At <time>noon</time> observed, in latitude <geo select="lat">21°
59' 30" S</geo>, Cape Coronation being west southerly, distant seven leagues, and the foreland S. 38° W. As
we advanced S.S.W. the coast beyond the foreland began to appear in sight; and at sun-set we
discovered a low island lying S.S.E, about seven miles from the foreland. It was one of those which
are generally surrounded with shoals and breakers. At the same time a round hill was seen bearing S.
24° E, twelve leagues distant. During night, having had variable light winds, we advanced but little
either way.</p><p>On the 25th, about <time>ten o'clock</time> a.m., having got a fair breeze at E.S.E., we stood to the S.S.W.,
in hopes of getting round the foreland; but, as we drew near, we perceived more low isles, beyond
the one already mentioned, which at last appeared to be connected by breakers, extending towards the
foreland, and seeming to join the shore. We stood on till half past <time>three o'clock</time>, when we saw, from
the deck, rocks, just peeping above the surface of the sea, on the shoal above-mentioned. It was now
time to alter the course, as the day was too far spent to look for a passage near the shore, and we
could find no bottom to anchor in during the night. We therefore stood to the south to look for a
passage without the small isles. We had a fine breeze at E.S.E., but it lasted no longer than five
o'clock, when it fell to a dead calm. Having sounded, a line of 170 fathoms did not reach the
bottom, though we were but a little way from the shoals, which, instead of following the coast to
S.W., took a S.E. direction towards the hill we had seen the preceding evening, and seemed to point
out to us that it was necessary to go round that land. At this time the most advanced point on the
main bore S. 68° W., distant nine or ten leagues. About <time>seven o'clock</time> we got a light breeze at
north, which enabled us to steer out E.S.E., and to spend the night with less anxiety. On some of
the low isles were many of those elevations already mentioned. Every one was now satisfied they were
trees, except our philosophers, who still maintained that they were basaltes.</p><p>About day-break on the 26th, the wind having shifted to S.S.W., we stretched to S.E. for the hill
before mentioned. It belonged to an island which at <time>noon</time> extended from S. 16° E. to S. 7° W.,
distant six leagues. Latitude observed <geo select="lat">22° 16' S</geo>. In the p.m. the wind freshened, and veering to
S.S.E., we stretched to the east, till two a.m., on the 27th, when we tacked and stood to S.W., with
hopes of weathering the island; but we fell about two miles short of our expectations, and had to
tack about a mile from the east side of the island, the extremes bearing from N.W. by N. to S.W.,
the hill W., and some low isles, lying off the S.E. point, S. by W. These seemed to be connected
with the large island by breakers. We sounded when in stays, but had no ground with a line of eighty
fathoms. The skirts of this island were covered with the elevations more than once mentioned. They
had much the appearance of tall pines, which occasioned my giving that name to the island. The round
hill, which is on the S.W. side, is of such a height as to be seen fourteen or sixteen leagues. The
island is about a mile in circuit, and situated in latitude <geo select="lat" n="1">22° 38' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">167° 40' E</geo>. Having
made two attempts to weather the Isle of Pines before sun-set, with no better success, than before,
this determined me to stretch off till midnight. This day at <time>noon</time> the thermometer was at 68° 3/4
which is lower than it had been since the 27th of February.</p><p>Having tacked at midnight, assisted by the currents and a fresh gale at E. S.E. and S.E., next
morning at day-break we found ourselves several leagues to windward of the Isle of Pines, and bore
away large, round the S.E. and S. sides. The coast from the S.E., round by the S. to the W., was
strewed with sand-banks, breakers, and small low isles, most of which were covered with the same
lofty trees that ornamented the borders of the greater one. We continued to range the outside of
these small isles and breakers, at three-fourths of a league distance, and as we passed one, raised
another, so that they seemed to form a chain extending to the isles which lie off the foreland. At
<time>noon</time> we observed, in latitude <geo select="lat">22° 44' 36" S</geo>. the Isle of Pines extending from N by E 1/2 E. to E. by
N.; and Cape Coronation N. 32° 30' W distant seventeen leagues. In the <time>afternoon</time>, with a fine gale
at east, we steered N.W. by W., along the outside of the shoals, with a view of falling in with the
land a little to S.W. of the foreland. At <time>two o'clock</time> p.m. two low islets were seen bearing W. by
S., and as they were connected by breakers, which seemed to join those on our starboard, this
discovery made it necessary to haul off S.W., in order to get clear of them all. At three, more
breakers appeared, extending from the low isles towards the S.E. We now hauled out close to the
wind, and, in an hour and a half, were almost on board the breakers, and obliged to tack. From the
mast-head they were seen to extend as far as E.S.E., and the smoothness of the sea made it probable
that they extended to the north of east, and that we were in a manner surrounded by them. At this
time the hill on the Isle of Pines bore N. 71 1/2 E., the foreland N. 1/4 W., and the most advanced
point of land on the S.W. coast bore N.W., distant fifteen or sixteen leagues. This direction of the
S.W. coast, which was rather within the parallel of the N.E., assured us that this land extended no
farther to the S.W. After making a short trip to N.N.E., we stood again to the south, in expectation
of having a better view of the shoals before sun-set. We gained nothing by this but the prospect of
a sea strewed with shoals, which we could not clear but by returning in the track by which we came.
We tacked nearly in the same place where we had tacked before, and on sounding found a bottom of
fine sand. But anchoring in a strong gale, with a chain of breakers to leeward, being the last
resource, I rather chose to spend the night in making short boards over that space we had, in some
measure, made ourselves acquainted with in the day: And thus it was spent, but under the terrible
apprehension, every moment, of falling on some of the many dangers which surrounded us.</p><p>Day-light shewed that our fears were not ill-founded, and that we had been in the most imminent
danger; having had breakers continually under our lee, and at a very little distance from us. We
owed our safety to the interposition of Providence, a good look-out, and the very brisk manner in
which the ship was managed; for, as we were standing to the north, the people on the lee-gangway and
forecastle saw breakers under the lee-bow, which we escaped by quickly tacking the ship.</p><p>I was now almost tired of a coast which I could no longer explore, but at the risk of losing the
ship, and ruining the whole voyage. I was, however, determined not to leave it, till I knew what
trees those were which had been the subject of our speculation; especially as they appeared to be of
a sort useful to shipping, and had not been seen any where but in the southern part of this land.
With this view, after making a trip to the south, to weather the shoals under our lee, we stood to
the north, in hopes of finding anchorage under some of the islets on which these trees grow. We were
stopped by <time>eight o'clock</time> by the shoals which lie extended between the Isle of Pines and Queen
Charlotte's Foreland; and found soundings off them in fifty-five, forty, and thirty-six fathoms, a
fine sandy bottom. The nearer we came to these shoals, the more we saw of them, and we were not able
to say if there was any passage between the two lands.</p><p>Being now but a few miles to windward of the low isles lying off the Foreland, mentioned on the
25th and 26th, I bore down to the one next to us. As we drew near it, I perceived that it was
unconnected with the neighbouring shoals, and that it is probable we might get to an anchor under
its lee or west side. We therefore stood on, being conducted by an officer at the mast-head; and
after hauling round the point of the reef which surrounds the isle, we attempted to ply to windward,
in order to get nearer the shore. Another reef to the north confined us to a narrow channel, through
which ran a current against us, that rendered this attempt fruitless; so that we were obliged to
anchor in thirty-nine fathoms water, the bottom fine coral sand; the isle bearing W. by N. one mile
distant. As soon as this was done, we hoisted out a boat, in which I went on ashore, accompanied by
the botanists. We found the tall trees to be a kind of spruce pine, very proper for spars, of which
we were in want. After making this discovery, I hastened on board in order to have more time after
dinner, when I landed again with two boats, accompanied by several of the officers and gentlemen,
having with us the carpenter and some of his crew, to cut down such trees as were wanting. While
this was doing I took the bearings of several lands round. The hill on the Isle of Pines bore S. 59
30' E; the low point of Queen Charlotte's Foreland N. 14° 30' W.; the high land over it, seen over
two low isles, N. 20° W.; and the most advanced point of land to the west, bore west, half a point
south, distant six or seven leagues. We had, from several bearings, ascertained the true direction
of the coast from the foreland to this point, which I shall distinguish by the name of Prince of
Wales's Foreland. It is situated in the latitude of <geo select="lat">22° 29' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">166° 57' E</geo>., is of
considerable height, and, when it first appears above the horizon, looks like an island. From this
cape, the coast trended nearly N.W. This was rather too northerly a direction to join that part
which we saw from the hills of Balade. But as it was very high land which opened off the cape in
that direction, it is very probable that lower land, which we could not see, opened sooner; or else
the coast more to the N.W. takes a more westerly direction, in the same manner as the N.E. coast. Be
this as it may, we pretty well know the extent of the land, by having it confined within certain
limits. However, I still entertained hopes of seeing more of it, but was disappointed.</p><p>The little isle upon which we landed, is a mere sandbank, not exceeding three-fourths of a mile
in circuit, and on it, besides these pines, grew the Etoa-tree of Otaheite, and a variety of other
trees, shrubs, and plants. These gave sufficient employment to our botanists, all the time we stayed
upon it, and occasioned my calling it Botany Isle. On it were several water-snakes, some pigeons,
and doves, seemingly different from any we had seen. One of the officers shot a hawk, which proved
to be of the very same sort as our English fishing-hawks. Several fire-places, branches, and leaves
very little decayed, remains of turtle, etc. shewed that people had lately been on the isle. The
hull of a canoe, precisely of the same shape as those we had seen at Balade, lay wrecked in the
sand. We were now no longer at a loss to know of what trees they make their canoes, as they can be
no other than these pines. On this little isle were some which measured twenty inches diameter, and
between sixty and seventy feet in length, and would have done very well for a foremast to the
Resolution, had one been wanting. Since trees of this size are to be found on so small a spot, it is
reasonable to expect to find some much larger on the main, and larger isles; and, if appearances did
not deceive us, we can assert it.</p><p>If I except New Zealand, I, at this time, knew of no island in the South Pacific Ocean, where a
ship could supply herself with a mast or yard, were she ever so much distressed for want of one.
Thus far the discovery is or may be valuable. My carpenter, who was a mast-maker as well as a
shipwright, two trades he learnt in Deptford-yard, was of opinion that these trees would make
exceedingly good masts. The wood is white, close-grained, tough, and light. Turpentine had exuded
out of most of the trees, and the sun had inspissated it into a rosin, which was found sticking to
the trunks, and lying about the roots. These trees shoot out their branches like all other pines;
with this difference, that the branches of these are much smaller and shorter; so that the knots
become nothing when the tree is wrought for use. I took notice, that the largest of them had the
smallest and shortest branches, and were crowned, as it were, at the top, by a spreading branch like
a bush. This was what led some on board into the extravagant notion of their being basaltes: Indeed
no one could think of finding such trees here. The seeds are produced in cones; but we could find
none that had any in them, or that were in a proper state for vegetation or botanical examination.
Besides these, there was another tree or shrub of the spruce-fir kind, but it was very small. We
also found on the isle a sort of scurvy-grass, and a plant, called by us Lamb's Quarters, which,
when boiled, eat like spinnage.</p><p>Having got ten or twelve small spars to make studding-sail booms, boat-masts, etc., and night
approaching, we returned with them on board.</p><p>The purpose for which I anchored under this isle being answered, I was now to consider what was
next to be done. We had from the top-mast-head taken a view of the sea around us, and observed the
whole, to the west, to be strewed with small islets, sand-banks, and breakers, to the utmost extent
of our horizon. They seemed indeed not to be all connected, and to be divided by winding channels.
But when I considered that the extent of this S.W. coast was already pretty well determined, the
great risk attending a more accurate survey, and the time it would require to accomplish it, on
account of the many dangers we should have to encounter, I determined not to hazard the ship down to
leeward, where we might be so hemmed in as to find it difficult to return, and by that means lose
the proper season for getting to the south. I now wished to have had the little vessel set up, the
frame of which we had on board. I had some thoughts of doing this, when we were last at Otaheite,
but found it could not be executed, without neglecting the caulking and other necessary repairs of
the ship, or staying longer there than the route I had in view would admit. It was now too late to
begin setting her up, and then to use her in exploring this coast; and in our voyage to the south,
she could be of no service. These reasons induced me to try to get without the shoals; that is, to
the southward of them.</p><p>Next morning at day-break, we got under sail with a light breeze at E. by N. We had to make some
trips to weather the shoals to leeward of Botany Isle; but when this was done the breeze began to
fail; and at three p.m. it fell calm. The swell, assisted by the current, set us fast to S.W.
towards the breakers, which were yet in sight in that direction. Thus we continued till <time>ten o'clock</time>,
at which time a breeze springing up at N.N.W. we steered E.S.E.; the contrary course we had come in;
not daring to steer farther south till daylight.</p><p><date>1774 October</date></p><p>At <time>three o'clock</time> next morning, the wind veered to S.W., blew hard, and in squalls, attended with
rain, which made it necessary to proceed with our courses up and top-sails on the cap, till
day-break, when the hill on the Isle of Pines bore north; and our distance from the shore in that
direction was about four leagues. We had now a very strong wind at S.S.W. attended by a great sea;
so that we had reason to rejoice at having got clear of the shoals before this gale overtook us.
Though every thing conspired to make me think this was the westerly monsoon, it can hardly be
comprehended under that name, for several reasons; first, because it was near a month too soon for
these winds; secondly, because we know not if they reach this place at all; and lastly, because it
is very common for westerly winds to blow within the tropics. However, I never found them to blow so
hard before, or so far southerly. Be these things as they may, we had now no other choice but to
stretch to S.E., which we accordingly did with our starboard tacks aboard; and at <time>noon</time> we were out
of sight of land.</p><p>The gale continued with very little alteration till <time>noon</time> next day; at which time we observed in
latitude <geo select="lat" n="1">23° 18' S</geo>, longitude made from the Isle of Pines <geo select="lon" n="1">1° 54' E</geo>. In the <time>afternoon</time> we had little
wind from the south, and a great swell from the same direction: And many boobies, tropic, and
men-of-war birds were seen. At <time>eleven o'clock</time> a fresh breeze sprung up at W. by S., with which we
stood to the south. At this time we were in the latitude of<geo select="lat" n="2"> 23° 18' S</geo> , longitude <geo select="lon" n="2">169° 49' E</geo>., and
about forty-two leagues south of the Hebrides.</p><p>At <time>eight o'clock  in the morning</time>, on the third, the wind veered to S.W. and blew a strong gale by
squalls, attended with rain. I now gave over all thought of returning to the land we had left.
Indeed, when I considered the vast ocean we had to explore to the south; the state and condition of
the ship, already in want of some necessary stores; that summer was approaching fast, and that any
considerable accident might detain us in this sea another year; I did not think it advisable to
attempt to regain the land.</p><p>Thus I was obliged, as it were by necessity, for the first time, to leave a coast I had
discovered, before it was fully explored.—I called it New Caledonia; and, if we except New Zealand,
it is perhaps the largest island in the South Pacific Ocean. For it extends from the latitude of<geo select="lat">19° 
37' S</geo>, to <geo select="lat" n="1">22° 30' S</geo>, S., and from the longitude of <geo select="lon">163° 37' E</geo> to <geo select="lon" n="1">167° 14' E</geo>. It lies nearly N.W. 1/2 W.,
and S.E. 1 E., and is about eighty-seven leagues long in that direction; but its breadth is not
considerable, not any where exceeding ten leagues. It is a country full of hills and valleys; of
various extent both for height and depth. To judge of the whole by the parts we were on, from these
hills spring vast numbers of little rivulets, which greatly contribute to fertilize the plains, and
to supply all the wants of the inhabitants. The summits of most of the hills seem to be barren;
though some few are cloathed with wood; as are all the plains and valleys. By reason of these hills,
many parts of the coast, when at a distance from it, appeared indented, or to have great inlets
between the hills; but, when we came near the shore, we always found such places shut up with low
land, and also observed low land to lie along the coast between the seashore and the foot of the
hills. As this was the case in all such parts as we came near enough to see, it is reasonable to
suppose that the whole coast is so. I am likewise of opinion, that the whole, or greatest part, is
surrounded by reefs or shoals, which render the access to it very dangerous, but at the same time
guard the coast from the violence of the wind and sea; make it abound with fish, secure an easy and
safe navigation along it, for canoes, etc.; and, most likely, form some good harbours for shipping.
Most, if not every part of the coast, is inhabited, the Isle of Pines not excepted; for we saw
either smoke by day, or fires by night, wherever we came. In the extent which I have given to this
island, is included the broken or unconnected lands to the N.W. That they may be connected; I shall
not pretend to deny; we were, however, of opinion that they were isles, and that New Caledonia
terminated more to S.E.; though this at most is but a well-founded conjecture.</p><p>But whether these lands be separate isles, or connected with New Caledonia, it is by no means
certain that we saw their termination to the west. I think we did not; as the shoals did not end
with the land we saw, but kept their N.W. direction farther than Bougainville's track in the
latitude of<geo select="lat">15° S</geo>  or 15.5°. Nay, it seems not improbable, that a chain of isles, sand-banks, and
reefs, may extend to the west, as far as the coast of New South Wales. The eastern extent of the
isles and shoals off that coast, between the latitude of<geo select="lat">15° S</geo>  and 23', were not known. The
resemblance of the two countries; *Bougainville's meeting with the shoal of Diana above sixty
leagues from the coast; and the signs he had of land to the S.E.; all tend to increase the
probability. I must confess that it is carrying probability and conjecture a little too far, to say
what may lie in a space of two hundred leagues; but it is in some measure necessary, were it only to
put some future navigator on his guard.</p><p>[See his Voyage, English translation p.303.]</p><p>Mr Wales determined the longitude of that part of New Caledonia we explored, by ninety-six sets
of observations, which were reduced to one another by our trusty guide the watch. I found the
variation of the compass to be 10° 24' E. This is the mean variation given by the three azimuth
compasses we had on board, which would differ from each other a degree and a half, and sometimes
more. I did not observe any difference in the variation between the N.W. and S.E. parts of this
land, except when we were at anchor before Balade, where it was less than 10°; but this I did not
regard, as I found such an uniformity out at sea; and it is there where navigators want to know the
variation. While we were on the N.E. coast, I thought the currents set to S.E. and W. or N.W. on the
other side; but they are by no means considerable, and may, as probably, be channels of tides, as
regular currents. In the narrow channels which divide the shoals, and those which communicate with
the sea, the tides run strong; but their rise and fall are inconsiderable, not exceeding three feet
and a half. The time of high-water, at the full and change, at Balade, is about <time>six o'clock</time>; but at
Botany Isle we judged it would happen about ten or <time>eleven o'clock</time>.</p></div><div type="chapter"><head><l>CHAPTER XI. </l><l><emph>Sequel of the Passage from New Caledonia to New Zealand, with an Account of the Discovery
of Norfolk Island; and the Incidents that happened while the Ship lay in Queen Charlotte's
Sound.</emph></l></head><p><date>1774 October</date></p><p>The wind continuing at S.W., W.S.W., and W., blowing a fresh gale, and now and then squalls, with
showers of rain, we steered to S.S.E, without meeting with any remarkable occurrence till near <time>noon</time>
on the 6th, when it fell calm. At this time we were in the latitude of <geo select="lat">27° 50' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">171°
43' E</geo>. The calm continued till <time>noon</time> the next day, during which time we observed the variation to be
10° 33' E. I now ordered the carpenters to work to caulk the decks. As we had neither pitch, tar,
nor rosin, left to pay the seams, this was done with varnish of pine, and afterwards covered with
coral sand, which made a cement far exceeding my expectation. In the <time>afternoon</time>, we had a boat in the
water, and shot two albatrosses, which were geese to us. We had seen one of this kind of birds the
day before, which was the first we observed since we had been within the tropic. On the 7th, at one
p.m. a breeze sprung up at south; soon after it veered to, and fixed at S.E. by S., and blew a
gentle gale, attended with pleasant weather.</p><p>We stretched to W.S.W., and next day at <time>noon</time> were in the latitude of <geo select="lat">28° 25' S</geo> , longitude <geo select="lon">170° 26'
E</geo>. In the evening, Mr Cooper haying struck a porpoise with a harpoon, it was necessary to bring-to,
and have two boats out, before we could kill it, and get it on board. It was six feet long; a female
of that kind, which naturalists call dolphin of the ancients, and which differs from the other kind
of porpoise in the head and jaw, having them long and pointed. This had eighty-eight teeth in each
jaw. The haslet and lean flesh were to us a feast. The latter was a little liverish, but had not the
least fishy taste. It was eaten roasted, broiled, and fried, first soaking it in warm water. Indeed,
little art was wanting to make any thing fresh, palatable to those who had been living so long on
salt meat.</p><p>We continued to stretch to W.S.W. till the 10th, when at day-break we discovered land, bearing
S.W., which on a nearer approach we found to be an island of good height, and five leagues in
circuit. I named it Norfolk Isle, in honour of the noble family of Howard. It is situated in the
latitude of <geo select="lat">29° 2' 30" S</geo>. and longitude <geo select="lon">168° 16' E</geo>. The latter was determined by lunar observations
made on this, the preceding, and following days; and the former by a good observation at <time>noon</time>, when
we were about three miles from the isle. Soon after we discovered the isle, we sounded in twenty-two
fathoms on a bank of coral sand; after this we continued to sound, and found not less than
twenty-two; or more than twenty-four fathoms (except near the shore), and the same bottom mixed with
broken shells. After dinner a party of us embarked in two boats, and landed on the island, without
any difficulty, behind some large rocks, which lined part of the coast on the N.E. side.</p><p>We found it uninhabited, and were undoubtedly the first that ever set foot on it. We observed
many trees and plants common at New Zealand; and, in particular, the flax-plant, which is rather
more luxuriant here than in any part of that country; but the chief produce is a sort of
spruce-pine, which grows in great abundance, and to a large size, many of the trees being as thick,
breast high, as two men could fathom, and exceedingly straight and tall. This pine is a sort between
that which grows in New Zealand, and that in New Caledonia; the foliage differing something from
both, and the wood not so heavy as the former, nor so light and close-grained as the latter. It is a
good deal like the Quebec pine. For about two hundred yards from the shore, the ground is covered so
thick with shrubs and plants, as hardly to be penetrated farther inland. The woods were perfectly
clear and free from underwood, and the soil seemed rich and deep.</p><p>We found the same kind of pigeons, parrots, and parroquets as in New Zealand, rails, and some
small birds. The sea-fowl are, white boobies, gulls, tern, etc. which breed undisturbed on the
shores, and in the cliffs of the rocks.</p><p>On the isle is fresh water; and cabbage-palm, wood-sorrel, sow-thistle, and samphire, abounding
in some places on the shore, we brought on board as much of each sort as the time we had to gather
them would admit. These cabbage-trees or palms were not thicker than a man's leg, and from ten to
twenty feet high. They are of the same genus with the cocoa-nut tree; like it they have large
pinnated leaves, and are the same as the second sort found in the northern parts of New South
Wales*. The cabbage is, properly speaking, the bud of the tree; each tree producing but one cabbage,
which is at the crown, where the leaves spring out, and is inclosed in the stem. The cutting off the
cabbage effectually destroys the tree; so that no more than one can be had from the same stem. The
cocoa-nut tree, and some others of the palm kind, produce cabbage as well as these. This vegetable
is not only wholesome, but exceedingly palatable, and proved the most agreeable repast we had for
some time.</p><p>[Vide Hawkesworth's Voyages, Vol III, Page 624.]</p><p>The coast does not want fish. While we were on shore, the people in the boats caught some which
were excellent. I judged that it was high water at the full and change, about <time>one o'clock</time>; and that
the tide rises and falls upon a perpendicular about four or five feet.</p><p>The approach of night brought us all on board, when we hoisted in the boats, and stretched to
E.N.E. (with the wind at S.E.) till midnight, when we tacked, and spent the remainder of the night
making short boards.</p><p>Next morning at sun-rise, we made sail, stretching to S.S.W., and weathered the island; on the
south side of which lie two isles, that serve as roosting and breeding-places for birds. On this, as
also on the S.E. side, is a sandy beach; whereas most of the other shores are bounded by rocky
cliffs, which have twenty and eighteen fathoms water close to them: At least so we found it on the
N.E. side, and with good anchorage. A bank of coral sand, mixed with shells, on which we found from
nineteen to thirty-five or forty fathoms water, surrounds the isle, and extends, especially to the
south, seven leagues off. The morning we discovered the island, the variation was found to be 13° 9'
E.; but I think this observation gave too much, as others which we had, both before and after, gave
2° less.</p><p>After leaving Norfolk Isle, I steered for New Zealand, my intention being to touch at Queen
Charlotte's Sound, to refresh my crew, and put the ship in a condition to encounter the southern
latitudes.</p><p>On the 17th, at day-break, we saw Mount Egmont, which was covered with everlasting snow, bearing
S.E. 1/2 E. Our distance from the shore was about eight leagues, and, on sounding, we found seventy
fathoms water, a muddy bottom. The wind soon fixed in the western board, and blew a fresh gale, with
which we steered S.S.E. for Queen Charlotte's Sound, with a view of falling in with Cape Stephens.
At <time>noon</time> Cape Egmont bore E.N.E. distant three or four leagues; and though the mount was hid in the
clouds, we judged it to be in the same direction as the Cape; latitude observed <geo select="lat">39° 24' S</geo> . The wind
increased in such a manner as to oblige us to close-reef our top-sails, and strike top-gallant
yards. At last we could bear no more sail than the two courses, and two close-reefed top-sails; and
under them we stretched for Cape Stephens, which we made at <time>eleven o'clock</time> at night.</p><p>At midnight we tacked and made a trip to the north till <time>three o'clock</time> next morning, when we bore
away for the sound. At nine we hauled round Point Jackson through a sea which looked terrible,
occasioned by a rapid tide, and a high wind; but as we knew the coast, it did not alarm us. At
<time>eleven o'clock</time> we anchored before Ship Cove; the strong flurries from off the land not permitting us
to get in.</p><p>In the <time>afternoon</time>, as we could not move the ship, I went into the Cove, with the seine, to try to
catch some fish. The first thing I did after landing, was to look for the bottle I left hid when
last there, in which was the memorandum. It was taken away, but by whom it did not appear. Two hauls
with the seine producing only four small fish, we, in some measure, made up for this deficiency, by
shooting several birds, which the flowers in the garden had drawn thither, as also some old shags,
and by robbing the nests of some young ones.</p><p>Being little wind next morning, we weighed and warped the ship into the Cove, and there moored
with the two bowers. We unbent the sails to repair them; several having been split, and otherwise
damaged in the late gale. The main and fore courses, already worn to the very utmost, were condemned
as useless. I ordered the top-masts to be struck and unrigged, in order to fix to them moveable
chocks or knees, for want of which the trestle-trees were continually breaking; the forge to be set
up, to make bolts and repair our iron-work; and tents to be erected on shore for the reception of a
guard, coopers, sail-makers, etc. I likewise gave orders that vegetables (of which there were
plenty) should be boiled every morning with oatmeal and portable broth for breakfast, and with pease
and broth every day for dinner for the whole crew, over and above their usual allowance of salt
meat.</p><p>In the <time>afternoon</time>, as Mr Wales was setting up his observatory, he discovered that several trees,
which were standing when we last sailed from this place, had been cut down with saws and axes; and a
few days after, the place where an observatory, clock, etc. had been set up, was also found, in a
spot different from that where Mr Wales had placed his. It was, therefore, now no longer to be
doubted, that the Adventure had been in this cove after we had left it.</p><p>Next day, wind southerly; hazy clouded weather. Every body went to work at their respective
employments, one of which was to caulk the ship's sides, a thing much wanted. The seams were paid
with putty, made with cook's fat and chalk; the gunner happening to have a quantity of the latter on
board.</p><p>The 21st, wind southerly, with continual rains.</p><p>The weather being fair in the <time>afternoon</time> of the 22d, accompanied by the botanists, I visited our
gardens on Motuara, which we found almost in a state of nature, having been wholly neglected by the
inhabitants. Nevertheless, many articles were in a flourishing condition, and shewed how well they
liked the soil in which they were planted. None of the natives having yet made their appearance, we
made a fire on the point of the island, in hopes, if they saw the smoke, they might be induced to
come to us.</p><p>Nothing remarkable happened till the 24th, when, in the morning, two canoes were seen coming down
the sound; but as soon as they perceived the ship, they retired behind a point on the west side.
After breakfast I went in a boat to look for them; and as we proceeded along the shore, we shot
several birds. The report of the muskets gave notice of our approach, and the natives discovered
themselves in Shag Cove by hallooing to us; but as we drew near to their habitations, they all fled
to the woods, except two or three men, who stood on a rising ground near the shore, with their arms
in their hands. The moment we landed, they knew us. Joy then took place of fear; and the rest of the
natives hurried out of the woods, and embraced us over and over again; leaping and skipping about
like madmen, but I observed that they would not suffer some women, whom we saw at a distance, to
come near us. After we had made them presents of hatchets, knives, and what else we had with us,
they gave us in return a large quantity of fish, which they had just caught. There were only a few
amongst them whose faces we could recognise, and on our asking why they were afraid of us, and
enquiring for some of our old acquaintances by name, they talked much about killing, which was so
variously understood by us, that we could gather nothing from it, so that, after a short stay, we
took leave, and went on board.</p><p>Next morning early, our friends, according to a promise they had made us the preceding evening,
paying us a visit, brought with them a quantity of fine fish, which they exchanged for Otaheitean
cloth, etc. and then returned to their habitations.</p><p>On the 26th, we got into the after-hold four boat-load of shingle ballast, and struck down six
guns, keeping only six on deck. Our good friends the natives, having brought us a plentiful supply
of fish, afterwards went on shore to the tents, and informed our people there, that a ship like ours
had been lately lost in the strait; that some of the people got on shore; and that the natives stole
their clothes, etc. for which several were shot; and afterwards, when they could fire no longer, the
natives having got the better, killed them with their patapatoos, and eat them, but that they
themselves had no hand in the affair, which, they said, happened at Vanna Aroa, near Terrawhitte, on
the other side of the strait. One man said it was two moons ago: But another contradicted him, and
counted on his fingers about twenty or thirty days. They described by actions how the ship was beat
to pieces by going up and down against the rocks, till at last it was all scattered abroad.</p><p>The next day some others told the same story, or nearly to the same purport, and pointed over the
east bay, which is on the east side of the sound, as to the place where it happened. These stories
making me very uneasy about the Adventure, I desired Mr Wales, and those on shore, to let me know if
any of the natives should mention it again, or to send them to me; for I had not heard any thing
from them myself. When Mr Wales came on board to dinner he found the very people who had told him
the story on shore, and pointed them out to me. I enquired about the affair, and endeavoured to come
at the truth by every method I could think of. All I could get from them was, "Caurey," (no); and
they not only denied every syllable of what they had said on shore, but seemed wholly ignorant of
the matter; so that I began to think our people had misunderstood them, and that the story referred
to some of their own people and boats.</p><p>On the 28th, fresh gales westerly, and fair weather. We rigged and fitted the top-masts. Having
gone on a shooting-party to West Bay, we went to the place where I left the hogs and fowls; but saw
no vestiges of them, nor of any body having been there since. In our return, having visited the
natives, we got some fish in exchange for trifles which we gave them. As we were coming away, Mr
Forster thought be heard the squeaking of a pig in the woods, close by their habitations; probably
they may have those I left with them when last here. In the evening we got on board, with about a
dozen and a half of wild fowl, shags, and sea-pies. The sportsmen who had been out in the woods near
the ship were more successful among the small birds.</p><p>On the 29th and 30th nothing remarkable happened, except that in the evening of the latter all
the natives left us.</p><p>The 31st being a fine pleasant day, our botanists went over to Long Island, where one of the
party saw a large black boar. As it was described to me, I thought it might be one of those which
Captain Furneaux left behind, and had been brought over to this isle by those who had it in keeping.
Since they did not destroy those hogs when first in their possession, we cannot suppose they will do
it now; so that there is little fear but that this country will in time be stocked with these
animals, both in a wild and domestic state.</p><p><date>1774 November</date></p><p>Next day we were visited by a number of strangers who came up from the sound, and brought with
them but little fish. Their chief commodity was green stone or talc, an article which never came to
a bad market; and some of the largest pieces of it I had ever seen were got this day.</p><p>On the 2d I went over to the east side of the sound, and, without meeting any thing remarkable,
returned on board in the evening, when I learnt that the same people who visited us the preceding
day, had been on board most of this, with their usual article of trade.</p><p>On the 3d, Mr Pickersgill met with some of the natives, who related to him the story of a ship
being lost, and the people being killed; but added, with great earnestness, it was not done by
them.</p><p>On the 4th, fine pleasant weather. Most of the natives now retired up the sound. Indeed, I had
taken every gentle method, to oblige them to be gone, for since these newcomers had been with us,
our old friends had disappeared, and we had been without fish. Having gone over to Long Island, to
look for the hog which had been seen there, I found it to be one of the sows left by Captain
Furneaux; the same that was in the possession of the natives when we were last here. From the
supposition of its being a boar, I had carried over a sow to leave with him; but on seeing my
mistake, brought her back, as the leaving her there would answer no end.</p><p>Early in the morning of the 5th, our old friends made us a visit, and brought a seasonable supply
of fish. At the same time I embarked in the pinnace, with Messrs Forsters and Sparrman, in order to
proceed up the sound. I was desirous of finding the termination of it; or rather of seeing if I
could find any passage out to sea by the S.E., as I suspected from some discoveries I had made when
first here. In our way up, we met with some fishers, of whom we made the necessary enquiry; and they
all agreed that there was no passage to the sea by the head of the sound. As we proceeded, we, some
time after, met a canoe conducted by four men coming down the sound. These confirmed what the others
had said, in regard to there being no passage to the sea the way we were going; but gave us to
understand that there was one to the east, in the very place where I expected to find it. I now laid
aside the scheme of going to the head of the sound, and proceeded to this arm, which is on the S.E.
side, about four or five leagues above the isle of Motuara.</p><p>A little within the entrance on the S.E. side, at a place called Kotieghenooee, we found a large
settlement of the natives., The chief, whose name was Tringo-boohee, and his people, whom we found
to be some of those who had lately been on board the ship, received us with great courtesy. They
seemed to be pretty numerous both here and in the neighbourhood. Our stay with them was short, as
the information they gave us encouraged us to pursue the object we had in view. Accordingly, we
proceeded down the arm E.N.E. and E. by N., leaving several fine coves on both sides, and at last
found it to open into the strait by a channel about a mile wide, in which ran out a strong tide;
having also observed one setting down the arm, all the time we had been in it. It was now about four
o'clock in the <time>afternoon</time>, and in less than an hour after, this tide ceased, and was succeeded by the
flood, which came in with equal strength.</p><p>The outlet lies S.E. by E. and N.W. by W. and nearly in the direction of E.S.E. and W.N.W. from
Cape Terrawhitte. We found thirteen fathoms water a little within the entrance, clear ground. It
seemed to me that a leading wind was necessary to go in and out of this passage, on account of the
rapidity of the tides. I, however, had but little time to make observations of this nature, as night
was at hand, and I had resolved to return on board. On that account I omitted visiting a large
<emph>hippa</emph>, or strong-hold, built on an elevation on the north side, and about a mile or two
within the entrance, The inhabitants of it, by signs, invited us to go to them; but, without paying
any regard to them, we proceeded directly for the ship, which we reached by <time>ten o'clock</time>, bringing
with us some fish we had got from the natives, and a few birds we had shot. Amongst the latter were
some of the same kinds of ducks we found in Dusky Bay, and we have reason to believe that they are
all to be met with here. For the natives knew them all by the drawings, and had a particular name
for each.</p><p>On the 6th, wind at N.E., gloomy weather with rain. Our old friends having taken up their abode
near us, one of them, whose name was Pedero, (a man of some note,) made me a present of a staff of
honour, such as the chiefs generally carry. In return, I dressed him in a suit of old clothes, of
which he was not a little proud. He had a fine person, and a good presence, and nothing but his
colour distinguished him from an European. Having got him, and another, into a communicative mood,
we began to enquire of them if the Adventure had been there during my absence; and they gave us to
understand, in a manner which admitted of no doubt, that, soon after we were gone, she arrived; that
she staid between ten and twenty days, and had been gone ten months. They likewise asserted that
neither she, nor any other ship, had been stranded on the coast, as had been reported. This
assertion, and the manner in which they related the coming and going of the Adventure, made me easy
about her; but did not wholly set aside our suspicions of a disaster having happened to some other
strangers. Besides what has been already related, we had been told that a ship had lately been here,
and was gone to a place called Terato, which is on the north side of the strait. Whether this story
related to the former or no, I cannot say. Whenever I questioned the natives about it, they always
denied all knowledge of it, and for some time past, had avoided mentioning it. It was but a few days
before, that one man received a box on the ear for naming it to some of our people.</p><p>After breakfast I took a number of hands over to Long Island, in order to catch the sow, to put
her to the boar and remove her to some other place; but we returned without seeing her. Some of the
natives had been there not long before us, as their fires were yet burning; and they had undoubtedly
taken her away. Pedero dined with us, eat of every thing at table, and drank more wine than any one
of us, without being in the least affected by it.</p><p>The 7th, fresh gales at N.E. with continual rain.</p><p>The 8th, fore-part rain, remainder fair weather. We put two pigs, a boar, and a sow, on shore, in
the cove next without Cannibal Cove; so that it is hardly possible all the methods I have taken to
stock this country with these animals should fail. We had also reason to believe that some of the
cocks and hens which I left here still existed, although we had not seen any of them; for an hen's
egg was, some days before, found in the woods almost new laid.</p><p>On the 9th, wind westerly or N.W., squally with rain. In the morning we unmoored, and shifted our
birth farther out of the cove, for the more ready getting to sea the next morning; for at present
the caulkers had not finished the sides, and till this work was done we could not sail. Our friends
having brought us a very large and seasonable supply of fish, I bestowed on Pedero a present of an
empty oil-jar, which made him as happy as a prince. Soon after, he and his party left the cove, and
retired to their proper place of abode, with all the treasure they had received from us. I believe
that they gave away many of the things they, at different times, got from us, to their friends and
neighbours, or else parted with them to purchase peace of their more powerful enemies; for we never
saw any of our presents after they were once in their possession: And every time we visited them
they were as much in want of hatchets, nails, etc. to all appearance, as if they never had had any
among them.</p><p>I am satisfied that the people in this sound, who are, upon the whole, pretty numerous, are under
no regular form of government, or so united as to form one body politic. The head of each tribe, or
family, seems to be respected; and that respect may, on some occasions, command obedience; but I
doubt if any amongst them have either a right or power to enforce it. The day we were with
Tringo-boohee, the people came from all parts to see us, which he endeavoured to prevent. But though
he went so far as to throw stones at some, I observed that very few paid any regard either to his
words or actions; and yet this man was spoken of as a chief of some note. I have, before, made some
remarks on the evils attending these people for want of union among themselves; and the more I was
acquainted with them, the more I found it to be so. Notwithstanding they are cannibals, they are
naturally of a good disposition, and have not a little humanity.</p><p>In the <time>afternoon</time> a party of us went ashore into one of the coves, where were two families of the
natives variously employed; some sleeping, some making mats, others roasting fish and fir roots, and
one girl, I observed, was heating of stones. Curious to know what they were for, I remained near
her. As soon as the stones were made hot, she took them out of the fire, and gave them to an old
woman, who was sitting in the hut. She placed them in a heap, laid over them a handful of green
celery, and over that a coarse mat, and then squatted herself down, on her heels, on the top of all;
thus making a kind of Dutch warming-pan, on which she sat as close as a hare on her seat. I should
hardly have mentioned this operation, if I had thought it had no other view than to warm the old
woman's backside. I rather suppose it was intended to cure some disorder she might have on her,
which the steams arising from the green celery might be a specific for. I was led to think so by
there being hardly any celery in the place, we having gathered it long before; and grass, of which
there was great plenty, would have kept the stones from burning the mat full as well, if that had
been all that was meant. Besides, the woman looked to me sickly, and not in a good state of
health.</p><p>Mr Wales, from time to time, communicated to me the observations he had made in this Sound for
determining the longitude, the mean results of which give <geo select="lon">174° 25' 7.5" E</geo>ast, for the bottom of
Ship Cove, where the observations were made; and the latitude of it is <geo select="lat">41° 5' 50.5" S</geo>outh. In my
chart, constituted in my former voyage, this place is laid down in <geo select="lon">184° 54' 30" W</geo>est, equal to 175°
5' 30" east. The error of the chart is therefore 0° 40' 0", and nearly equal to what was found at
Dusky Bay; by which it appears that the whole of Tavai-poenamoo is laid down 40' too far east in the
said chart, as well as in the journal of the voyage. But the error in Eaheino-mauwe, is not more
than half a degree, or thirty minutes; because the distance between. Queen Charlotte's Sound and
Cape Palliser has been found to be greater by 10' of longitude than it is laid down in the chart. I
mention these errors, not from a fear that they will affect either navigation or geography, but
because I have no doubt of their existence; for, from the multitude of observations which Mr Wales
took, the situation of few parts of the world is better ascertained than Queen Charlotte's Sound.
Indeed, I might, with equal truth, say the same of all the other places where we made any stay; for
Mr Wales, whose abilities are equal to his assiduity, lost no one observation that could possibly be
obtained. Even the situation of those islands, which we passed without touching at them, is, by
means of Kendal's watch, determined with almost equal accuracy. The error of the watch from Otaheite
to this place was only 43' 39.5" in longitude, reckoning at the rate it was found to go at, at
that island and at Tanna; but by reckoning at the rate it was going when last at Queen Charlotte's
Sound, and from the time of our leaving it, to our return to it again, which was near a year, the
error was 19' 31", 25 in time, or 4° 52' 48" 1/4 in longitude. This error cannot be thought great,
if we consider the length of time, and that we had gone over a space equal to upwards of
three-fourths of the equatorial circumference of the earth, and through all the climates and
latitudes from 9° to 71°. Mr Wales found its rate of going here to be that of gaining 12",576, on
mean time, per day.</p><p>The mean result of all the observations he made for ascertaining the variation of the compass and
the dip of the south end of the needle, the three several times we had been here, gave 14° 9' 1/5
east for the former; and 64° 36" 2/3 for the latter. He also found, from very accurate observations,
that the time of high-water preceded the moon's southing, on the full and change days, by three

there were evident tokens on the beach, of its having risen two feet higher than ever it did in the
course of his experiments.</p></div></div><div type="book"><head><l>A VOYAGE TOWARDS THE SOUTH POLE, AND ROUND THE WORLD.</l><l>BOOK IV.</l><l>FROM LEAVING NEW ZEALAND TO OUR RETURN TO ENGLAND.</l></head><div type="chapter"><head><l>CHAPTER I. </l><l><emph>The Run from New Zealand to Terra del Fuego, with the Range from Cape Deseada to Christmas

and, after getting round the Two Brothers, steered for Cape Campbell, which is at the S.W. entrance
of the Strait, all sails set, with a fine breeze at north. At four in the <time>afternoon</time>, we passed the
Cape, at the distance of four or five leagues, and then steered S.S.E. 1/2 E. with the wind at N.W.,
a gentle gale, and cloudy weather.</p><p>Next morning the wind veered round by the west to south, and forced us more to the east than I
intended. At <time>seven o'clock  in the evening</time>, the snowy mountains bore W. by S., and Cape Palliser N.
1/2 W., distant sixteen or seventeen leagues; from which cape I, for the third time, took my
departure. After a few hours calm, a breeze springing up at north, we steered S. by E. all sails
set, with a view of getting into the latitude of 54°  or 55°; my intention being to cross this vast
ocean nearly in these parallels, and so as to pass over those parts which were left unexplored the
preceding summer.</p><p>In the morning of the 12th, the wind increased to a fine gale: At <time>noon</time> we observed in latitude
<geo select="lat" n="1">43° 13.5' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">176° 41' E</geo>.; an extraordinary fish of the whale kind was seen, which some
called a sea monster. I did not see it myself. In the <time>afternoon</time>, our old companions the pintado
peterels began to appear.</p><p>On the 13th, in the morning, the wind veered to W.S.W. At seven, seeing the appearance of land to
S.W., we hauled up towards it, and soon found it to be a fog-bank. Afterwards we steered S.E. by S.,
and soon after saw a seal. At <time>noon</time>, latitude, by account, <geo select="lat" n="1">44° 25' S</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">177° 31' E</geo>. Foggy
weather, which continued all the <time>afternoon</time>. At six in the evening, the wind veered to N.E. by N.,
and increased to a fresh gale, attended with thick hazy weather; course steered S.E. 1/4 S.</p><p>On the 14th, a.m. saw another seal. At <time>noon</time>, latitude <geo select="lat" n="1">45° 54' S</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">179° 29' E</geo>.</p><p>On the 15th, a.m. the wind veered to the westward; the fog cleared away, but the weather
continued cloudy. At <time>noon</time>, latitude <geo select="lat" n="1">47° 30' S</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">178° 19' W</geo>.; for, having passed the meridian
of <geo select="lon">180° E</geo>., <geo>I now reckon my longitude west of the first meridian, viz. Greenwich</geo>. In the evening
heard penguins, and the next morning saw some sea or rock weed. At <time>noon</time> a fresh gale from the west
and fine weather. Latitude observed <geo select="lat" n="2">49° 33' S</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon" n="2">175° 31' W</geo>.</p><p>Next morning fresh gales and hazy weather; saw a seal and several pieces of weed. At <time>noon</time>,
latitude <geo select="lat" n="1">51° 12' S</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">173° 17' W</geo>. The wind veered to the N. and N.E. by N., blew a strong gale
by squalls, which split an old topgallant sail, and obliged us to double-reef the top-sails; but in
the evening the wind moderated, and veered to W.N.W., when we loosed a reef out of each top-sail;
and found the variation of the compass to be 9° 52' E., being then in the latitude <geo select="lat" n="2">51° 47' S</geo>,
longitude <geo select="lon" n="2">172° 21' W</geo>., and the next morning, the 18th, in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="3">52° 25' S</geo> , longitude <geo select="lon" n="3">170°
45' W</geo>., it was 10° 26' E. Towards <time>noon</time>, had moderate but cloudy weather, and a great swell from the
west: Some penguins and pieces of sea-weed seen.</p><p>On the 19th, steered E.S.E, with a very fresh gale at north, hazy dirty weather. At <time>noon</time>,
latitude <geo select="lat" n="1">53° 43' S</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">166° 15' W</geo>.</p><p>On the 20th, steered E. by S., with a moderate breeze at north, attended with thick hazy weather.
At <time>noon</time>, latitude <geo select="lat" n="1">54° 8' S</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">162° 18' W</geo>.</p><p>On the 21st, winds mostly from the N.E., a fresh gale attended with thick, hazy, dirty weather.
Course S.E. by S.; latitude, at <time>noon</time>, <geo select="lat">55° 31' S</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon">160° 29' W</geo>; abundance of blue peterels and
some penguins seen.</p><p>Fresh gales at N.W. by N. and N. by W., and hazy till towards <time>noon</time> of the 22d, when the weather
cleared up, and we observed in latitude <geo select="lat">55° 48' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">156° 56' W</geo>. In the <time>afternoon</time> had a few
hours calm; after that, the wind came at S.S.E. and S.E. by S. a light breeze, with which we steered
east northerly. In the night the aurora australis was visible, but very faint, and no ways
remarkable.</p><p>On the 23d, in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="1">55° 46' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">156° 13' W</geo>., the variation was 9° 42' E. We
had a calm from ten in the morning till six in the evening, when a breeze sprung up at west; at
first it blew a gentle gale, but afterwards freshened. Our course was now E. 1/2 N.</p><p>On the 24th, a fresh breeze at N.W. by W. and N. by W. At <time>noon</time>, in latitude <geo select="lat" n="1">55° 38' S</geo>., longitude
<geo select="lon" n="1">153° 37' W</geo>., foggy in the night, but next day had a fine gale at N.W., attended with clear pleasant
weather; course steered E. by N. In the evening, being in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="2">55° 8' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="2">148°
10' W</geo>., the variation, by the mean of two compasses, was 6° 35' E.</p><p>Having a steady fresh gale at N.N.W. on the 26th and 27th, we steered east; and at <time>noon</time> on the
latter were in latitude <geo select="lat" n="1">55° 6' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">138° 56' W</geo>.</p><p>I now gave up all hopes of finding any more land in this ocean, and came to a resolution to steer
directly for the west entrance of the Straits of Magalhaeus, with a view of coasting the out, or
south side of Terra del Fuego round Cape Horn to the strait Le Maire. As the world has but a very
imperfect knowledge of this shore, I thought the coasting of it would be of more advantage, both to
navigation and to geography, than any thing I could expect to find in a higher latitude. In the
<time>afternoon</time> of this day, the wind blew in squalls, and carried away the main top-gallant mast.</p><p>A very strong gale northerly, with hazy rainy weather, on the 28th, obliged us to double-reef the
fore and main top-sail to hand the mizen top-sail, and get down the fore top-gallant yard. In the
morning, the bolt rope of the main top-sail broke, and occasioned the sail to be split. I have
observed that the ropes to all our sails, the square sails especially, are not of a size and
strength sufficient to wear out the canvass. At <time>noon</time>, latitude <geo select="lat">55° 20' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">134° 16' W</geo>., a
great swell from N.W.: Albatrosses and blue peterels seen.</p><p>Next day towards <time>noon</time>, the wind abating, we loosed all the reefs out of the top-sails, rigged
another top-gallant mast, and got the yards across. P.M. little wind, and hazy weather; at midnight
calm, that continued till <time>noon</time> the next day, when a breeze sprung up at east, with which we
stretched to the northward. At this time we were in the latitude <geo select="lat">55° 32' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">128° 45' W</geo>.;
some albatrosses and peterels seen. At eight, p.m., the wind veering to N.E., we tacked and stood to
E.S.E.</p><p><date>1774 December</date></p><p>On the 1st of December, thick hazy weather, with drizzling rain, and a moderate breeze of wind,
which, at <time>three o'clock</time> p.m. fell to a calm; at this time in latitude <geo select="lat">55° 41' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">127° 5'
W</geo>. After four hours calm, the fog cleared away, and we got a wind at S.E. with which we stood
N.E.</p><p>Next day, a fresh breeze at S.E. and hazy foggy weather, except a few hours in the morning, when
we found the variation to be 1° 28' E. Latitude <geo select="lat" n="1">55° 17' S</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">125° 41' W</geo>. The variation after
this was supposed to increase; for on the 4th, in the morning, being in latitude <geo select="lat" n="2">53° 31' S</geo>, longitude
<geo select="lon" n="2">121° 31' W</geo>., it was 3° 16' E.; in the evening, in latitude <geo select="lat" n="3">53° 13' S</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon" n="3">119° 46' W</geo>., it was 3°
28' E.; and on the 5th, at <time>six o'clock  in the evening</time>, in latitude <geo select="lat" n="4">53° 8' S</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon" n="4">115° 58' W</geo>., it
was 4° 1' E.</p><p>For more than twenty-four hours, having had a fine gale at south, this enabled us to steer east,
with very little deviation to the north; and the wind now altering to S.W. and blowing a steady
fresh breeze, we continued to steer east, inclining a little to south.</p><p>On the 6th, had some snow-showers. In the evening, being in latitude <geo select="lat" n="1">53° 13' S</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">111° 12' W</geo>,
the variation was 4° 58' E.; and the next morning, being in latitude <geo select="lat" n="2">58° 16' S</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon" n="2">109° 33' W</geo>, it
was 5° 1' E.</p><p>The wind was now at west, a fine pleasant gale, sometimes with showers of rain. Nothing
remarkable happened, till the 9th, at <time>noon</time>, when being in the latitude of <geo select="lat">53° 37' S</geo> , longitude <geo select="lon">103°
44' W</geo>., the wind veered to N.E., and afterwards came insensibly round to the south, by the E. and
S.E., attended with cloudy hazy weather, and some showers of rain.</p><p>On the 10th, a little before <time>noon</time>, latitude <geo select="lat" n="1">54° S</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">102° 7' W</geo>est, passed a small bed of
sea-weed. In the <time>afternoon</time> the wind veered to S.W., blew a fresh gale, attended with dark cloudy
weather. We steered east half a point north; and the next day, at six in the evening, being in
latitude <geo select="lat" n="2">53° 35' S</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon" n="2">95° 52' W</geo>est, the variation was 9° 58' east. Many and various sorts of
<rs type="object">albatrosses</rs> about the ship.</p><p>On the 12th, the wind veered to the west, N.W.; and in the evening to north; and, at last, left
us to a calm; that continued till midnight, when we got a breeze at south; which, soon after,
veering to, and fixing at, west, we steered east; and on the 14th, in the morning, found the
variation to be 13° 25' east, latitude <geo select="lat" n="1">53° 25' S</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">87° 53' W</geo>est; and in the <time>afternoon</time>, being
in the same latitude, and the longitude of <geo select="lon">86° 2' W</geo>est, it was 15° 3' east, and increased in such a
manner, that on the 15th, in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="2">53° 30' S</geo> , longitude <geo select="lon" n="2">82° 23' W</geo>est, it was 17° east; and
the next evening, in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="3">53° 25' S</geo> , longitude <geo select="lon" n="3">78° 40' W</geo>, it was 17° 38' east. About this
time, we saw a penguin and a piece of weed; and the next morning, a seal and some diving peterels.
For the three last days, the wind had been at west, a steady fresh gale, attended, now and then,
with showers of rain or hail.</p><p>At six in the morning of the 17th, being <geo select="lat" n="1">53° 25' S</geo> nearly in the same latitude as above, and in the
longitude of <geo select="lon" n="1">77° 10' W</geo>est, the variation was 18° 33' east; and in the <time>afternoon</time> it was 21° 38, being
at that time in latitude <geo select="lat" n="2">53° 16' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="2">75° 9' W</geo>est. In the morning, as well as in the
<time>afternoon</time>, I took some observations to determine the longitude by the watch; and the results,
reduced to <time>noon</time>, gave <geo select="lon">76° 18' 30" W</geo>est. At the same time, the longitude, by my reckoning, was <geo select="lon">76°
17' W</geo>est. But I have reason to think, that we were about half a degree more to the west than either
the one or the other; our latitude, at the same time, was <geo select="lat">53° 21' S</geo>.</p><p>We steered E. by N. and E. 1/2 N. all this day, under all the sail we could carry, with a fine
fresh gale at N.W. by W. in expectation of seeing the land before night; but not making it till ten
o'clock, we took in the studding-sails, top-gallant sails, and a reef in each top-sail, and steered
E.N.E., in order to make sure of falling in with Cape Deseada.</p><p>Two hours after, we made the land, extending from N.E. by N. to E. by S. about six leagues
distant. On this discovery, we wore and brought-to, with the ship's head to the south; and having
sounded, found seventy-five fathoms water, the bottom stone and shells. The land now before us could
be no other than the west coast of Terra del Fuego, and near the west entrance to the Straits of
Magalhaens.</p><p>As this was the first run that had been made directly across this ocean, in a high southern
latitude*, I have been a little particular in noting every circumstance that appeared in the least
material: and, after all, I must observe, that I never made a passage any where of such length, or
even much shorter, where so few interesting circumstances occurred. For, if I except the variation
of the compass, I know of nothing else worth notice. The weather had been neither unusually stormy
nor cold. Before we arrived in the latitude of<geo select="lat">50° S</geo> , the mercury in the thermometer fell gradually
from sixty to fifty; and after we arrived in the latitude of<geo select="lat">55° S</geo> , it was generally between
forty-seven and forty-five; once or twice it fell to forty-three. These observations were made at
<time>noon</time>.</p><p>[It is not to be supposed that I could known at this time, that the Adventure had made the
passage before me.] </p><p>I have now done with the southern Pacific Ocean; and flatter myself that no one will think that I
have left it unexplored; or that more could have been done, in one voyage, towards obtaining that
end, than has been done in this.</p><p>Soon after we left New Zealand, Mr Wales contrived, and fixed up, an instrument, which very
accurately measured the angle the ship rolled, when sailing large and in a great sea; and that in
which she lay down, when sailing upon a wind. The greatest angle he observed her to roll was 38°.
This was on the 6th of this month, when the sea was not unusually high; so that it cannot be
reckoned the greatest roll she had made. The most he observed her to heel or lie down, when sailing
upon a wind, was 18°; and this was under double-reefed top-sails and courses.</p><p>On the 18th, at three in the morning, we sounded again, and found one hundred and ten fathoms,
the same bottom as before. We now made sail with a fresh gale at N.W., and steered S.E. by E. along
the coast. It extended from Cape Deseada, which bore north <geo select="lon">7° E</geo>ast, to E S.E.; a pretty high ragged
isle, which lies near a league from the main, and S., <geo select="lon">18° E</geo>. six leagues E. from Cape Deseada, bore
N. 49° E. distant four leagues; and it obtained the name of Landfall. At <time>four o'clock</time>, we were north
and south of the high land of Cape Deseada, distant about nine leagues; so that we saw none of the
low rocks said to lie off it. The latitude of this Cape is about <geo select="lat">53° S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">74° 40' W</geo>est.</p><p>Continuing to range the coast, at about two leagues distance, at <time>eleven o'clock</time> we passed a
projecting point, which I called Cape Gloucester. It shews a round surface of considerable height,
and has much the appearance of being an island. It lies S.S.E. 1/2 E. distant seventeen leagues from
the isle of Landfall. The coast between them forms two bays, strewed with rocky islets, rocks, and
breakers. The coast appeared very broken with many inlets; or rather it seemed to be composed of a
number of islands. The land is very mountainous, rocky, and barren, spotted here and there with
tufts of wood, and patches of snow. At <time>noon</time> Cape Gloucester bore north, distant eight miles, and the
most advanced point of land to the S.E., which we judged to be Cape Noir, bore S.E. by S., distant
seven or eight leagues. Latitude observed <geo select="lat">54° 13' S</geo>. Longitude, made from Cape Deseada, 54' E. From
Cape Gloucester, off which lies a small rocky island, the direction of the coast is nearly S.E.; but
to Cape Noir, for which we steered, the course is S.S.E., distant about ten leagues.</p><p>At <time>three o'clock</time> we passed Cape Noir, which is a steep rock of considerable height, and the S.W.
point of a large island that seemed to lie detached, a league, or a league and a half, from the main
land. The land of the cape, when at a distance from it, appeared to be an island disjoined from the
other; but, on a nearer approach, we found it connected by a low neck of land. At the point of the
cape are two rocks; the one peaked like a sugar- loaf, the other not so high, and shewing a rounder
surface; and S. by E., two leagues from the cape, are two other rocky islets. This cape is situated
in the latitude of <geo select="lat">54° 30' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">73° 33' W</geo>.</p><p>After passing the two islets, we steered E.S.E., crossing the great bay of St Barbara. We but
just saw the land in the bottom of it, which could not be less than seven or eight leagues from us.
There was a space, lying in the direction of E.N.E. from Cape Noir, where no land was to be seen:
this may be the channel of St Barbara, which opens into the straits of Magalhaens, as mentioned by
Frezier. We found the cape to agree very well with his description, which shews that he laid down
the channel from good memoirs. At <time>ten o'clock</time>, drawing near the S.E. point of the bay, which, lies
nearly in the direction of S. 60° E. from Cape Noir, eighteen leagues distant, we shortened sail,
and spent the night standing off and on.</p><p>At <time>two o'clock  in the morning</time> of the 19th, having made sail, we steered S.E. by E. along the
coast, and soon passed the S.E. point of the bay of St Barbara, which I called Cape Desolation,
because near it commenced the most desolate and barren country I ever saw. It is situated in the
latitude of <geo select="lat">54° 55' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">72° 12' W</geo>. About four leagues to the east of this cape is a deep
inlet, at the entrance of which lies a pretty large island, and some others of less note. Nearly in
this situation some charts place a channel leading into the straits of Magalhaens, under the name of
straits of Jelouzel. At <time>ten o'clock</time>, being about a league and a half from the land, we sounded, and
found sixty fathoms water, a bottom of small stones and shells.</p><p>The wind, which had been fresh at N. by W., began to abate, and at <time>noon</time> it fell calm, when we
observed in latitude <geo select="lat">55° 20' S</geo>., longitude made from Cape Deseada <geo select="lon">3° 24' E</geo>. In this situation we
were about three leagues from the nearest shore, which was that of an island. This I named Gilbert
Isle, after my master. It is nearly of the same height with the rest of the coast, and shews a
surface composed of several peaked rocks unequally high. A little to the S.E. of it are some smaller
islands, and, without them, breakers.</p><p>I have before observed that this is the most desolate coast I ever saw. It seems entirely
composed of rocky mountains without the least appearance of vegetation. These mountains terminate in
horrible precipices, whose craggy summits spire up to a vast height, so that hardly any thing in
nature can appear with a more barren and savage aspect than the whole of this country. The inland
mountains were covered with snow, but those on the sea-coast were not. We judged the former to
belong to the main of Terra del Fuego, and the latter to be islands, so ranged as apparently to form
a coast.</p><p>After three hours calm we got a breeze at S.E. by E., and having made a short trip to south,
stood in for the land; the most advanced point of which, that we had in sight, bore east, distant
ten leagues. This is a lofty promontory, lying E.S.E, nineteen leagues from Gilbert isle, and
situated in latitude <geo select="lat">55° 26' S</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon">70° 25' W</geo>. Viewed from the situation we now were in, it
terminated in two high towers; and, within them, a hill shaped like a sugar-loaf. This wild rock,
therefore, obtained the name of York Minster. Two leagues to the westward of this head appeared a
large inlet, the west point of which we fetched in with by <time>nine o'clock</time>, when we tacked in forty-one
fathoms water, half a league from the shore; to the westward of this inlet was another, with several
islands lying in the entrance.</p><p>During the night between the 19th and 20th we had little wind easterly, which in the morning
veered to N.E. and N.N.E., but it was too faint to be of use; and at ten we had a calm, when we
observed the ship to drive from off the shore out to sea. We had made the same observation the day
before. This must have been occasioned by a current; and the melting of the snow increasing, the
inland waters will cause a stream to run out of most of these inlets. At <time>noon</time> we observed in
latitude <geo select="lat">55° 39' 30" S</geo>., York Minster then bearing N. 15° E., distant five leagues; and Round-hill,
just peeping above the horizon, which we judged to belong to the isles of St Ildefonso, E. 25° S.,
ten or eleven leagues distant. At <time>ten o'clock</time>, a breeze springing up at E. by S., I took this
opportunity to stand in for the land, being desirous of going into one of the many ports which
seemed open to receive us, in order to take a view of the country, and to recruit our stock of wood
and water.</p><p>In standing in for an opening, which appeared on the east side of York Minster, we had forty,
thirty-seven, fifty, and sixty fathoms water, a bottom of small stones and shells. When we had the
last soundings, we were nearly in the middle between the two points that form the entrance to the
inlet, which we observed to branch into two arms, both of them lying in nearly north, and disjoined
by an high rocky point. We stood for the eastern branch as being clear of islets; and after passing
a black rocky one, lying without the point just mentioned, we sounded, and found no bottom with a
line of an hundred and seventy fathoms. This was altogether unexpected, and a circumstance that
would not have been regarded if the breeze had continued; but at this time it fell calm, so that it
was not possible to extricate ourselves from this disagreeable situation. Two boats were hoisted
out, and sent a-head to tow; but they would have availed little, had not a breeze sprung up about
<time>eight o'clock</time> at S.W., which put it in my power either to stand out to sea, or up the inlet.
Prudence seemed to point out the former, but the desire of finding a good port, and of learning
something of the country, getting the better of every other consideration, I resolved to stand in;
and, as night was approaching, our safety depended on getting to an anchor. With this view we
continued to sound, but always had an unfathomable depth.</p><p>Hauling up under the east side of the land which divided the two arms, and seeing a small cove
ahead, I sent a boat to sound; and we kept as near the shore as the flurries from the land would
permit, in order to be able to get into this place, if there should be anchorage. The boat soon
returned, and informed us that there was thirty and twenty-five fathoms water, a full cable's length
from the shore; here we anchored in thirty fathoms, the bottom sand and broken shells; and carried
out a kedge and hawser to steady the ship for the night.</p></div><div type="chapter"><head><l>CHAPTER II.</l><l><emph>Transactions in Christmas Sound, with an Account of the Country and its
Inhabitants.</emph></l></head><p><date>1774 December</date></p><p>The morning of the 21st was calm and pleasant. After breakfast I set out with two boats to look
for a more secure station. We no sooner got round, or above the point, under which the ship lay,
than we found a cove in which was anchorage in thirty, twenty, and fifteen fathoms, the bottom
stones and sand. At the head of the cove was a stony beach, a valley covered with wood, and a stream
of fresh water, so that there was every thing we could expect to find in such a place, or rather
more; for we shot three geese out of four that we saw, and caught some young ones, which we
afterwards let go.</p><p>After discovering and sounding this cove, I sent Lieutenant Clerke, who commanded the other boat,
on board, with orders to remove the ship into this place, while I proceeded farther up the inlet. I
presently saw that the land we were under, which disjoined the two arms, as mentioned before, was an
island, at the north end of which the two channels united. After this I hastened on board, and found
every thing in readiness to weigh, which was accordingly done, and all the boats sent ahead to tow
the ship round the point. But at that moment a light breeze came in from the sea too scant to fill
our sails, so that we were obliged to drop the anchor again, for fear of falling upon the point, and
to carry out a kedge to windward. That being done, we hove up the anchor, warped up to, and weighed
the kedge, and proceeding round the point under our stay-sails; there anchored with the best bower
in twenty fathoms; and moored with the other bower, which lay to the north, in thirteen fathoms. In
this position we were shut in from the sea by the point above-mentioned, which was in one with the
extremity of the inlet to the east. Some islets, off the next point above us, covered us from the
N.W., from which quarter the wind had the greatest fetch, and our distance from the shore was about
one-third of a mile.</p><p>Thus situated we went to work, to clear a place to fill water, to cut wood, and to set up a tent
for the reception of a guard, which was thought necessary, as we had already discovered that, barren
as this country is, it was not without people, though we had not yet seen any. Mr Wales also got his
observatory and instruments on shore; but it was with the greatest difficulty he could find a place
of sufficient stability, and clear of the mountains, which every where surrounded us, to set them up
in; and at last he was obliged to content himself with the top of a rock not more than nine feet
over.</p><p>Next day I sent Lieutenants Clerke and Pickersgill, accompanied by some of the other officers, to
examine and draw a sketch of the channel on the other side of the island; and I went myself in
another boat, accompanied by the botanists, to survey the northern parts of the sound. In my way I
landed on the point of a low isle covered with herbage, part of which had been lately burnt: We
likewise saw a hut, signs sufficient that people were in the neighbourhood. After I had taken the
necessary bearings, we proceeded round the east end of Burnt Island, and over to what we judged to
be the main of Terra del Fuego, where we found a very fine harbour encompassed by steep rocks of
vast height, down which ran many limpid streams of water; and at the foot of the rocks some tufts of
trees, fit for little else but fuel.</p><p>This harbour, which I shall distinguish by the name of the Devil's Bason, is divided, as it were,
into two, an inner and an outer one; and the communication between them is by a narrow channel five
fathoms deep. In the outer bason I found thirteen and seventeen fathoms water, and in the inner
seventeen and twenty-three. This last is as secure a place as can be, but nothing can be more
gloomy. The vast height of the savage rocks which encompass it, deprived great part of it, even on
this day, of the meridian sun. The outer harbour is not quite free from this inconvenience, but far
more so than the other; it is also rather more commodious, and equally safe. It lies in the
direction of north, a mile and a half distant from the east end of Burnt Island. I likewise found a
good anchoring-place a little to the west of this harbour, before a stream of water, that comes out
of a lake or large reservoir, which is continually supplied by a cascade falling into it.</p><p>Leaving this place, we proceeded along the shore to the westward, and found other harbours which
I had not time to look into. In all of them is fresh water, and wood for fuel; but, except these
little tufts of bushes, the whole country is a barren rock, doomed by nature to everlasting
sterility. The low islands, and even some of the higher, which lie scattered up and down the sound,
are indeed mostly covered with shrubs and herbage, the soil a black rotten turf, evidently composed,
by length of time, of decayed vegetables.</p><p>I had an opportunity to verify what we had observed at sea, that the sea-coast is composed of a
number of large and small islands, and that the numerous inlets are formed by the junction of
several channels; at least so it is here. On one of these low islands we found several huts, which
had lately been inhabited; and near them was a good deal of celery, with which we loaded our boat,
and returned on board at <time>seven o'clock  in the evening</time>. In this expedition we met with little game;
one duck, three or four shags, and about that number of rails or sea-pies, being all we got. The
other boat returned on board some hours before, having found two harbours on the west side of the
other channel; the one large, and the other small, but both of them safe and commodious; though, by
the sketch Mr Pickersgill had taken of them, the access to both appeared rather intricate.</p><p>I was now told of a melancholy accident which had befallen one of our marines. He had not been
seen since eleven or <time>twelve o'clock</time> the preceding night. It was supposed that he had fallen
overboard, out of the head, where he had been last seen, and was drowned.</p><p>Having fine pleasant weather on the 23d, I sent Lieutenant Pickersgill in the cutter to explore
the east side of the sound, and went myself in the pinnace to the west side, with an intent to go
round the island, under which we were at anchor (and which I shall distinguish by the name of Shag
Island), in order to view the passage leading to the harbours Mr Pickersgill had discovered the day
before, on which I made the following observations. In coming from sea, leave all the rocks and
islands, lying off and within York Minster, on your larboard side; and the black rock, which lies
off the south end of Shag Island, on your starboard; and when abreast of the south end of that
island, haul over for the west shore, taking care to avoid the beds of weeds you will see before
you, as they always grow on rocks; some of which I have found twelve fathoms under water; but it is
always best to keep clear of them. The entrance to the large harbour, or Port Clerke, is just to the
north of some low rocks lying off a point on Shag Island. This harbour lies in W. by S., a mile and
a half, and hath in it from twelve to twenty-four fathoms depth, wood and fresh water. About a mile
without, or to the southward of Port Clerke, is, or seemed to be, another which I did not examine.
It is formed by a large island which covers it from the south and east winds. Without this island,
that is, between it and York Minster, the sea seemed strewed with islets, rocks, and breakers. In
proceeding round the south end of Shag Island, we observed the shags to breed in vast numbers in the
cliffs of the rock. Some of the old ones we shot, but could not come at the young ones, which are by
far the best eating. On the east side of the island we saw some geese; and having with difficulty
landed, we killed three, which, at this time, was a valuable acquisition.</p><p>About seven, in the evening, we got on board, where Mr Pickersgill had arrived but just before.
He informed me that the land opposite to our station was an island, which he had been round; that on
another, more to the north, be found many <emph>terns</emph> eggs; and that without the great
island, between it and the east-head, lay a cove in which were many geese; one only of which he got,
beside some young goslings.</p><p>This information of Mr Pickersgill's induced me to make up two shooting parties next day; Mr
Pickersgill and his associates going in the cutter, and myself and the botanists in the pinnace. Mr
Pickersgill went by the N.E. side of the large island above-mentioned, which obtained the name of
Goose Island; and I went by the S.W. side. As soon as we got under the island we found plenty of
shags in the cliffs, but, without staying to spend our time and shot upon these, we proceeded on,
and presently found sport enough, for in the south side of the island were abundance of geese. It
happened to be the moulting season; and most of them were on shore for that purpose, and could not
fly. There being a great surf, we found great difficulty in landing, and very bad climbing over the
rocks when we were landed; so that hundreds of the geese escaped us, some into the sea, and others
up into the island. We, however, by one means or other, got sixty-two, with which we returned on
board all heartily tired; but the acquisition we had made overbalanced every other consideration,
and we sat down with a good appetite to supper on part of what the preceding day had produced. Mr
Pickersgill and his associates had got on board some time before us with fourteen geese; so that I
was able to make distribution to the whole crew, which was the more acceptable on account of the
approaching festival. For had not Providence thus singularly provided for us, our Christmas cheer
must have been salt beef and pork.</p><p>I now learnt that a number of the natives, in nine canoes, had been alongside the ship, and some
on board. Little address was required to persuade them to either; for they seemed to be well enough
acquainted with Europeans, and had, amongst them, some of their knives.</p><p>The next morning, the 25th, they made us another visit. I found them to be of the same nation I
had formerly seen in Success Bay, and the same which M. de Bougainville distinguishes by the name of
Pecheras; a word which these had, on every occasion, in their mouths. They are a little, ugly,
half-starved, beardless race. I saw not a tall person amongst them. They are almost naked; their
clothing was a seal-skin; some had two or three sewed together, so as to make a cloak which reached
to the knees; but the most of them had only one skin, hardly large enough to cover their shoulders,
and all their lower parts were quite naked. The women, I was told, cover their nakedness with the
flap of a seal-skin, but in other respects are clothed like the men. They, as well as the children,
remained in the canoes. I saw two young children at the breast entirely naked; thus they are inured
from their infancy to cold and hardships. They had with them bows and arrows, and darts, or rather
harpoons, made of bone, and fitted to a staff. I suppose they were intended to kill seals and fish;
they may also kill whales with them, as the Esquimaux do. I know not if they resemble them in their
love of train-oil; but they and every thing they had smelt most intolerably of it. I ordered them
some biscuit, but did not observe them so fond of it as I had been told. They were much better
pleased when I gave them some medals, knives, etc.</p><p>The women and children, as before observed, remained in their canoes. These were made of bark;
and in each was a fire, over which the poor creatures huddled themselves. I cannot suppose that they
carry a fire in their canoes for this purpose only, but rather that it may be always ready to remove
ashore wherever they land; for let their method of obtaining fire be what it may, they cannot be
always sure of finding dry fuel that will kindle from a spark. They likewise carry in their canoes
large seal hides, which I judged were to shelter them when at sea, and to serve as covering to their
huts on shore, and occasionally to be used for sails.</p><p>They all retired before dinner, and did not wait to partake of our Christmas cheer. Indeed I
believe no one invited them, and for good reasons; for their dirty persons, and the stench they
carried about them, were enough to spoil the appetite of any European; and that would have been a
real disappointment, as we had not experienced such fare for some time. Roast and boiled geese,
goose-pye, etc. was a treat little known to us; and we had yet some Madeira wine left, which was the
only article of our provision that was mended by keeping. So that our friends in England did not,
perhaps, celebrate Christmas more cheerfully than we did.</p><p>On the 26th, little wind next to a calm, and fair weather, except in the morning, when we had
some showers of rain. In the evening, when it was cold, the natives made us another visit; and it
being distressing to see them stand trembling and naked on the deck, I could not do less than give
them some baize and old canvas to cover themselves.</p><p>Having already completed our water, on the 27th I ordered the wood, tent, and observatory to be
got on board; and, as this was work for the day, a party of us went in two boats to shoot geese, the
weather being fine and pleasant. We proceeded round by the south side of Goose Island, and picked up
in all thirty-one. On the east side of the island, to the north of the east point, is good
anchorage, in seventeen fathoms water, where it is entirely land-locked. This is a good place for
ships to lie in that are bound to the west. On the north side of this isle I observed three fine
coves, in which were both wood and water; but it being near night, I had no time to sound them,
though I doubt not there is anchorage. The way to come at them is by the west end of the island.</p><p>When I returned on board I found every thing got off the shore, and the launch in; so that we now
only waited for a wind to put to sea. The festival, which we celebrated at this place, occasioned my
giving it the name of Christmas Sound. The entrance, which is three leagues wide, is situated in the
latitude of <geo select="lat">55° 27' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">70° 16' W</geo>.; and in the direction of N. 37° W. from St Ildefonso
Isles, distant ten leagues. These isles are the best landmark for finding the sound. York Minster,
which is the only remarkable land about it, will hardly be known by a stranger, from any description
that can be given of it, because it alters its appearance according to the different situations it
is viewed from. Besides the black rock, which lies off the end of Shag Island, there is another
about midway between this and the east shore. A copious description of this sound is unnecessary, as
few would be benefited by it. Anchorage, tufts of wood, and fresh-water, will be found in all the
coves and harbours. I would advise no one to anchor very near the shore for the sake of having a
moderate depth of water, because there I generally found a rocky bottom.</p><p>The refreshments to be got here are precarious, as they consist chiefly of wild fowl, and may
probably never be found in such plenty as to supply the crew of a ship; and fish, so far as we can
judge, are scarce. Indeed the plenty of wild-fowl made us pay less attention to fishing. Here are,
however, plenty of muscles, not very large, but well tasted; and very good celery is to be met with
on several of the low islets, and where the natives have their habitations. The wild-fowl are geese,
ducks, sea-pies, shags, and that kind of gull so often mentioned in this journal under the name of
Port Egmont hen. Here is a kind of duck, called by our people race-horses, on account of the great
swiftness with which they run on the water; for they cannot fly, the wings being too short to
support the body in the air. This bird is at the Falkland Islands, as appears by Pernety's Journal*.
The geese too are there, and seem to be very well described under the name of bustards. They are
much smaller than our English tame geese, but eat as well as any I ever tasted. They have short
black bills and yellow feet. The gander is all white; the female is spotted black and white, or
grey, with a large white spot on each wing. Besides the bird above-mentioned, here are several other
aquatic, and some land ones; but of the latter not many.</p><p>[* See Pernety's Journal, p.244 and p.213.]</p><p>From the knowledge which the inhabitants seem to have of Europeans, we may suppose that they do
not live here continually, but retire to the north during the winter. I have often wondered that
these people do not clothe themselves better, since Nature has certainly provided materials. They
might line their seal-skin cloaks with the skins and feathers of aquatic birds; they might make
their cloaks larger, and employ the same skins for other parts of clothing, for I cannot suppose
they are scarce with them. They were ready enough to part with those they had to our people, which
they hardly would have done, had they not known where to have got more. In short, of all the nations
I have seen, the Pecheras are the most wretched. They are doomed to live in one of the most
inhospitable climates in the world, without having sagacity enough to provide themselves with such
conveniences as may render life in some measure more comfortable.</p><p>Barren as this country is, it abounds with a variety of unknown plants, and gave sufficient
employment to Mr Forster and his party. The tree, which produceth the winter's bark; is found here
in the woods, as is the holy-leaved barberry; and some other sorts, which I know not, but I believe
are common in the straits of Magalhaens. We found plenty of a berry, which we called the cranberry,
because they are nearly of the same colour, size, and shape. It grows on a bushy plant, has a
bitterish taste, rather insipid; but may he eaten either raw or in tarts, and is used as food by the
natives.</p></div><div type="chapter"><head><l>CHAPTER III. </l><l><emph>Range from Christmas Sound, round Cape Horn, through Strait Le Maire, and round Staten
Land; with an Account of the Discovery of a Harbour in that Island, and a Description of the
Coasts.</emph></l></head><p><date>1774 December</date></p><p>At <time>four o'clock  in the morning</time> on the 28th, we began to unmoor, and at eight weighed, and stood
out to sea, with a light breeze at N.W., which afterwards freshened, and was attended with rain. At
<time>noon</time>, the east point of the sound (Point Nativity) bore N. 1/2 W., distant one and a half leagues,
and St Ildefonzo Isles S.E. 1/2 S., distant seven leagues. The coast seemed to trend in the
direction of E. by S.; but the weather being very hazy, nothing appeared distinct.</p><p>We continued to steer S.E. by E. and E.S.E.; with a fresh breeze at W.N.W., till <time>four o'clock</time>
p.m., when we hauled to the south, in order to have a nearer view of St Ildefonzo Isles. At this
time we were abreast of an inlet, which lies E.S.E, about seven leagues from the sound; but it must
be observed that there are some isles without this distinction. At the west point of the inlet are
two high peaked hills, and below them, to the east, two round hills, or isles, which lie in the
direction of N.E. and S.W. of each other. An island, or what appeared to be an island, lay in the
entrance; and another but smaller inlet appeared to the west of this: Indeed the coast appeared
indented and broken as usual.</p><p>At half past <time>five o'clock</time>, the weather clearing up, gave us a good sight of Ildefonzo Isles. They
are a group of islands and rocks above water, situated about six leagues from the main, and in the
latitude of <geo select="lat">55° 53' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">69° 41' W</geo>.</p><p>We now resumed our course to the east, and, at sun-set, the most advanced land bore S.E. by E.
3/4 E.; and a point, which I judged to be the west point of Nassau Bay, discovered by the Dutch
fleet under the command of Admiral Hermite in 1624, bore N. 80° E., six leagues distant. In some
charts this point is called False Cape Horn, as being the southern point of Terra del Fuego. It is
situated in latitude <geo select="lat">55° 39' S</geo>. From the inlet above-mentioned to this false cape, the direction of
the coast is nearly east, half a point south, distant fourteen or fifteen leagues.</p><p>At <time>ten o'clock</time>, having shortened sail, we spent the night in making short boards under the
top-sails, and at three next morning made sail, and steered S.E. by S., with a fresh breeze at
W.S.W., the weather somewhat hazy. At this time the west entrance to Nassau Bay extended from N. by
E. to N.E. 1/2 E., and the south side of Hermite's Isles, E. by S. At four, Cape Horn, for which we
now steered, bore E. by S. It is known, at a distance, by a high round hill over it. A point to the
W.N.W. shews a surface not unlike this; but their situations alone will always distinguish the one
from the other.</p><p>At half past seven, we passed this famous <emph>cape</emph>, and entered the southern Atlantic
ocean. It is the very same point of land I took for the cape, when I passed it in 1769, which at
that time I was doubtful of. It is the most southern extremity on a group of islands of unequal
extent, lying before Nassau Bay, known by the name of Hermite Islands, and is situated in the
latitude of <geo select="lat">55° 58' S</geo> , and in the longitude of <geo select="lon">68° 13' W</geo>.; according to the observations made of it in
1769. But the observations which we had in Christmas Sound, and reduced to the cape by the watch,
and others which we had afterwards, and reduced back to it by the same means, place it in 67° 19'.
It is most probable that a mean between the two, viz. 67° 46', will be nearest the truth. On the
N.W. side of the cape are two peaked rocks, like sugar-loaves: They lie N.W. by N., and S.E. by S.,
by compass, of each other. Some other straggling low rocks lie west of the cape, and one south of
it; but they are all near the shore. From Christmas Sound to Cape Horn the course is E.S.E 1/4 E.,
distant thirty-one leagues. In the direction of E.N.E., three leagues from Cape Horn, is a rocky
point, which I called Mistaken Cape, and is the southern point of the easternmost of Hermite Isles.
Between these two capes there seemed to be a passage directly into Nassau Bay; some small isles were
seen in the passage; and the coast, on the west side, had the appearance of forming good bays or
harbours. In some charts, Cape Horn is laid down as belonging to a small island. This was neither
confirmed, nor can it be contradicted by us; for several breakers appeared on the coast, both to the
east and west of it; and the hazy weather rendered every object indistinct. The summits of some of
the hills were rocky, but the sides and vallies seemed covered with a green turf, and wooded in
tufts.</p><p>From Cape Horn we steered E. by N. 1/2 N., which direction carried us without the rocks that lie
off Mistaken Cape. These rocks are white with the dung of fowls, and vast numbers were seen about
them. After passing them we steered N.E. 1/2 E. and N.E., for Strait Le Maire, with a view of
looking into Success Bay, to see if there were any traces of the Adventure having been there. At
<time>eight o'clock  in the evening</time>, drawing near the strait, we shortened sail, and hauled the wind. At
this time the Sugar-loaf on Terra del Fuego bore N. 33° W.; the point of Success Bay, just open of
the cape of the same name, bearing N. 20° E.; and Staten Land, extending from N. 53° E. to <geo select="lon">67° E</geo>.
Soon after the wind died away, and we had light airs and calms by turns till near <time>noon</time> the next day,
during which time we were driven by the current over to Staten Land.</p><p>The calm being succeeded by a light breeze at N.N.W., we stood over for Success Bay, assisted by
the currents, which set to the north. Before this we had hoisted our colours, and fired two guns;
and soon after saw a smoke rise out of the woods, above the south point of the bay, which I judged
was made by the natives, as it was at the place where they resided when I was here in 1769. As soon
as we got off the bay, I sent Lieutenant Pickersgill to see if any traces remained of the Adventure
having been there lately; and in the mean time we stood on and off with the ship. At <time>two o'clock</time>,
the current turned and set to the south; and Mr Pickersgill informed me, when he returned, that it
was falling water on shore, which was contrary to what I had observed when I was here before, for I
thought then that the flood came from the north. Mr Pickersgill saw not the least signs of any ship
having been there lately. I had inscribed our ship's name on a card, which he nailed to a tree at
the place where the Endeavour watered. This was done with a view of giving Captain Furneaux some
information, in case he should be behind us and put in here.</p><p>On Mr Pickersgill's landing he was courteously received by several of the natives, who were
clothed in guanicoe and seal skins, and had on their arms bracelets, made of silver wire, and
wrought not unlike the hilt of a sword, being no doubt the manufacture of some Europeans. They were
the same kind of people we had seen in Christmas Sound, and, like them, repeated the word pechera on
every occasion. One man spoke much to Mr Pickersgill, pointing first to the ship and then to the
bay, as if he wanted her to come in. Mr Pickersgill said the bay was full of whales and seals; and
we had observed the same in the strait, especially on the Terra del Fuego side, where the whales, in
particular, are exceedingly numerous.</p><p>As soon as the boat was hoisted in, which, was not till near <time>six o'clock</time>, we made sail to the
east, with a fine breeze at north. For since we had explored the south coast of Terra del Fuego, I
resolved to do the same by Staten Land, which I believed to have been as little known as the former.
At <time>nine o'clock</time> the wind freshening, and veering to N.W., we tacked, and stood to S.W., in order to
spend the night; which proved none of the best, being stormy and hazy, with rain.</p><p>Next morning, at <time>three o'clock</time>, we bore up for the east end of Staten Land, which, at half past
four, bore S. 60° E., the west end S. 2° E., and the land of Terra del Fuego S. 40° W. Soon after I
had taken these bearings, the land was again obscured in a thick haze, and we were obliged to make
way, as it were, in the dark; for it was but now and then we got a sight of the coast. As we
advanced to the east, we perceived several islands, of unequal extent, lying off the land. There
seemed to be a clear passage between the easternmost, and the one next to it, to the west. I would
gladly have gone through this passage, and anchored under one of the islands, to have waited for
better weather, for on sounding we found only twenty-nine fathoms water; but when I considered that
this was running to leeward in the dark, I chose to keep without the islands, and accordingly hauled
off to the north. At <time>eight o'clock</time> we were abreast of the most eastern isle, distant from it about
two miles, and had the same depth of water as before. I now shortened sail to the three top-sails,
to wait for clear weather; for the fog was so thick that we could see no other land than this
island. After waiting an hour, and the weather not clearing, we bore up and hauled round the east
end of the island, for the sake of smooth water and anchorage, if it should be necessary. In hauling
round, we found a strong race of a current, like unto broken water; but we had no less than nineteen
fathoms. We also saw on the island abundance of seals and birds. This was a temptation too great for
people in our situation to withstand, to whom fresh provisions of any kind were acceptable; and
determined me to anchor, in order that we might taste of what we now only saw at a distance. At
length, after making a few boards, fishing, as it were, for the best ground, we anchored in
twenty-one fathoms water, a stony bottom, about a mile from the island, which extended from N. 18°
E. to N. 55.5° W.; and soon after, the weather clearing up, we saw Cape St John, or the east end
of Staten Land, bearing S. 76° E., distant four leagues. We were sheltered from the south wind by
Staten Land, and from the north wind by the island; the other isles lay to the west, and secured us
from that wind; but beside being open to the N.E. and E., we also lay exposed to the N.N.W. winds.
This might have been avoided by anchoring more to the west, but I made choice of my situation for
two reasons; first, to be near the island we intended to land upon, and, secondly, to be able to get
to sea with any wind.</p><p>After dinner we hoisted out three boats, and landed with a large party of men; some to kill
seals, others to catch or kill birds, fish, or what came in our way. To find the former it mattered
not where we landed, for the whole shore was covered with them; and by the noise they made one would
have thought the island was stocked with cows and calves. On landing we found they were a different
animal from seals, but in shape and motion exactly resembling them. We called them lions, on account
of the great resemblance the male has to that beast. Here were also the same kind of seals which we
found in New Zealand, generally known by the name of sea-bears; at least we gave them that name.</p><p>They were, in general, so tame, or rather stupid, as to suffer us to come near enough to knock
them down with sticks; but the large ones we shot, not thinking it safe to approach them. We also
found on the island abundance of penguins and shags; and the latter had young ones almost fledged,
and just to our taste. Here were geese and ducks, but not many; birds of prey, and a few small
birds. In the evening we returned on board, our boats well laden with one thing or other.</p><p><date>1775 January</date></p><p>Next day, being <date>January the 1st, 1775</date>, finding that nothing was wanting but a good harbour to
make this a tolerable place for ships to refresh at, whom chance or design, might bring hither, I
sent Mr Gilbert over to Staten Land in the cutter to look for one. Appearances promised success in a
place opposite the ship. I also sent two other boats for the lions, etc. we had killed the preceding
day; and soon after I went myself, and observed the sun's meridian altitude at the N.E. end of the
island, which gave the latitude <geo select="lat">54° 40' 5" S</geo>. After shooting a few geese, some other birds, and
plentifully supplying ourselves with young shags, we returned on board, laden with sea-lions,
sea-bears, etc. The old lions and bears were killed chiefly for the sake of their blubber, or fat,
to make oil of; for, except their haslets, which were tolerable, the flesh was too rank to be eaten
with any degree of relish. But the young cubs were very palateable, and even the flesh of some of
the old lionesses was not much amiss, but that of the old males was abominable. In the <time>afternoon</time> I
sent some people on shore to skin and cut off the fat of those which yet remained dead on shore, for
we had already more carcases on board than necessary; and I went myself, in another boat, to collect
birds. About <time>ten o'clock</time> Mr Gilbert returned from Staten Land, where he found a good port, situated
three leagues to the westward of Cape St John, and in the direction of north, a little easterly,
from the N.E. end of the eastern island. It may be known by some small islands lying in the
entrance. The channel, which is on the east side of these islands, is half a mile broad. The course
is in S.W. by S., turning gradually to W. by S. and W. The harbour lies nearly in this last
direction; is almost two miles in length; in some places near a mile broad; and hath in it from
fifty to ten fathoms water, a bottom of mud and sand. Its shores are covered with wood fit for fuel;
and in it are several streams of fresh water. On the islands were sea-lions, etc. and such an
innumerable quantity of gulls as to darken the air when disturbed, and almost to suffocate our
people with their dung. This they seemed to void in a way of defence, and it stunk worse than
assafoetida, or what is commonly called devil's dung. Our people saw several geese, ducks, and
race-horses, which is also a kind of duck. The day on which this port was discovered occasioned my
calling it New-Year's Harbour. It would be more convenient for ships bound to the west, or round
Cape Horn, if its situation would permit them to put to sea with an easterly and northerly wind.
This inconvenience, however, is of little consequence, since these winds are never known to be of
long duration. The southerly and westerly are the prevailing winds, so that a ship never can be
detained long in this port.</p><p>As we could not sail in the morning of the 2d for want of wind, I sent a party of men on shore to
the island, on the same duty as before. Towards <time>noon</time> we got a fresh breeze at west; but it came too
late, and I resolved to wait till the next morning, when, at <time>four o'clock</time>, we weighed, with a fresh
gale at N.W. by W., and stood for Cape St John, which, at half past six, bore N. by E., distant four
or five miles. This cape, being the eastern point of Staten Land, a description of it is
unnecessary. It may, however, not be amiss to say, that it is a rock of a considerable height,
situated in the latitude of <geo select="lat">54° 46' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">63° 47' W</geo>., with a rocky islet lying close under
the north part of it. To the westward of the cape, about five or six miles, is an inlet, which
seemed to divide the land, that is, to communicate with the sea to the south; and between this inlet
and the cape is a bay, but I cannot say of what depth. In sailing round the cape we met with a very
strong current from the south: It made a race which looked like breakers; and it was as much as we
could do, with a strong gale, to make head against it.</p><p>After getting round the cape, I hauled up along the south coast, and as soon as we had brought
the wind to blow off the land, it came upon us in such heavy squalls as obliged us to double-reef
our top-sails. It afterwards fell, by little and little, and at <time>noon</time> ended in a calm. At this time
Cape St John bore N. 20° E., distant three and a half leagues; Cape St Bartholomew, or the S.W.
point of Staten Land, S. 83° W.; two high detached rocks N. 80° W.; and the place where the land
seemed to be divided, which had the same appearance on this side, bore N. 15° W. three leagues
distant. Latitude observed 54° 56'. In this situation we sounded, but had no bottom with a line of
120 fathoms. The calm was of very short duration, a breeze presently springing up at N.W.; but it
was too faint to make head against the current, and we drove with it back to the N.N.E. At four
o'clock the wind veered, at once, to S. by E., and blew in squalls attended with rain. Two hours
after, the squalls and rain subsided, and the wind returning back to the west, blew a gentle gale.
All this time the current set us to the north, so that, at <time>eight o'clock</time>, Cape St John bore W.N.W.,
distant about seven leagues. I now gave over plying, and steered S.E., with a resolution to leave
the land; judging it to be sufficiently explored to answer the most general purposes of navigation
and geography.</p></div><div type="chapter"><head><l>CHAPTER IV.</l><l><emph>Observations, geographical and nautical, with an Account of the Islands near Staten Land,
and the Animals found in them</emph>.</l></head><p><date>1775 January</date></p><p>The annexed chart will very accurately shew the direction, extent, and position of the coast,
along which I have sailed, either in this or my former voyage. The latitudes have been determined by
the sun's meridian altitude, which we were so fortunate as to obtain every day, except the one we
sailed from Christmas Sound, which was of no consequence, as its latitude was known before. The
longitudes have been settled by lunar observations, as is already mentioned. I have taken 67° 46'
for the longitude of Cape Horn. From this meridian the longitudes of all the other parts are deduced
by the watch, by which the extent of the whole mast be determined to a few miles; and whatever
errors there may be in longitude, must be general. But I think it highly probable that the longitude
is determined to within a quarter of a degree. Thus the extent of Terra del Fuego from east to west,
and consequently that of the straits of Magalhaens, will be found less than most navigators have
made it.</p><p>In order to illustrate this and to shew the situations of the neighbouring lands, and, by this
means, make the chart of more general use, I have extended it down to 47° of latitude. But I am only
answerable for the accuracy of such parts as I have explored myself. In laying down the rest I had
recourse to the following authorities.</p><p>The longitude of Cape Virgin Mary, which is the most essential point, as it determines the length
of the straits of Magalhaens, is deduced from Lord Anson, who made 2° 30' difference of longitude
between it and the Strait Le Maire. Now as the latter lies in 65° 22', Cape Virgin-Mary must lie in:
67° 52', which is the longitude I have assigned to it, and which, I have reason to think, cannot be
far from the truth.</p><p>The strait of Magalhaens, and the east coast of Patagonia, are laid down from the observations
made by the late English and French navigators.</p><p>The position of the west coast of America, from Cape Victory northward, I have taken from the
discoveries of <emph>Sarmiento</emph>, a Spanish navigator, communicated to me by Mr Stuart,
F.R.S.</p><p>Falkland Islands are copied from a sketch taken from Captain M'Bride, who circumnavigated them
some years ago in his majesty's ship Jason; and their distance from the main is agreeable to the run
of the Dolphin, under the command of Commodore Byron, from Cape Virgin Mary to Port Egmont, and from
Port Egmont to Port Desire, both of which runs were made in a few days; consequently no material
errors could happen.</p><p>The S.W. coast of Terra del Fuego, with respect to inlets, islands, etc. may be compared to the
coast of Norway; for I doubt if there be an extent of three leagues where there is not an inlet or
harbour which will receive and shelter the largest shipping. The worst is, that till these inlets
are better known, one has, as it were, to fish for anchorage. There are several lurking rocks on the
coast, but happily none of them lie far from land, the approach to which may be known by sounding,
supposing the weather so obscure that you cannot see it. For to judge of the whole by the parts we
have sounded, it is more than probable that there are soundings all along the coast, and for several
leagues out to sea. Upon the whole, this is by no means the dangerous coast it has been
represented.</p><p>Staten Land lies near E. by N. and W. by S., and is ten leagues long in that direction, and no
where above three or four leagues broad. The coast is rocky, much indented, and seemed to form
several bays or inlets. It shews a surface of craggy hills which spire up to a vast height,
especially near the west end. Except the craggy summits of the hills, the greatest part was covered
with trees and shrubs, or some sort of herbage, and there was little or no snow on it. The currents
between Cape Deseada and Cape Horn set from west to east, that is, in the same direction as the
coast; but they are by no means considerable. To the east of the cape their strength is much
increased, and their direction is N.E. towards Staten Land. They are rapid in Strait Le Maire and
along the south coast of Staten Land, and set like a torrent round Cape St John; where they take a
N.W. direction, and continue to run very strong both within and without New Year's Isles. While we
lay at anchor within this island, I observed that the current was strongest during the flood; and
that on the ebb its strength was so much impaired, that the ship would sometimes ride head to the
wind when it was at W. and W.N.W. This is only to be understood of the place where the ship lay at
anchor, for at the very time we had a strong current setting to the westward, Mr Gilbert found one
of equal strength near the coast of Staten Land setting to the eastward, though probably this was an
eddy current or tide.</p><p>If the tides are regulated by the moon, it is high-water by the shore at this place on the days
of the new and full moon, about <time>four o'clock</time>. The perpendicular rise and fall is very
inconsiderable, not exceeding four feet at most. In Christmas Sound it is high-water at half past
<time>two o'clock</time> on the days of the full and change, and Mr Wales observed it to rise and fall on a
perpendicular three feet six inches; but this was during the neap tides, consequently the spring
tides must rise higher. To give such an account of the tides and currents on these coasts as
navigators might depend on, would require a multitude of observations, and in different places, the
making of which would be a work of time. I confess myself unprovided with materials for such a task;
and believe that the less I say on this subject the fewer mistakes I shall make. But I think I have
been able to observe, that in Strait Le Maire the southerly tide or current, be it flood or ebb,
begins to act on the days of new and full moon about <time>four o'clock</time>, which remark may be of use to
ships who pass the strait.</p><p>Were I bound round Cape Horn to the west, and not in want of wood or water, or any other thing
that might make it necessary to put into port, I would not come near the land at all. For by keeping
out at sea you avoid the currents, which, I am satisfied, lose their force at ten or twelve leagues
from land; and at a greater distance, there is none.</p><p>During the time we were upon the coast we had more calms than storms, and the winds so variable,
that I question if a passage might not have been made from east to west in as short a time as from
west to east; nor did we experience any cold weather. The mercury in the thermometer at <time>noon</time> was
never below 46°; and while we lay in Christmas Sound it was generally above temperate. At this place
the variation was 23° 30' E.; a few leagues to the S. W. of Strait Le Maire it was 24°; and at
anchor, within New Year's Isles, it was 24° 20' E.</p><p>These isles are, in general, so unlike Staten Land, especially the one on which we landed, that
it deserves a particular description. It shews a surface of equal height, and elevated about thirty
or forty feet above the sea, from which it is defended by a rocky coast. The inner part of the isle
is covered with a sort of sword-grass, very green, and of a great length. It grows on little
hillocks of two or three feet in diameter, and as many or more in height, in large tufts, which
seemed to be composed of the roots of the plant matted together. Among these hillocks are a vast
number of paths made by sea-bears and penguins, by which they retire into the centre of the isle. It
is, nevertheless, exceedingly bad travelling; for these paths are so dirty that one is sometimes up
to the knees in mire. Besides this plant, there are a few other grasses, a kind of heath, and some
celery. The whole surface is moist and wet, and on the coast are several small streams of water. The
sword-grass, as I call it, seems to be the same that grows in Falkland Isles, described by
Bougainville as a kind of <emph>gladiolus</emph>, or rather a species of <emph>gramen</emph>* and
named by Pernety corn-flags.</p><p>[See English translation of Bougainville, p.51.]</p><p>The animals found on this little spot are sea-lions, sea-bears, a variety of oceanic, and some
land-birds. The sea-lion is pretty well described by Pernety, though those we saw here have not such
fore-feet or fins as that he has given a plate of, but such fins as that which he calls the
sea-wolf. Nor did we see any of the size he speaks of; the largest not being more than twelve or
fourteen feet in length, and perhaps eight or ten in circumference. They are not of that kind
described under the same name by Lord Anson; but, for aught I know, these would more properly
deserve that appellation: The long hair, with which the back of the head, the neck and shoulders,
are covered, giving them greatly the air and appearance of a lion. The other part of the body is
covered with short hair, little longer than that of a cow or a horse, and the whole is a dark-brown.
The female is not half so big as the male, and is covered with a short hair of an ash or light-dun
colour. They live, as it were, in herds, on the rocks, and near the sea-shore. As this was the time
for engendering as well as bringing forth their young, we have seen a male with twenty or thirty
females about him, and always very attentive to keep them all to himself, and beating off every
other male who attempted to come into his flock. Others again had a less number; some no more than
one or two; and here and there we have seen one lying growling in a retired, place, alone, and
suffering neither males nor females to approach him: We judged these were old and superannuated.</p><p>The sea-bears are not so large, by far, as the lions, but rather larger than a common seal. They
have none of that long hair which distinguishes the lion. Theirs is all of an equal length, and
finer than that of the lion, something like an otter's, and the general colour is that of an
iron-grey. This is the kind which the French call sea-wolfs, and the English seals; they are,
however, different from the seals we have in Europe and North America. The lions may, too, without
any great impropriety, be called over-grown seals; for they are all of the same species. It was not
at all dangerous to go among them, for they either fled or lay still. The only danger was in going
between them and the sea; for if they took fright at any thing, they would come down in such
numbers, that, if you could not get out of their way, you would be run over. Sometimes, when we came
suddenly upon them, or waked them out of their sleep, (for they are a sluggish sleepy animal), they
would raise up their heads; snort and snarl, and look as fierce as if they meant to devour us; but
as we advanced upon them they always run away, so that they are downright bullies.</p><p>The penguin is an amphibious bird, so well known to most people, that I shall only observe, they
are here in prodigious numbers, so that we could knock down as many as we pleased with a stick. I
cannot say they are good eating. I have indeed made several good meals of them, but it was for want
of better victuals. They either do not breed here, or else this was not the season; for we saw
neither eggs nor young ones.</p><p>Shags breed here in vast numbers; and we carried on board not a few, as they are very good
eating. They take certain spots to themselves, and build their nests near the edge of the cliffs on
little hillocks, which are either those of the sword-grass, or else they are made by the shags
building on them from year to year. There is another sort rather smaller than these, which breed in
the cliffs of rocks.</p><p>The geese are of the same sort we found in Christmas Sound; we saw but few, and some had young
ones. Mr Forster shot one which was different from these, being larger, with a grey plumage, and
black feet. The others make a noise exactly like a duck. Here were ducks, but not many; and several
of that sort which we called race-horses. We shot some, and found them to weigh twenty-nine or
thirty pounds; those who eat of them said they were very good.</p><p>The oceanic birds were gulls, terns, Port Egmont hens, and a large brown bird, of the size of an
albatross, which Pernety calls quebrantahuessas. We called them Mother Carey's geese, and found them
pretty good eating; The land-birds were eagles, or hawks, bald-headed vultures, or what our seamen
called turkey-buzzards, thrushes, and a few other small birds.</p><p>Our naturalists found two new species of birds. The one is about the size of a pigeon, the
plumage as white as milk. They feed along-shore, probably on shell-fish and carrion, for they have a
very disagreeable smell. When we first saw these birds we thought they were the snow-peterel, but
the moment they were in our possession the mistake was discovered; for they resemble them in nothing
but size and colour. These are not webb-footed. The other sort is a species of curlews nearly as big
as a heron. It has a variegated plumage, the principal colours whereof are light-grey, and a long
crooked bill.</p><p>I had almost forgot to mention that there are sea-pies, or what we called, when in New Zealand,
curlews; but we only saw a few straggling pairs. It may not be amiss to observe, that the shags are
the same bird which Bougainville calls saw-bills; but he is mistaken in saying that the
quebrantahuessas are their enemies; for this bird is of the peterel tribe, feeds wholly on fish, and
is to be found in all the high southern latitudes.</p><p>It is amazing to see how the different animals which inhabit this little spot are mutually
reconciled. They seem to have entered into a league not to disturb each other's tranquillity. The
sea-lions occupy most of the sea-coast; the sea-bears take up their abode in the isle; the shags
have post in the highest cliffs; the penguins fix their quarters where there is the most easy
communication to and from the sea; and the other birds choose more retired places. We have seen all
these animals mix together, like domestic cattle and poultry in a farm-yard, without one attempting
to molest the other. Nay, I have often observed the eagles and vultures sitting on the hillocks
among the shags, without the latter, either young or old, being disturbed at their presence. It may
be asked how these birds of prey live? I suppose on the carcases of seals and birds which die by
various causes; and probably not few, as they are so numerous.</p><p>This very imperfect account is written more with a view to assist my own memory than to give
information to others. I am neither a botanist nor a naturalist; and have not words to describe the
productions of nature, either in the one branch of knowledge or the other.</p></div><div type="chapter"><head><l>CHAPTER V.</l><l><emph>Proceedings after leaving Staten Island, with an Account of the Discovery of the Isle of
Georgia, and a Description of it.</emph></l></head><p><date>1775 January</date></p><p>Having left the land in the evening of the 3d, as before mentioned, we saw it again next morning,
at <time>three o'clock</time>, bearing west. Wind continued to blow a steady fresh breeze till six p.m., when it
shifted in a heavy squall to S.W., which came so suddenly upon us, that we had not time to take in
the sails, and was the occasion of carrying away a top-gallant mast, a studding-sail boom, and a
fore studding-sail. The squall ended in a heavy shower of rain, but the wind remained at S.W. Our
course was S.E., with a view of discovering that extensive coast laid down by Mr Dalrymple in his
chart, in which is the gulph of St Sebastian. I designed to make the western point of that gulph, in
order to have all the other parts before me. Indeed I had some doubt of the existence of such a
coast; and this appeared to me the best route for clearing it up, and for exploring the southern
part of this ocean.</p><p>On the 5th, fresh gales, and wet and cloudy weather. At <time>noon</time> observed in <geo select="lat">57° 9' S</geo>, latitude made
from Cape St John, 5° 2' E. At <time>six o'clock</time> p.m., being in the latitude <geo select="lat">57° 21' S</geo>, and in longitude <geo select="lon">57°
45' W</geo>., the variation was 21° 28' E.</p><p>At <time>eight o'clock  in the evening</time> of the 6th, being then in the latitude of <geo select="lat">58° 9' S</geo>., longitude
<geo select="lon">53° 14' W</geo>., we close-reefed our top-sails, and hauled to the north, with a very strong gale at west,
attended with a thick haze and sleet. The situation just mentioned is nearly the same that Mr
Dalrymple assigns for the S.W. point of the gulph of St Sebastian. But as we saw neither land, nor
signs of land, I was the more doubtful of its existence, and was fearful that, by keeping to the
south, I might miss the land said to be discovered by La Roche in 1675, and by the ship Lion in
1756, which Mr Dalrymple places in 54° 30' latitude, and 45° of longitude; but on looking over
D'Anville's chart, I found it laid down 9° or 10° more to the west; this difference of situation
being to me a sign of the uncertainty of both accounts, determined me to get into the parallel as
soon as possible, and was the reason of my hauling to the north at this time.</p><p>Towards the morning of the 7th the gale abated, the weather cleared up, and the wind veered to
the W.S.W., where it continued till midnight, after which it veered to N.W. Being at this time in
the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="1">56° 4' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">53° 36' W</geo>., we sounded, but found no bottom with a line of one
hundred and thirty fathoms. I still kept the wind on the larboard-tack, having a gentle breeze and
pleasant weather. On the 8th, at <time>noon</time>, a bed of sea-weed passed the ship. In the <time>afternoon</time>, in
latitude <geo select="lat" n="2">55° 4' S</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon" n="2">51° 43' W</geo>., the variation was 20° 4' E.</p><p>On the 9th, wind at N.E., attended with thick hazy weather; saw a seal, and a piece of sea-weed.
At <time>noon</time>, latitude <geo select="lat" n="1">55° 12' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">50° 15' W</geo>., the wind and weather continuing the same till
towards midnight, when the latter cleared up, and the former veered to west, and blew a gentle gale.
We continued to ply till <time>two o'clock</time> the next morning, when we bore away east, and at eight E.N.E.;
at <time>noon</time>, observed in latitude <geo select="lat" n="2">54° 35' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="2">47° 56' W</geo>., a great many albatrosses and blue
peterels about the ship. I now steered east, and the next morning, in the latitude of<geo select="lat" n="3"> 54° 38' S</geo> ,
longitude <geo select="lon" n="3">45° 10' W</geo>., the variation was 19° 25' E. In the <time>afternoon</time> saw several penguins, and some
pieces of weed.</p><p>Having spent the night lying-to, on the 12th, at day-break, we bore away, and steered east
northerly, with a fine fresh breeze at W.S.W.; at <time>noon</time> observed in latitude <geo select="lat">54° 28' S</geo>., longitude in
<geo select="lon">42° 8' W</geo>.; that is, near 3° E. of the situation in which Mr Dalrymple places the N.E. point of the
gulph of St Sebastian; but we had no other signs of land than seeing a seal and a few penguins; on
the contrary, we had a swell from E.S.E., which would hardly have been, if any extensive track of
land lay in that direction. In the evening the gale abated, and at midnight it fell calm.</p><p>The calm, attended by a thick fog, continued till six next morning, when we got a wind at east,
but the fog still prevailed. We stood to the south till <time>noon</time>, when, being in the latitude of <geo select="lat">55° 7' S</geo>, 
we tacked and stretched to the north with a fresh breeze at E. by S. and E.S.E., cloudy weather; saw
several penguins and a snow-peterel, which we looked on to be signs of the vicinity of ice. The air
too was much colder than we had felt it since we left New Zealand. In the <time>afternoon</time> the wind veered
to the S.E., and in the night to S.S.E., and blew fresh, with which we stood to the N.E.</p><p>At <time>nine o'clock</time> the next morning we saw an island of ice, as we then thought, but at <time>noon</time> were
doubtful whether it was ice or land. At this time it bore E. 3/4 S., distant thirteen leagues; our
latitude was <geo select="lat">53° 56' 1/2</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon">39° 24' W</geo>.; several penguins, small divers, a snow-peterel, and
a vast number of blue peterels about the ship. We had but little wind all the morning, and at two
p.m. it fell calm. It was now no longer doubted that it was land, and not ice, which we had in
sight. It was, however, in a manner wholly covered with snow. We were farther confirmed in our
judgement of its being land, by finding soundings at one hundred and seventy-five fathoms, a muddy
bottom. The land at this time bore E. by S., about twelve leagues distant. At <time>six o'clock</time> the calm
was succeeded by a breeze at N.E., with which we stood to S.E. At first it blew a gentle gale; but
afterwards increased so as to bring us under double-reefed top-sails, and was attended with snow and
sleet.</p><p>We continued to stand to the S.E. till seven in the morning on the 15th, when the wind veering to
the S.E., we tacked and stood to the north. A little before we tacked, we saw the land bearing E. by
N. At <time>noon</time> the mercury in the thermometer was at 35° 1/4. The wind blew in squalls, attended with
snow and sleet, and we had a great sea to encounter. At a lee-lurch which the ship took, Mr Wales
observed her to lie down 42°. At half past four p.m. we took in the top-sails, got down top-gallant
yards, wore the ship, and stood to the S.W., under two courses. At midnight the storm abated, so
that we could carry the top-sails double-reefed.</p><p>At four in the morning of the 16th we wore and stood to the east, with the wind at S.S.E., a
moderate breeze, and fair; at <time>eight o'clock</time> saw the land extending from E. by N. to N.E. by N.;
loosed a reef out of each top-sail, got top-gallant yards across, and set the sails. At <time>noon</time>
observed in latitude <geo select="lat">54° 25' 1/2</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon">38° 18' W</geo>. In this situation we had one hundred and ten
fathoms water; and the land extended from N. 1/2 W. to E., eight leagues distant. The northern
extreme was the same that we first discovered, and it proved to be an island, which obtained the
name of Willis's Island, after the person who first saw it.</p><p>At this time we had a great swell from the south, an indication that no land was near us in that
direction; nevertheless the vast quantity of snow on that in sight induced us to think it was
extensive, and I chose to begin with exploring the northern coast. With this view we bore up for
Willis's Island, all sails set, having a fine gale at S.S.W. As we advanced to the north, we
perceived another isle lying east of Willis's, and between it and the main. Seeing there was a clear
passage between the two isles, we steered for it, and at <time>five o'clock</time>, being in the middle of it, we
found it about two miles broad.</p><p>Willis's Isle is an high rock of no great extent, near to which are some rocky islets. It is
situated in the latitude of <geo select="lat">54° S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">38° 23' W</geo>. The other isle, which obtained the name of
Bird Isle, on account of the vast number that were upon it, is not so high, but of greater extent,
and is close to the N.E. point of the main land, which I called Cape North.</p><p>The S.E. coast of this land, as far as we saw it, lies in the direction of S. 50° E., and N. 50°
W. It seemed to form several bays or inlets; and we observed huge masses of snow, or ice, in the
bottoms of them, especially in one which lies ten miles to the S.S.E. of Bird Isle.</p><p>After getting through the passage, we found the north coast trended E. by N., for about nine
miles; and then east and east-southerly to Cape Buller, which is eleven miles more. We ranged the
coast, at one league distance, till near <time>ten o'clock</time>, when we brought-to for the night, and on
sounding found fifty fathoms, a muddy bottom.</p><p>At <time>two o'clock  in the morning</time> of the 17th we made sail in for the land, with a fine breeze at
S.W.; at four, Willis's Isle bore W. by S., distant thirty-two miles; Cape Buller, to the west of
which lie some rocky islets, bore S.W. by W.; and the most advanced point of land to the east, S.
63° E. We now steered along shore, at the distance of four or five miles, till <time>seven o'clock</time>, when,
seeing the appearance of an inlet, we hauled in for it. As soon as we drew near the shore, having
hoisted out a boat, I embarked in it, accompanied by Mr Forster and his party, with a view of
reconnoitring the bay before we ventured in with the ship. When we put off from her, which was about
four miles from the shore, we had forty fathoms water. I continued to sound as I went farther in,
but found no bottom with a line of thirty-four fathoms, which was the length of that I had in the
boat, and which also proved too short to sound the bay, so far as I went up it. I observed it to lie
in S.W. by S. about two leagues, about two miles broad, well sheltered from all winds; and I judged
there might be good anchorage before some sandy beaches which are on each side, and likewise near a
low flat isle, towards the head of the bay. As I had come to a resolution not to bring the ship in,
I did not think it worth my while to go and examine these places; for it did not seem probable that
any one would ever be benefited by the discovery. I landed at three different places, displayed our
colours, and took possession of the country in his majesty's name, under a discharge of small
arms.</p><p>I judged that the tide rises about four or five feet, and that it is high water on the full and
change days about <time>eleven o'clock</time>.</p><p>The head of the bay, as well as two places on each side, was terminated by perpendicular
ice-cliffs of considerable height. Pieces were continually breaking off, and floating out to sea;
and a great fall happened while we were in the bay, which made a noise like cannon.</p><p>The inner parts of the country were not less savage and horrible. The wild rocks raised their
lofty summits till they were lost in the clouds, and the valleys lay covered with everlasting snow.
Not a tree was to be seen, nor a shrub even big enough to make a toothpick. The only vegetation we
met with was a coarse strong-bladed grass growing in tufts, wild burnet, and a plant like moss,
which sprung from the rocks.</p><p>Seals, or sea-bears, were pretty numerous. They were smaller than those at Staten Land: Perhaps
the most of those we saw were females, for the shores swarmed with young cubs. We saw none of that
sort which we call lions; but there were some of those which the writer of Lord Anson's voyage
describes under that name; at least they appeared to us to be of the same sort; and are, in my
opinion, very improperly called lions, for I could not see any grounds for the comparison.</p><p>Here were several flocks of penguins, the largest I ever saw; some which we brought on board
weighed from twenty-nine to thirty-eight pounds. It appears by Bougainville's account of the animals
of Falkland Islands, that this penguin is there; and I think it is very well described by him under
the name of first class of penguins*. The oceanic birds were albatrosses, common gulls, and that
sort which I call Port Egmont hens, terns, shags, divers, the new white bird, and a small bird like
those of the Cape of Good Hope, called yellow birds; which, having shot two, we found most delicious
food.</p><p>[* See Bougainville, English translation p.64.]</p><p>All the land birds we saw consisted of a few small larks, nor did we meet with any quadrupeds. Mr
Forster indeed observed some dung, which he judged to come from a fox, or some such animal. The
lands, or rather rocks, bordering on the sea-coast, were not covered with snow like the inland
parts; but all the vegetation we could see on the clear places was the grass above-mentioned. The
rocks seemed to contain iron. Having made the above observations, we set out for the ship, and got
on board a little after <time>twelve o'clock</time>, with a quantity of seals and penguins, an acceptable present
to the crew.</p><p>It must not, however, be understood that we were in want of provisions: we had yet plenty of
every kind; and since we had been on this coast, I had ordered, in addition to the common allowance,
wheat to be boiled every morning for breakfast; but any kind of fresh meat was preferred by most on
board to salt. For my own part, I was now, for the first time, heartily tired of salt meat of every
kind; and though the flesh of the penguins could scarcely vie with bullock's liver, its being fresh
was sufficient to make it go down. I called the bay we had been in, Possession Bay. It is situated
in the latitude of <geo select="lat">54° 5' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">37° 18' W</geo>., and eleven leagues to the east of Cape North. A
few miles to the west of Possession Bay, between it and Cape Buller, lies the Bay of Isles, so named
on account of several small isles lying in and before it.</p><p>As soon as the boat was hoisted in, we made sail along the coast to the east, with a fine breeze
at W.S.W. From Cape Buller the direction of the coast is S. 72° 30' E., for the space of eleven or
twelve leagues, to a projecting point, which obtained the name of Cape Saunders. Beyond this cape is
a pretty large bay, which I named Cumberland Bay. In several parts in the bottom of it, as also in
some others of less extent, lying between Cape Saunders and Possession Bay, were vast tracks of
frozen snow, or ice, not yet broken loose. At <time>eight o'clock</time>, being just past Cumberland Bay, and
falling little wind, we hauled off the coast, from which we were distant about four miles, and found
one hundred and ten fathoms water.</p><p>We had variable light airs and calms till <time>six o'clock</time> the next morning, when the wind fixed at
north, and blew a gentle breeze; but it lasted no longer than <time>ten o'clock</time>, when it fell almost to a
calm. At <time>noon</time>, observed in latitude <geo select="lat">54° 30' S</geo>., being then about two or three leagues from the
coast, which extended from N. 59° W. to S. 13° W. The land in this last direction was an isle, which
seemed to be the extremity of the coast to the east. The nearest land to us being a projecting point
which terminated in a round hillock, was, on account of the day, named Cape Charlotte. On the west
side of Cape Charlotte lies a bay which obtained the name of Royal Bay, and the west point of it was
named Cape George. It is the east point of Cumberland Bay, and lies in the direction of S.E. by E.
from Cape Saunders, distant seven leagues. Cape George and Cape Charlotte lie in the direction of S.
37° E. and N. 37° W., distant six leagues from each other. The isle above-mentioned, which was
called Cooper's Isle, after my first lieutenant, lies in the direction of S. by E., distant eight
leagues from Cape Charlotte. The coast between them forms a large bay, to which I gave the name of
Sandwich. The wind being variable all the <time>afternoon</time> we advanced but little; in the night it fixed at
S. and S.S.W., and blew a gentle gale, attended with showers of snow.</p><p>The 19th was wholly spent in plying, the wind continuing at S. and S.S.W., clear pleasant
weather, but cold. At sunrise a new land was seen, bearing S.E. 1/2 E. It first appeared in a single
hill, like a sugar-loaf; some time after other detached pieces appeared above the horizon near the
hill. At <time>noon</time>, observed in the latitude <geo select="lat">54° 42' 30" S</geo>., Cape Charlotte bearing N. 38° W., distant
four leagues; and Cooper's Isle S. 31° W. In this situation a lurking rock, which lies off Sandwich
Bay, five miles from the land, bore W. 1/2 N., distant one mile, and near this rock were several
breakers. In the <time>afternoon</time> we had a prospect of a ridge of mountains behind Sandwich Bay, whose
lofty and icy summits were elevated high above the clouds. The wind continued at S.S.W. till six
o'clock, when it fell to a calm. At this time Cape Charlotte bore N. 31° W., and Cooper's Island
W.S.W. In this situation we found the variation, by the azimuths, to be 11° 39', and by the
amplitude, <geo select="lon">11° 12' E</geo>. At <time>ten o'clock</time>, a light breeze springing up at north, we steered to the south
till twelve, and then brought-to for the night.</p><p>At <time>two o'clock  in the morning</time> of the 20th we made sail to S.W. round Cooper's Island. It is a
rock of considerable height, about five miles in circuit, and one mile from the main. At this isle
the main coast takes a S.W. direction for the space of four or five leagues to a point, which I
called Cape Disappointment. Off that are three small isles, the southernmost of which is green, low,
and flat, and lies one league from the cape.</p><p>As we advanced to S.W. land opened, off this point, in the direction of N. 60° W., and nine
leagues beyond it. It proved an island quite detached from the main, and obtained the name of
Pickersgill Island, after my third officer. Soon after a point of the main, beyond this island, came
in sight, in the direction of N. 55° W., which exactly united the coast at the very point we had
seen, and taken the bearing of, the day we first came in with it, and proved to a demonstration that
this land, which we had taken for part of a great continent, was no more than an island of seventy
leagues in circuit.</p><p>Who would have thought that an island of no greater extent than this, situated between the
latitude of<geo select="lat">54° S</geo>  and 55°, should, in the very height of summer, be in a manner wholly covered, many
fathoms deep, with frozen snow, but more especially the S.W. coast? The very sides and craggy
summits of the lofty mountains were cased with snow and ice; but the quantity which lay in the
valleys is incredible; and at the bottom of the bays the coast was terminated by a wall of ice of
considerable height. It can hardly be doubted that a great deal of ice is formed here in the water,
which in the spring is broken off, and dispersed over the sea; but this island cannot produce the
ten-thousandth part of what we saw; so that either there must be more land, or the ice is formed
without it. These reflections led me to think that the land we had seen the preceding day might
belong to an extensive track, and I still had hopes of discovering a continent. I must confess the
disappointment I now met with did not affect me much; for, to judge of the bulk by the sample, it
would not be worth the discovery.</p><p>I called this island the isle of Georgia, in honour of his majesty. It is situated, between the
latitudes of 53° 57' and <geo select="lat" n="1">54° 57' S</geo>.; and between 38° 13' and <geo select="lon" n="1">35° 34' W</geo>est longitude. It extends S.E.
by E. and N.W. by W., and is thirty-one leagues long in that direction; and its greatest breadth is
about ten leagues. It seems to abound with bays and harbours, the N.E. coast especially; but the
vast quantity of ice must render them inaccessible the greatest part of the year; or, at least, it
must be dangerous lying in them, on account of the breaking up of the ice cliffs.</p><p>It is remarkable that we did not see a river, or stream of fresh water, on the whole coast. I
think it highly probable that there are no perennial springs in the country; and that the interior
parts, as being much elevated, never enjoy heat enough to melt the snow in such quantities as to
produce a river, or stream, of water. The coast alone receives warmth sufficient to melt the snow,
and this only on the N.E. side; for the other, besides being exposed to the cold south winds, is, in
a great degree, deprived of the sun's rays, by the uncommon height of the mountains.</p><p>It was from a persuasion that the sea-coast of a land situated in the latitude of<geo select="lat">54° S</geo> , could not,
in the very height of summer, be wholly covered with snow, that I supposed Bouvet's discovery to be
large islands of ice. But after I had seen this land, I no longer hesitated about the existence of
Cape Circumcision; nor did I doubt that I should find more land than I should have time to explore.
With these ideas I quitted this coast, and directed my course to the E.S.E. for the land we had seen
the preceding day.</p><p>The wind was very variable till <time>noon</time>, when it fixed at N.N.E., and blew a gentle gale; but it
increased in such a manner, that, before <time>three o'clock</time>, we were reduced to our two courses, and
obliged to strike top-gallant yards. We were very fortunate in getting clear of the land, before
this gale overtook us; it being hard to say what might have been the consequence had it come on
while we were on the north coast. This storm was of short duration; for, at <time>eight o'clock</time> it began
to abate; and at midnight it was little wind. We then took the opportunity to sound, but found no
bottom with a line of an hundred and eighty fathoms.</p><p>Next day the storm was succeeded by a thick fog, attended with rain; the wind veered to N.W.,
and, at five in the morning, it fell calm, which continued till eight; and then we got a breeze
southerly, with which we stood to the east till three in the <time>afternoon</time>. The weather then coming
somewhat clear, we made sail, and steered north in search of land; but, at half-past six, we were
again involved in a thick mist, which made it necessary to haul the wind, and spend the night in
making short boards.</p><p>We had variable light airs next to a calm, and thick foggy weather, till half-past <time>seven o'clock</time>
in the evening of the 22d, when we got a fine breeze at north, and the weather was so clear that we
could see two or three leagues round us. We seized the opportunity, and steered to west; judging we
were to the east of the land. After running ten miles to the west, the weather again became foggy,
and we hauled the wind, and spent the night under top-sails.</p><p>Next morning at <time>six o'clock</time>, the fog clearing away, so that we could see three or four miles, I
took the opportunity to steer again to the west, with the wind at east, a fresh breeze; but two
hours after, a thick fog once more obliged us to haul the wind to the south. At <time>eleven o'clock</time>, a
short interval of clear weather gave us view of three or four rocky islets extending from S.E. to
E.N.E., two or three miles distant; but we did not see the Sugar-Loaf Peak beforementioned. Indeed,
two or three miles was the extent of our horizon.</p><p>We were well assured that this was the land we had seen before, which we had now been quite
round; and therefore it could be no more than a few detached rocks, receptacles for birds, of which
we now saw vast numbers, especially shags, who gave us notice of the vicinity of land before we saw
it. These rocks lie in the latitude of <geo select="lat">55° S</geo>., and S. 75° E., distant twelve leagues from Cooper's
Isle.</p><p>The interval of clear weather was of very short duration, before we had as thick a fog as ever,
attended with rain, on which we tacked in sixty fathoms water, and stood to the north. Thus we spent
our time, involved in a continual thick mist; and, for aught we knew, surrounded by dangerous rocks.
The shags and soundings were our best pilots; for after we had stood a few miles to the north, we
got out of soundings, and saw no more shags. The succeeding day and night we spent in making short
boards; and at <time>eight o'clock</time> on the 24th, judging ourselves not far from the rocks by some
straggling shags which came about us, we sounded in sixty fathoms water, the bottom stones and
broken shells. Soon after, we saw the rocks bearing S.S.W. 1/2 W., four miles distant, but still we
did not see the peak. It was, no doubt, beyond our horizon, which was limited to a short distance;
and, indeed, we had but a transient sight of the other rocks, before they were again lost in the
fog.</p><p>With a light air of wind at north, and a great swell from N.E., we were able to clear the rocks
to the west; and, at four in the p.m., judging ourselves to be three or four leagues east and west
of them, I steered south, being quite tired with cruizing about them in a thick fog; nor was it
worth my while to spend any more time in waiting for clear weather, only for the sake of having a
good sight of a few straggling rocks. At <time>seven o'clock</time>, we had at intervals a clear sky to the west,
which gave us a sight of the mountains of the isle of Georgia, bearing W.N.W., about eight leagues
distant. At <time>eight o'clock</time> we steered S.E. by S., and at ten S.E. by E., with a fresh breeze at
north, attended with a very thick fog; but we were, in some measure, acquainted with the sea over
which we were running. The rocks above-mentioned obtained the name of Clerke's Rocks, after my
second officer, he being the first who saw them.</p></div><div type="chapter"><head><l>CHAPTER VI.</l><l><emph> Proceedings after leaving the Isle of Georgia, with an Account of the Discovery of
Sandwich Land; with some Reasons for there being Land about the South Pole</emph>.</l></head><p><date>1775 January</date></p><p>On the 25th, we steered E.S.E., with a fresh gale at N.N.E., attended with foggy weather, till
towards the evening, when the sky becoming clear, we found the variation to be 9° 26' E., being at
this time in the latitude of <geo select="lat">56° 16' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">32° 9' W</geo>.</p><p>Having continued to steer E.S.E., with a fine gale at N.N.W., till day-light next morning, on
seeing no land to the east, I gave orders to steer south, being at this time in the latitude of<geo select="lat" n="1">56° 
33' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">31° 10' W</geo>. The weather continued clear, and gave us an opportunity to observe
several distances of the sun and moon for the correcting our longitude, which at <time>noon</time> was <geo select="lon" n="2">31° 4' W</geo>.,
the latitude observed <geo select="lat" n="2">57° 38' S</geo>. We continued to steer to the south till the 27th, at <time>noon</time>, at which
time we were in the latitude of <geo select="lat">59° 46' S</geo>., and had so thick a fog that we could not see a ship's
length. It being no longer safe to sail before the wind, as we were to expect soon to fall in with
ice, I therefore hauled to the east, having a gentle breeze at N.N.E. Soon after the fog clearing
away, we resumed our course to the south till <time>four o'clock</time>, when it returned again as thick as ever,
and made it necessary for us to haul upon a wind.</p><p>I now reckoned we were in latitude <geo select="lat">60° S</geo>., and farther I did not intend to go, unless I observed
some certain signs of soon meeting with land. For it would not have been prudent in me to have spent
my time in penetrating to the south, when it was at least as probable that a large tract of land
might be found near Cape Circumcision. Besides, I was tired of these high southern latitudes, where
nothing was to be found but ice and thick fogs. We had now a long hollow swell from the west, a
strong indication that there was no land in that direction; so that I think I may venture to assert
that the extensive coast, laid down in Mr Dalrymple's chart of the ocean between Africa and America,
and the Gulph of St Sebastian, do not exist.</p><p>At <time>seven o'clock  in the evening</time>, the fog receding from us a little, gave us a sight of an ice
island, several penguins and some snow peterels; we sounded, but found no ground at one hundred and
forty fathoms. The fog soon returning, we spent the night in making boards over that space which we
had, in some degree, made ourselves acquainted with in the day.</p><p>At eight in the morning of the 28th, we stood to the east, with a gentle gale at north; the
weather began to clear up; and we found the sea strewed with large and small ice; several penguins,
snow peterels, and other birds were seen, and some whales. Soon after we had sun-shine, but the air
was cold; the mercury in the thermometer stood generally at thirty-five, but at <time>noon</time> it was 37°; the
latitude by observation was <geo select="lat">60° 4' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">29° 23' W</geo>.</p><p>We continued to stand to the east till half-past <time>two o'clock</time>, p.m., when we fell in, all at once,
with a vast number of large ice-islands, and a sea strewed with loose ice. The weather too was
become thick and hazy, attended with drizzling rain and sleet, which made it the more dangerous to
stand in among the ice. For this reason we tacked and stood back to the west, with the wind at
north. The ice-islands, which at this time surrounded us, were nearly all of equal height, and
shewed a flat even surface; but they were of various extent, some being two or three miles in
circuit. The loose ice was what had broken from these isles.</p><p>Next morning, the wind falling and veering to S.W., we steered N.E.; but this coarse was soon
intercepted by numerous ice-islands; and, having but very little wind, we were obliged to steer such
courses as carried us the clearest of them; so that we hardly made any advance, one way or other,
during the whole day. Abundance of whales and penguins were about us all the time; and the weather
fair, but dark and gloomy.</p><p>At midnight the wind began to freshen at N.N.E., with which we stood to the N.W., till six in the
morning of the 30th, when the wind veering to N.N.W., we tacked and stood to N.E., and soon after
sailed through a good deal of loose ice, and passed two large islands. Except a short interval of
clear weather about <time>nine o'clock</time>, it was continually foggy, with either sleet or snow. At <time>noon</time> we
were, by our reckoning, in the latitude of <geo select="lat">59° 3O' S</geo>  S., longitude <geo select="lon">29° 24' W</geo>.</p><p>Continuing to stand to N.E. with a fresh breeze at N.N.W., at <time>two o'clock</time>, we passed one of the
largest ice-islands we had seen in the voyage, and some time after passed two others, which were
much smaller; Weather still foggy, with sleet: And the wind continued at N. by W., with which we
stood to N.E., over a sea strewed with ice.</p><p>At half an hour past six next morning, as we were standing N.N.E. with the wind at west, the fog
very fortunately clearing away a little, we discovered land ahead, three or four miles distant. On
this we hauled the wind to the north; but finding we could not weather the land on this tack, we
soon after tacked in one hundred and seventy-five fathoms water, three miles from the shore, and
about half a league from some breakers. The weather then cleared up a little more, and gave us a
tolerably good sight of the land. That which we had fallen in with proved three rocky islets of
considerable height. The outermost terminated in a lofty peak like a sugar-loaf, and obtained the
name of Freezeland Peak, after the man who first discovered it. Latitude <geo select="lat" n="1">59° S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">27° W</geo>.
Behind this peak, that is to the east of it, appeared an elevated coast, whose lofty snow-clad
summits were seen above the clouds. It extended from N. by E. to E.S.E., and I called it Cape
Bristol, in honour of the noble family of Hervey. At the same time another elevated coast appeared
in sight, bearing S.W. by S., and at <time>noon</time> it extended from S.E. to S.S.W., from four to eight
leagues distant; at this time the observed latitude was <geo select="lat" n="2">59° 13.5' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="2">27° 45' W</geo>. I
called this land Southern Thule, because it is the most southern land that has ever yet been
discovered. It shews a surface of vast height, and is every where covered with snow. Some thought
they saw land in the space between Thule and Cape Bristol. It is more than probable that these two
lands are connected, and that this space is a deep bay, which I called Forster's Bay.</p><p>At <time>one o'clock</time>, finding that we could not weather Thule, we tacked and stood to the north, and at
four, Freezeland Peak bore east, distant three or four leagues. Soon after, it fell little wind, and
we were left to the mercy of a great westerly swell, which set right upon the shore. We sounded, but
a line of two hundred fathoms found no bottom.</p><p>At <time>eight o'clock</time>, the weather, which had been very hazy, clearing up, we saw Cape Bristol bearing
E.S.E., and terminating in a point to the north, beyond which we could see no land. This discovery
relieved us from the fear of being carried by the swell on the most horrible coast in the world, and
we continued to stand to the north all night, with a light breeze at west.</p><p><date>1775 February</date></p><p>On the 1st of February, at <time>four o'clock  in the morning</time>, we got sight of a new coast, which at six
o'clock bore N. 60° east. It proved a high promontory, which I named Cape Montagu, situated in
latitude <geo select="lat">58° 27' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">26° 44' W</geo>est, and seven or eight leagues to the north of Cape
Bristol. We saw land from space to space between them, which made me conclude that the whole was
connected. I was sorry I could not determine this with greater certainty; but prudence would not
permit me to venture near a coast, subject to thick fogs, on which there was no anchorage; where
every port was blocked or filled up with ice; and the whole country, from the summits of the
mountains, down to the very brink of the cliffs which terminate the coast, covered, many fathoms
thick, with everlasting snow. The cliffs alone was all which was to be seen like land.</p><p>Several large ice-islands lay upon the coast; one of which attracted my notice. It had a flat
surface, was of considerable extent both in height and circuit, and had perpendicular sides, on
which the waves of the sea had made no impression; by which I judged that it had not been long from
land, and that it might lately have come out of some bay on the coast, where it had been formed.</p><p>At <time>noon</time> we were east and west of the northern part of Cape Montagu, distant about five leagues,
and Freezeland Peak bore S. 16° east, distant twelve leagues; latitude observed <geo select="lat">58° 25' S</geo>. In the
morning the variation was 10° 11' east<!--EB-B: Geocoders: Alas! No longitude readings in this paragraph. What we have here are bearings.-->. At two in the <time>afternoon</time>, as we were standing to the north,
with a light breeze at S.W., we saw land bearing N. 25' east, distant fourteen leagues. Cape Montagu
bore at this time, S. 66° east; at eight it bore S. 40° east; Cape Bristol, S. by E.; the new land
extending from N. 40° to 52° east; and we thought we saw land still more to the east, and beyond
it.</p><p>Continuing to steer to the north all night, at <time>six o'clock</time> the next morning a new land was seen
bearing N. 12° east, about ten leagues distant. It appeared in two hummocks just peeping above the
horizon; but we soon after lost sight of them; and having got the wind at N.N.E. a fresh breeze, we
stood for the northernmost land we had seen the day before, which at this time bore E.S.E. We
fetched in with it by <time>ten o'clock</time>, but could not weather it, and were obliged to tack three miles
from the coast, which extended from E. by S. to S.E., and had much the appearance of being an island
of about eight or ten leagues circuit. It shews a surface of considerable height, whose summit was
lost in the clouds, and, like all the neighbouring lands, covered with a sheet of snow and ice,
except in a projecting point on the north side, and two hills seen over this point, which probably
might be two islands. These only were clear of snow, and seemed covered with a green turf. Some
large ice islands lay to the N.E., and some others to the south.</p><p>We stood off till <time>noon</time>, and then tacked for the land again, in order to see whether it was an
island or no. The weather was now become very hazy, which soon turning to a thick fog, put a stop to
discovery, and made it unsafe to stand for the shore; so that after having run the same distance in,
as we had run off, we tacked and stood to N.W., for the land we had seen in the morning, which was
yet at a considerable distance. Thus we were obliged to leave the other, under the supposition of
its being an island, which I named Saunders, after my honourable friend Sir Charles. It is situated
in the latitude of <geo select="lat">57° 49' S</geo>outh longitude, <geo select="lon">26° 44' W</geo>est; and north, distant thirteen leagues, from
Cape Montagu.</p><p>At <time>six o'clock  in the evening</time>, the wind shifting to the west, we tacked, and stood to the north;
and at eight the fog clearing away, gave us a sight of Saunders's Isle, extending from S.E. by S. to
E.S.E. We were still in doubt if it was an island; for, at this time, land was seen bearing E. by
S., which might or might not be connected with it; it might also be the same that we had seen the
preceding evening. But, be this as it may, it was now necessary to take a view of the land to the
north, before we proceeded any farther to the east. With this intention, we stood to the north,
having a light breeze at W. by S., which at <time>two o'clock  in the morning</time> of the 3d, was succeeded by a
calm that continued till eight, when we got the wind at E. by S. attended by hazy weather. At this
time we saw the land we were looking for, and which proved to be two isles. The day on which they
were discovered, was the occasion of calling them Candlemas Isles; latitude <geo select="lat">57° 11' S</geo>., longitude
<geo select="lon">27° 6' W</geo>. They were of no great extent, but of considerable height, and were covered with snow. A
small rock was seen between them, and perhaps there may be more; for the weather was so hazy that we
soon lost sight of the islands, and did not see them again till <time>noon</time>, at which time they bore west,
distant three or four leagues.</p><p>As the wind kept veering to the south, we were obliged to stand to the N.E., in which route we
met with several large ice islands, loose ice, and many penguins; and at midnight, came at once into
water uncommonly white, which alarmed the officer of the watch so much, that he tacked the ship
instantly. Some thought it was a float of ice; others that it was shallow water; but, as it proved
neither, probably it was a shoal of fish.</p><p>We stood to the south till <time>two o'clock</time> next morning, when we resumed our course to the east with
a faint breeze at S.S.E. which having ended in a calm, at six, I took the opportunity of putting a
boat in the water to try if there were any current; and the trial proved there was none. Some whales
were playing about us, and abundance of penguins: a few of the latter were shot, and they proved to
be of the same sort that we had seen among the ice before, and different both from those on Staten
Land, and from those at the isle of Georgia. It is remarkable, that we had not seen a seal since we
left that coast. At <time>noon</time> we were in latitude of <geo select="lat">56° 44' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">25° 33' W</geo>. At this time we got
a breeze at east, with which we stood to the south, with a view of gaining the coast we had left;
but at <time>eight o'clock</time> the wind shifted to the south, and made it necessary to tack and stand to the
east; in which course we met with several ice-islands and some loose ice; the weather continuing
hazy with snow and rain.</p><p>No penguins were seen on the 5th, which made me conjecture that we were leaving the land behind
us, and that we had already seen its northern extremity. At <time>noon</time> we were in the latitude of <geo select="lat">57° 8' S</geo> 
S., longitude <geo select="lon">23° 34' W</geo>est, which was 3° of longitude to the east of Saunders's Isle. In the
<time>afternoon</time> the wind shifted to the west; this enabled us to stretch to the south, and to get into the
latitude of the land, that, if it took an east direction, we might again fall in with it.</p><p>We continued to steer to the south and S.E. till next day at <time>noon</time>, at which time we were in the
latitude of <geo select="lat">58° 15' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">21° 34' W</geo>est, and seeing neither land nor signs of any, I
concluded that what we had seen, which I named Sandwich Land, was either a group of islands, or else
a point of the continent. For I firmly believe that there is a tract of land near the Pole which is
the source of most of the ice that is spread over this vast southern ocean. I also think it probable
that it extends farthest to the north opposite the southern Atlantic and Indian oceans; because ice
was always found by us farther to the north in these oceans than any where else, which I judge could
not be, if there were not land to the south; I mean a land of considerable extent. For if we suppose
that no such land exists, and that ice may be formed without it, it will follow of course that the
cold ought to be every where nearly equal round the Pole, as far as 70° or 60' of latitude, or so
far as to be beyond the influence of any of the known continents; consequently we ought to see ice
every where under the same parallel, or near it; and yet the contrary has been, found. Very few
ships have met with ice going round Cape Horn: And we saw but little below the sixtieth degree of
latitude, in the Southern Pacific Ocean. Whereas in this ocean, between the meridian of <geo select="lon">40° W</geo>est and
50° or <geo select="lon">60° E</geo>ast, we found ice as far north as 51°. Bouvet met with, some in 48°, and others have
seen it in a much lower latitude. It is true, however, that the greatest part of this southern
continent (supposing there is one), must lie within the polar circle, where the sea is so pestered
with ice, that the land is thereby inaccessible. The risque one runs in exploring a coast, in these
unknown and icy seas, is so very great, that I can be bold enough to say that no man will ever
venture farther than I have done; and that the lands which may lie to the south will never be
explored. Thick fogs, snow storms, intense cold, and every other thing that can render navigation
dangerous, must be encountered, and these difficulties are greatly heightened by the inexpressibly
horrid aspect of the country; a country doomed by nature never once to feel the warmth of the sun's
rays, but to lie buried in everlasting snow and ice. The ports which may be on the coast, are, in a
manner, wholly filled up with frozen snow of vast thickness; but if any should be so far open as to
invite a ship into it, she would run a risque of being fixed there for ever, or of coming out in an
ice island. The islands and floats on the coast, the great falls from the ice-cliffs in the port, or
a heavy snow-storm attended with a sharp frost, would be equally fatal.</p><p>After such an explanation as this, the reader must not expect to find me much farther to the
south. It was, however, not for want of inclination, but for other reasons. It would have been
rashness in me to have risqued all that had been done during the voyage, in discovering and
exploring a coast, which, when discovered and explored, would have answered no end whatever, or have
been of the least use, either to navigation or geography, or indeed to any other science. Bouvet's
discovery was yet before us, the existence of which was to be cleared up; and, besides all this, we
were not now in a condition to undertake great things; nor indeed was there time, had we been ever
so well provided.</p><p>These reasons induced me to alter the course to the east, with a very strong gale at north,
attended with an exceedingly heavy fall of snow. The quantity which lodged on our sails was so
great, that we were frequently obliged to throw the ship up in the wind to shake it out of them,
otherwise neither they nor the ship could have supported the weight. In the evening it ceased to
snow; the weather cleared up, the wind backed to the west, and we spent the night in making two
short boards, under close-reefed top-sails and fore-sail.</p><p>At day-break on the 7th, we resumed our course to the east, with a very fresh gale at S.W. by W.,
attended by a high sea from the same direction. In the <time>afternoon</time>, being in the latitude of <geo select="lat">58° 24' S</geo> 
S., longitude <geo select="lon">16° 19' W</geo>est, the variation was 1° 52' east. Only three ice-islands seen this day. At
<time>eight o'clock</time>, shortened sail, and hauled the wind to the S.E. for the night, in which we had
several showers of snow and sleet.</p><p>On the 8th at day-light, we resumed our east course with a gentle breeze and fair weather. After
sun-rise, being then in the latitude of <geo select="lat">58° 30' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">15° 14' W</geo>est, the variation, by the
mean results of two compasses, was 2° 43' east. These observations were more to be depended on than
those made the night before, there being much less sea now than then. In the <time>afternoon</time>, we passed
three ice-islands. This night was spent as the preceding.</p><p>At six next morning, being in the latitude of <geo select="lat">58° 27' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">13° 4' W</geo>., the variation was
26' E.; and in the <time>afternoon</time>, being in the same latitude, and about a quarter of a degree more to
the east, it was 2' west. Therefore this last situation must be in or near the Line, in which the
compass has no variation. We had a calm the most part of the day. The weather fair and clear,
excepting now and then a snow-shower. The mercury in the thermometer at <time>noon</time> rose to 40; whereas,
for several days before, it had been no higher than 36 or 38. We had several ice-islands in sight,
but no one thing that could induce us to think that any land was in our neighbourhood. At eight in
the evening a breeze sprung up at S.E., with which we stood to N.E.</p><p>During the night the wind freshened and veered south, which enabled us to steer east. The wind
was attended with showers of sleet and snow till day-light, when the weather became fair, but
piercing cold, so that the water on deck was frozen, and at <time>noon</time> the mercury in the thermometer was
no higher than 34-1/2. At <time>six o'clock  in the morning</time>, the variation was 23' west, being then in the
latitude of <geo select="lat">58° 15' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">11° 41' W</geo>; and at six in the evening, being in the same latitude,
and in the longitude of <geo select="lon">9° 24' W</geo>., it was 1° 51' W. In the evening the wind abated; and during the
night, it was variable between south and west. Ice-islands continually in sight.</p><p>On the 11th, wind westerly, light airs attended with heavy showers of snow in the morning; but as
the day advanced, the weather became fair, clear, and serene. Still continuing to steer east, at
<time>noon</time> we observed in latitude <geo select="lat">58° 11' S</geo>, longitude at the same time <geo select="lon">7° 55' W</geo>est. Thermometer 34-2/3. In
the <time>afternoon</time> we had two hours calm; after which we had faint breezes between the N.E. and S.E.</p><p>At <time>six o'clock  in the morning</time> of the 12th, being in the latitude of <geo select="lat">58° 23' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">6° 54'
W</geo>., the variation was 3° 23' west. We had variable light airs next to a calm all this day, and the
weather was fair and clear till towards the evening, when it became cloudy with snow-showers, and
the air very cold. Ice-islands continually in sight; most of them small and breaking to pieces.</p><p>In the <time>afternoon</time> of the 13th, the wind increased, the sky became clouded, and soon after we had a
very heavy fall of snow, which continued till eight or <time>nine o'clock  in the evening</time>, when the wind
abating and veering to S.E., the sky cleared up, and we had a fair night, attended with so sharp a
frost, that the water in all our vessels on deck was next morning covered with a sheet of ice. The
mercury in the thermometer was as low as 29°, which is 3° below freezing, or rather 4; for we
generally found the water freeze when the mercury stood at 33°.</p><p>Towards <time>noon</time> on the 14th, the wind veering to the south, increased to a very strong gale, and
blew in heavy squalls attended with snow. At intervals, between the squalls, the weather was fair
and clear, but exceedingly cold. We continued to steer east, inclining a little to the north, and
in, the <time>afternoon</time> crossed the first meridian, or that of Greenwich, in the latitude of <geo select="lat">57° 50' S</geo>. At
eight in, the evening, we close-reefed the top-sails, took in the main-sail, and steered east with a
very hard gale at S.S.W., and a high sea from the same direction.</p><p>At day-break on the 15th, we set the main-sail, loosed a reef out of each top-sail, and with a
very strong gale at S.W., and fair weather, steered E.N.E. till <time>noon</time>, at which, time we were in
latitude of <geo select="lat">50° 37' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">4° 11' E</geo>., when we pointed to the N.E., in order to get into the
latitude of Cape Circumcision. Some large ice-islands were in sight, and the air was nearly as cold
as on the preceding day. At <time>eight o'clock  in the evening</time>, shortened sail, and at eleven hauled the
wind to the N.W., not daring to stand on in the night, which was foggy, with snow-showers, and a
smart frost.</p><p>At day-break on the 16th, we bore away N.E., with a light breeze at west, which, at <time>noon</time>, was
succeeded by a calm and fair weather. Our latitude at this time was <geo select="lat">55° 26' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">5° 52' E</geo>.,
in which situation we had a great swell from the southward, but no ice in sight. At <time>one o'clock</time> in
the p.m., a breeze springing up at E.N.E., we stood to S.E. till six, then tacked, and stood to the
north, under double-reefed top-sails and courses, having a very fresh gale attended with snow and
sleet, which fixed to the masts and rigging as it fell, and coated the whole with ice.</p><p>On the 17th the wind continued veering, by little and little, to the south, till midnight, when
it fixed at S.W. Being at this time in the latitude of <geo select="lat">54° 20' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">6° 33' E</geo>ast, I steered
east, having a prodigious high sea from the south, which assured us no land was near in that
direction.</p><p>In the morning of the 18th, it ceased to snow; the weather became fair and clear; and we found
the variation to be 18° 44' west. At <time>noon</time> we were in the latitude of <geo select="lat">54° 25' S</geo> , longitude <geo select="lon">8° 46' E</geo>ast.
I thought this a good latitude to keep in, to look for Cape Circumcision; because, if the land had
ever so little extent in the direction of north and south, we could not miss seeing it, as the
northern point is said to lie in 54°. We had yet a great swell from the south, so that I was now
well assured it could only be an island, and it was of no consequence which side we fell in with. In
the evening Mr Wales made several observations of the moon, and stars Regulus and Spica; the mean
results, at <time>four o'clock</time> when the observations were made, for finding the time by the watch, gave 9°
15' 20" east longitude. The watch at the same time gave 9° 36' 45". Soon after the variation was
found to be 13° 10' west. It is nearly in this situation that Mr Bouvet had 1° east. I cannot
suppose that the variation has altered so much since that time; but rather think he had made some
mistake in his observations. That there could be none in ours was certain, from the uniformity for
some time past. Besides, we found 12° 8' west, variation, nearly under this meridian, in January
1773. During the night the wind veered round by the N.W. to N.N.E. and blew a fresh gale.</p><p>At eight in the morning of the 19th, we saw the appearance of land in the direction of E. by S.,
or that of our course; but it proved a mere fog-bank, and soon after dispersed. We continued to
steer E. by S. and S.E., till <time>seven o'clock  in the evening</time>, when being in the latitude of <geo select="lat">54° 42' S</geo> 
S., longitude <geo select="lon">13° 3' E</geo>., and the wind having veered to N.E., we tacked and stood to N.W. under
close-reefed topsails and courses; having a very strong gale attended with snow-showers.</p><p>At <time>four o'clock</time> next morning, being in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="1">54° 30' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">12° 33'. E</geo>ast, we
tacked and stretched to N.E. with a fresh gale at S.W., attended with snow-showers and sleet. At
<time>noon</time>, being in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="2">54° 8' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="2">12° 59' E</geo>., with a fresh gale at W. by N., and
tolerably clear weather, we steered east till <time>ten o'clock  in the evening</time>, when we brought-to, lest
we might pass any land in the night, of which we however had not the least signs.</p><p>At day-break, having made sail, we bore away E., and at <time>noon</time> observed in latitude <geo select="lat" n="1">54° 16' S</geo>.,
longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">16° 13' E</geo>ast, which is 5° to the east of the longitude in which Cape Circumcision is said
to lie; so that we began to think there was no such land in existence. I however continued to steer
east, inclining a little to the south, till <time>four o'clock</time> in the <time>afternoon</time> of the next day, when we
were in latitude <geo select="lat" n="2">54° 24' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="2">19° 18' E</geo>ast.</p><p>We had now run down thirteen degrees of longitude in the very latitude assigned for Bouvet's
Land. I was therefore well assured that what he had seen could be nothing but an island of ice; for,
if it had been land, it is hardly possible we could have missed it, though it were ever so small.
Besides, from the time of leaving the southern lands, we had not met with the least signs of any
other. But even suppose we had, it would have been no proof of the existence of Cape Circumcision;
for I am well assured that neither seals nor penguins, nor any of the oceanic birds, are indubitable
signs of the vicinity of land. I will allow that they are found on the coasts of all these southern
lands; but are they not also to be found in all parts of the southern ocean? There are, however,
some oceanic or aquatic birds which point out the vicinity of land; especially shags, which seldom
go out of sight of it; and gannets, boobies, and men-of-war birds, I believe, seldom go very far out
to sea.</p><p>As we were now no more than two degrees of longitude front our route to the south, when we left
the Cape of Good Hope, it was to no purpose to proceed any farther to the east under this parallel,
knowing that no land could be there. But an opportunity now offering of clearing up some doubts of
our having seen land farther to the south, I steered S.E. to get into the situation in which it was
supposed to lie.</p><p>We continued this course till <time>four o'clock</time> the next morning, and then S.E. by E. and E.S.E., till
eight in the evening, at which time we were in the latitude of <geo select="lat">55° 25' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">23° 22' E</geo>ast,
both deduced from observations made the same day; for, in the morning, the sky was clear at
intervals, and afforded an opportunity to observe several distances of the sun and moon, which we
had not been able to do for some time past, having had a constant succession of bad weather.</p><p>Having now run over the place where the land was supposed to lie, without seeing the least signs
of any, it was no longer to be doubted but that the ice-islands had deceived us as well as Mr
Bouvet. The wind by this time having veered to the north, and increased to a perfect storm, attended
as usual with snow and sleet, we handed the top-sails and hauled up E.N.E. under the courses. During
the night the wind abated, and veered to N.W., which enabled us to steer more to the north, having
no business farther south.</p></div><div type="chapter"><head><l>CHAPTER VII.</l><l><emph>Heads of what has been done in the Voyage; with some Conjectures concerning the Formation
of Ice-Islands; and an Account of our Proceedings till our Arrival at the Cape of Good
Hope.</emph></l></head><p><date>1775 February</date></p><p>I had now made the circuit of the southern ocean in a high latitude, and traversed it in such a
manner as to leave not the least room for the possibility of there being a continent, unless near
the Pole, and out of the reach of navigation. By twice visiting the tropical sea, I had not only
settled the situation of some old discoveries, but made there many new ones, and left, I conceive,
very little more to be done even in that part. Thus I flatter myself, that the intention of the
voyage has, in every respect, been fully answered; the southern hemisphere sufficiently explored,
and a final end put to the searching after a southern continent, which has, at times, ingrossed the
attention of some of the maritime powers, for near two centuries past, and been a favourite theory
amongst the geographers of all ages.</p><p>That there may be a continent, or large tract of land, near the Pole, I will not deny; on the
contrary I am of opinion there is; and it is probable that we have seen a part of it. The excessive
cold, the many islands and vast floats of ice, all tend to prove that there must be land to the
south; and for my persuasion that this southern land must lie, or extend, farthest to the north
opposite to the southern Atlantic and Indian oceans, I have already assigned some reasons; to which
I may add the greater degree of cold experienced by us in these seas, than in the southern Pacific
ocean under the same parallels of latitude.</p><p>In this last ocean, the mercury in the thermometer seldom fell so low as the freezing point, till
we were in 60° and upwards; whereas in the others, it fell as low in the latitude of<geo select="lat">54° S</geo> . This was
certainly owing to there being a greater quantity of ice, and to its extending farther to the north,
in these two seas than in the south Pacific; and if ice be first formed at, or near land, of which I
have no doubt, it will follow that the land also extends farther north.</p><p>The formation or coagulation of ice-islands has not, to my knowledge, been thoroughly
investigated. Some have supposed them to be formed by the freezing of the water at the mouths of
large rivers, or great cataracts, where they accumulate till they are broken off by their own
weight. My observations will not allow me to acquiesce in this opinion; because we never found any
of the ice which we took up incorporated with earth, or any of its produce, as I think it must have
been, had it been coagulated in land-waters. It is a doubt with me, whether there be any rivers in
these countries. It is certain, that we saw not a river, or stream of water, on all the coast of
Georgia, nor on any of the southern lands. Nor did we ever see a stream of water run from any of the
ice-islands. How are we then to suppose that there are large rivers? The valleys are covered, many
fathoms deep, with everlasting snow; and, at the sea, they terminate in icy cliffs of vast height.
It is here where the ice-islands are formed; not from streams of water, but from consolidated snow
and sleet, which is almost continually falling or drifting down from the mountains, especially in
the winter, when the frost must be intense. During that season, the ice-cliffs must so accumulate as
to fill up all the bays, be they ever so large. This is a fact which cannot be doubted, as we have
seen it so in summer. These cliffs accumulate by continual falls of snow, and what drifts from the
mountains, till they are no longer able to support their own weight; and then large pieces break
off, which we call ice-islands. Such as have a flat even surface, must be of the ice formed in the
bays, and before the flat vallies; the others, which have a tapering unequal surface, must be formed
on, or under, the side of a coast composed of pointed rocks and precipices, or some such uneven
surface. For we cannot suppose that snow alone, as it falls, can form, on a plain surface, such as
the sea, such a variety of high peaks and hills, as we saw on many of the ice-isles. It is certainly
more reasonable to believe that they are formed on a coast whose surface is something similar to
theirs. I have observed that all the ice-islands of any extent, and before they begin to break to
pieces, are terminated by perpendicular cliffs of clear ice or frozen snow, always on one or more
sides, but most generally all round. Many, and those of the largest size, which had a hilly and
spiral surface, shewed a perpendicular cliff, or side, from the summit of the highest peak down to
its base. This to me was a convincing proof, that these, as well as the flat isles, must have broken
off from substances like themselves, that is, from some large tract of ice.</p><p>When I consider the vast quantity of ice we saw, and the vicinity of the places to the Pole where
it is formed, and where the degrees of longitude are very small, I am led to believe that these
ice-cliffs extend a good way into the sea, in some parts, especially in such as are sheltered from
the violence of the winds. It may even be doubted if ever the wind is violent in the very high
latitudes. And that the sea will freeze over, or the snow that falls upon it, which amounts to the
same thing, we have instances in the northern hemisphere. The Baltic, the Gulph of St Laurence, the
Straits of Belle-Isle, and many other equally large seas, are frequently frozen over in winter. Nor
is this at all extraordinary, for we have found the degree of cold at the surface of the sea, even
in summer, to be two degrees below the freezing point; consequently nothing kept it from freezing
but the salt it contains, and the agitation of its surface. Whenever this last ceaseth in winter,
when the frost is set in, and there comes a fall of snow, it will freeze on the surface as it falls,
and in a few days, or perhaps in one night, form such a sheet of ice as will not be easily broken
up. Thus a foundation will be laid for it to accumulate to any thickness by falls of snow, without
its being at all necessary for the sea-water to freeze. It may be by this means these vast floats of
low ice we find in the spring of the year are formed, and which, after they break up, are carried by
the currents to the north. For, from all the observations I have been able to make, the currents
every where, in the high latitudes, set to the north, or to the N.E. or N.W.; but we have very
seldom found them considerable.</p><p>If this imperfect account of the formation of these extraordinary floating islands of ice, which
is written wholly from my own observations, does not convey some useful hints to an abler pen, it
will, however, convey some idea of the lands where they are formed: Lands doomed by Nature to
perpetual frigidness; never to feel the warmth of the sun's rays; whose horrible and savage aspect I
have not words to describe. Such are the lands we have discovered; what then may we expect those to
be which lie still farther to the south? For we may reasonably suppose that we have seen the best,
as lying most to the north. If any one should have resolution and perseverance to clear up this
point by proceeding farther than I have done, I shall not envy him the honour of the discovery; but
I will be bold to say, that the world will not be benefited by it.</p><p>I had, at this time, some thoughts of revisiting the place where the French discovery is said to
lie. But then I considered that, if they had really made this discovery, the end would be as fully
answered as if I had done it myself. We know it can only be an island; and if we may judge from the
degree of cold we found in that latitude, it cannot be a fertile one. Besides, this would have kept
me two months longer at sea, and in a tempestuous latitude, which we were not in a condition to
struggle with. Our sails and rigging were so much worn, that something was giving way every hour;
and we had nothing left either to repair or to replace them. Our provisions were in a state of
decay, and consequently afforded little nourishment, and we had been a long time without
refreshments. My people, indeed, were yet healthy, and would have cheerfully gone wherever I had
thought proper to lead them; but I dreaded the scurvy laying hold of them at a time when we had
nothing left to remove it. I must say farther, that it would have been cruel in me to have continued
the fatigues and hardships they were continually exposed to, longer than was absolutely necessary.
Their behaviour, throughout the whole voyage, merited every indulgence which it was in my power to
give them. Animated by the conduct of the officers, they shewed themselves capable of surmounting
every difficulty and danger which came in their way, and never once looked either upon the one or
the other, as being at all heightened, by our separation from our consort the Adventure.</p><p>All these considerations induced me to lay aside looking for the French discoveries, and to steer
for the Cape of Good Hope; with a resolution, however, of looking for the isles of Denia and
Marseveen, which are laid down in Dr Halley's variation chart in the latitude of<geo select="lat">41.5° S</geo> ., and
about 4° of longitude to the east of the meridian of the Cape of Good Hope. With this view I steered
N.E., with a hard gale at N.W. and thick weather; and on the 25th, at <time>noon</time>, we saw the last ice
island, being at this time in the latitude of <geo select="lat">52° 52' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">26° 31' E</geo>.</p><p><date>1775 March</date></p><p>The wind abating and veering to the south, on the first of March, we steered west, in order to
get farther from Mr Bouvet's track, which was but a few degrees to the east of us, being at this
time in the latitude of <geo select="lat">46° 44' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">33° 20' E</geo>., in which situation we found the variation
to be 23° 36' W. It is somewhat remarkable, that all the time we had northerly winds, which were
regular and constant for several days, the weather was always thick and cloudy; but, as soon as they
came south of west, it cleared up, and was fine and pleasant. The barometer began to rise several
days before this change happened; but whether on account of it, or our coming northward, cannot be
determined.</p><p>The wind remained not long at south before it veered round by the N.E. to the N.W., blowing fresh
and by squalls, attended, as before, with rain and thick misty weather. We had some intervals of
clear weather in the <time>afternoon</time> of the 3d, when we found the variation to be 22° 26' W.; latitude at
this time <geo select="lat">45° 8' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">30° 50' E</geo>. The following night was very stormy, the wind blew from
S.W. and in excessively heavy squalls. At short intervals between the squalls the wind would fall
almost to a calm, and then come on again with such fury, that neither our sails nor rigging could
withstand it, several of the sails being split, and a middle stay-sail being wholly lost. The next
morning the gale abated, and we repaired the damage we had sustained in the best manner we
could.</p><p>On the 8th, being in the latitude of <geo select="lat">41° 30' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">26° 51' E</geo>., the mercury in the
thermometer rose to 61, and we found it necessary to put on lighter clothes. As the wind continued
invariably fixed between N.W. and W., we took every advantage to get to the west, by tacking
whenever it shifted any thing in our favour; but as we had a great swell against us, our tacks were
rather disadvantageous. We daily saw albatrosses, peterels, and other oceanic birds; but not the
least sign of land.</p><p>On the 11th, in the latitude of <geo select="lat">40° 40' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">23° 47' E</geo>., the variation was 20° 48' W.
About <time>noon</time> the same day the wind shifted suddenly from N.W. to S.W., caused the mercury in the
thermometer to fall as suddenly from 62° to 52°; such was the different state of the air, between a
northerly and southerly wind. The next day, having several hours calm, we put a boat in the water,
and shot some albatrosses and peterels, which, at this time, were highly acceptable. We were now
nearly in the situation where the isles which we were in search of, are said to lie; however, we saw
nothing that could give us the least hope of finding them.</p><p>The calm continued till <time>five o'clock</time> of the next morning, when it was succeeded by a breeze at W.
by S., with which we stood to N.N.W., and at <time>noon</time> observed in latitude <geo select="lat">38° 51' S</geo>. This was upwards
of thirty miles more to the north than our log gave us; and the watch shewed that we had been set to
the east also. If these differences did not arise from some strong current, I know not how to
account for them. Very strong currents have been found on the African coast, between Madagascar and
the Cape of Good Hope, but I never heard of their extending so far from the land; nor is it probable
they do. I rather suppose that this current has no connection with that on the coast; and that we
happened to fall into some stream which is neither lasting nor regular. But these are points which
require much time to investigate, and must therefore be left to the industry of future
navigators.</p><p>We were now two degrees to the north of the parallel in which the isles of Denia and Marseveen
are said to lie. We had seen nothing to encourage us to persevere in looking after them, and it must
have taken up some time longer to find them, or to prove their non-existence. Every one was
impatient to get into port, and for good reasons: As for a long time we had had nothing but stale
and salt provisions, for which every one on board had lost all relish. These reasons induced me to
yield to the general wish, and to steer for the Cape of Good Hope, being at this time in the
latitude of <geo select="lat">38° 38' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">23° 37' E</geo>.</p><p>The next day the observed latitude at <time>noon</time> was only seventeen miles to the north of that given by
the log; so that we had either got out of the strength of the current, or it had ceased.</p><p>On the 15th the observed latitude at <time>noon</time>, together with the watch, shewed that we had had a
strong current setting to the S.W., the contrary direction to what we had experienced on some of the
preceding days, as hath been mentioned.</p><p>At day-light, on the 16th, we saw two sail in the N.W. quarter standing to the westward, and one
of them shewing Dutch colours. At <time>ten o'clock</time> we tacked and stood to the west also, being at this
time in the latitude of <geo select="lat">39° 9' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">22° 38' E</geo>.</p><p>I now, in pursuance of my instructions, demanded of the officers and petty officers, the
log-books and journals they had kept; which were delivered to me accordingly, and sealed up for the
inspection of the Admiralty. I also enjoined them, and the whole crew, not to divulge where we had
been, till they had their lordships' permission so to do. In the <time>afternoon</time>, the wind veered to the
west, and increased to a hard gale, which was of short duration; for, the next day, it fell, and at
<time>noon</time> veered to S.E. At this time we were in the latitude of <geo select="lat">34° 49' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">22° E</geo>.; and, on
sounding, found fifty-six fathoms water. In the evening we saw the land in the direction of E.N.E.
about six leagues distant; and, during the fore-part of the night, there was a great fire or light
upon it.</p><p>At day-break on the 18th, we saw the land again, bearing N.N.W., six or seven leagues distant,
and the depth of water forty-eight fathoms. At <time>nine o'clock</time>, having little or no wind, we hoisted
out a boat, and sent on board one of the two ships before-mentioned, which were about two leagues
from us; but we were too impatient after news to regard the distance. Soon after, a breeze sprung up
at west, with which we stood to the south; and, presently, three sail more appeared in sight to
windward, one of which shewed English colours.</p><p>At one, p.m., the boat returned from on board the Bownkerke Polder, Captain Cornelius Bosch, a
Dutch Indiaman from Bengal. Captain Bosch, very obligingly, offered us sugar, arrack, and whatever
he had to spare. Our people were told by some English seamen on board this ship, that the Adventure
had arrived at the Cape of Good Hope twelve months ago, and that the crew of one of her boats had
been murdered and eaten by the people of New Zealand; so that the story which we heard in Queen
Charlotte's Sound was now no longer a mystery.</p><p>We had light airs next, to a calm till <time>ten o'clock</time> the next morning, when a breeze sprung up at
west, and the English ship, which was to windward, bore down to us. She proved to be the True
Briton, Captain Broadly, from China. As he did not intend to touch at the Cape, I put a letter on
board him for the secretary of the Admiralty.</p><p>The account which we had heard of the Adventure was now confirmed to us by this ship. We also
got, from on board her, a parcel of old newspapers, which were new to us, and gave us some
amusement; but these were the least favours we received from Captain Broadly. With a generosity
peculiar to the commanders of the India Company's ships, he sent us fresh provisions, tea, and other
articles which were very acceptable, and deserve from me this public acknowledgment. In the
<time>afternoon</time> we parted company. The True Briton stood out to sea, and we in for the land, having a very
fresh gale at west, which split our fore top-sail in such a manner, that we were obliged to bring
another to the yard. At <time>six o'clock</time> we tacked within four or five miles of the shore; and, as we
judged, about five or six leagues to the east of Cape Aguilas. We stood off till midnight, when, the
wind having veered round to the south, we tacked, and stood along-shore to the west. The wind kept
veering more and more in our favour, and at last fixed at E.S.E.; and blew for some hours a perfect
hurricane.</p><p>As soon as the storm began to subside, we made sail, and hauled in for the land. Next day at
<time>noon</time>, the Table Mountain over the Cape Town bore N.E. by E., distant nine or ten leagues. By making
use of this bearing and distance to reduce the longitude shewn by the watch to the Cape Town, the
error was found to be no more than 18' in longitude, which it was too far to the east. Indeed the
difference found between it and the lunar observations, since we left New Zealand, had seldom
exceeded half a degree, and always the same way.</p><p>The next morning, being with us Wednesday the 22d, but with the people here Tuesday the 21st, we
anchored in Table Bay, where we found several Dutch ships; some French; and the Ceres, Captain
Newte, an English East India Company's ship, from China, bound directly to England, by whom I sent a
copy of the preceding part of this journal, some charts, and other drawings to the Admiralty.</p><p>Before we had well got to an anchor, I dispatched an officer to acquaint the governor with our
arrival, and to request the necessary stores and refreshments; which were readily granted. As soon
as the officer came back, we saluted the garrison with thirteen guns, which compliment was
immediately returned with an equal number.</p><p>I now learnt that the Adventure had called here, on her return; and I found a letter from Captain
Furneaux, acquainting me with the loss of his boat, and of ten of his best men, in Queen Charlotte's
Sound. The captain, afterwards, on my arrival in England, put into my hands a complete narrative of
his proceedings, from the time of our second and final separation, which I now lay before the public
in the following section.</p></div><div type="chapter"><head><l>CHAPTER VIII.</l><l><emph>Captain Furneaux's Narrative of his Proceedings, in the Adventure, from, the Time he was
separated from the Resolution, to his Arrival in England; including Lieutenant Burney's Report
concerning the Boat's Crew who were murdered by the Inhabitants of Queen Charlottes
Sound</emph>.</l></head><p><date>1773 October</date></p><p>After a passage of fourteen days from Amsterdam, we made the coast of New Zealand near the Table
Cape, and stood along-shore till we came as far as Cape Turnagain. The wind then began to blow
strong at west, with heavy squalls and rain, which split many of our sails, and blew us off the
coast for three days; in which time we parted company with the Resolution, and never saw her
afterwards.</p><p><date>1773 November</date></p><p>On the 4th of November, we again got in shore, near Cape Palliser, and were visited by a number
of the natives in their canoes; bringing a great quantity of cray-fish, which we bought of them for
nails and Otaheite cloth. The next day it blew hard from W.N.W., which again drove us off the coast,
and obliged us to bring-to for two days; during which time it blew one continual gale of wind, with
heavy falls of sleet. By this time, our decks were very leaky; our beds and bedding wet; and several
of our people complaining of colds; so that we began to despair of ever getting into Charlotte's
Sound, or joining the Resolution.</p><p>On the 6th, being to the north of the cape, the wind at S.W., and blowing strong, we bore away
for some bay to complete our water and wood, being in great want of both, having been at the
allowance of one quart of water for some days past; and even that pittance could not be come at
above six or seven days longer. We anchored in Tolaga Bay on the 9th, in latitude <geo select="lat">38° 21' S</geo>.,
longitude <geo select="lon">178° 31' E</geo>ast. It affords good riding with the wind westerly, and regular soundings from
eleven to five fathoms, stiff muddy ground across the bay for about two miles. It is open from
N.N.E. to E.S.E. It is to be observed, easterly winds seldom blow hard on this shore; but when they
do, they throw in a great sea, so that if it were not for a great undertow, together with a large
river that empties itself in the bottom of the bay, a ship would not be able to ride here. Wood and
water are easily to be had, except when it blows hard easterly. The natives here are the same as
those at Charlotte's Sound, but more numerous, and seemed settled, having regular plantations of
sweet potatoes, and other roots, which are very good; and they have plenty of cray and other fish,
which we bought of them for nails, beads, and other trifles, at an easy rate. In one of their canoes
we observed the head of a woman lying in state, adorned with feathers and other ornaments. It had
the appearance of being alive; but, on examination, we found it dry, being preserved with every
feature perfect, and kept as the relic of some deceased relation.</p><p>Having got about ten tons of water, and some wood, we sailed for Charlotte's Sound on the 12th.
We were no sooner out than the wind began to blow hard, dead on the shore, so that we could not
clear the land on either tack. This obliged us to bear away again for the bay, where we anchored the
next morning, and rode out a very heavy gale of wind at E. by S., which threw in a very great sea.
We now began to fear we should never join the Resolution; having reason to believe she was in
Charlotte Sound, and by this time ready for sea. We soon found it was with great difficulty we could
get any water, owing to the swell setting in so strong; at last, however, we were able to go on
shore, and got both wood and water.</p><p>Whilst we lay here we were employed about the rigging, which was much damaged by the constant
gales of wind we had met with since we made the coast. We got the booms down on the decks, and
having made the ship as snug as possible, sailed again on the 16th. After this we met with several
gales of wind off the mouth of the Strait; and continued beating backwards and forwards till the
30th, when we were so fortunate as to get a favourable wind, which we took every advantage of, and
at last got safe into our desired port. We saw nothing of the Resolution, and began to doubt her
safety; but on going ashore, we discerned the place where she had erected her tents; and, on an old
stump of a tree in the garden, observed these words cut out, "Look underneath." There we dug, and
soon found a bottle corked and waxed down, with a letter in it from Captain Cook, signifying their
arrival on the 3d instant, and departure on the 24th; and that they intended spending a few days in
the entrance of the Straits to look for us.</p><p>We immediately set about getting the ship ready for sea as fast as possible; erected our tents;
sent the cooper on shore to repair the casks; and began to unstow the hold, to get at the bread that
was in butts; but on opening them found a great quantity of it entirely spoiled, and most part so
damaged, that we were obliged to fix our copper oven on shore to bake it over again, which
undoubtedly delayed us a considerable time. Whilst we lay here, the inhabitants came on board as
before, supplying us with fish, and other things of their own manufacture, which we bought of them
for nails, etc. and appeared very friendly, though twice in the middle of the night they came to the
tent, with an intention to steal; but were discovered before they could get any thing into their
possession.</p><p><date>1773 December</date></p><p>On the 17th of December, having refitted the ship, completed our water and wood, and got every
thing ready for sea, we sent our large cutter, with Mr Rowe, a midshipman, and the boat's crew, to
gather wild greens for the ship's company; with orders to return that evening, as I intended to sail
the next morning. But on the boat's not returning the same evening, nor the next morning, being
under great uneasiness about her, I hoisted out the launch, and sent her with the second lieutenant,
Mr Burney, manned with the boat's crew and ten marines, in search of her. My orders to Mr Burney
were first, to look well into East Bay, and then to proceed to Grass Cove, the place to which Mr
Rowe had been sent; and if he heard nothing of the boat there, to go farther up the sound, and come
back along the west shore. As Mr Rowe had left the ship an hour before the time proposed, and in a
great hurry, I was strongly persuaded that his curiosity had carried him into East Bay, none in our
ship having ever been there; or else, that some accident had happened to the boat, either by going
adrift through the boat-keeper's negligence, or by being stove among the rocks. This was almost
every body's opinion; and on this supposition, the carpenter's mate was sent in the launch, with
some sheets of tin. I had not the least suspicion that our people had received any injury from the
natives, our boats having frequently been higher up, and worse provided. How much I was mistaken,
too soon appeared; for Mr Burney having returned about <time>eleven o'clock</time> the same night, made his
report of a horrible scene indeed, which cannot be better described than in his own words, which now
follow.</p><p>"On the 18th, we left the ship; and having a light breeze in our favour, we soon got round Long
Island, and within Long Point. I examined every cove, on the larboard hand, as we went along,
looking well all around with a spy-glass, which I took for that purpose. At half past one, we
stopped at a beach on the left-hand side going up East Bay, to boil some victuals, as we brought
nothing but raw meat with us. Whilst we were cooking, I saw an Indian on the opposite shore, running
along a beach to the head of the bay. Our meat being drest, we got into the boat and put off; and,
in a short time, arrived at the head of this reach, where we saw an Indian settlement."</p><p>"As we drew near, some of the Indians came down on the rocks, and waved for us to be gone, but
seeing we disregarded them, they altered their notes. Here we found six large canoes hauled up on
the beach, most of them double ones, and a great many people; though not so many as one might expect
from the number of houses and size of the canoes. Leaving the boat's crew to guard the boat, I
stepped ashore with the marines (the corporal and five men), and searched a good many of their
houses, but found nothing to give me any suspicion. Three or four well-beaten paths led farther into
the woods, where were many more houses; but the people continuing friendly, I thought it unnecessary
to continue our search. Coming down to the beach, one of the Indians had brought a bundle of
<emph>Hepatoos</emph> (long spears), but seeing I looked very earnestly at him, he put them on the
ground, and walked about with seeming unconcern. Some of the people appearing to be frightened, I
gave a looking-glass to one, and a large nail to another. From this place the bay ran, as nearly as
I could guess, N.N.W. a good mile, where it ended in a long sandy beach. I looked all around with
the glass, but saw no boat, canoe, or sign of inhabitant. I therefore contented myself with firing
some guns, which I had done in every cove as I went along."</p><p>"I now kept close to the east shore, and came to another settlement, where the Indians invited us
ashore. I enquired of them about the boat, but they pretended ignorance. They appeared very friendly
here, and sold us some fish. Within an hour after we left this place, in a small beach adjoining to
Grass Cove, we saw a very large double canoe just hauled up, with two men and a dog. The men, on
seeing us, left their canoe, and ran up into the woods. This gave me reason to suspect I should here
get tidings of the cutter. We went ashore, and searched the canoe, where we found one of the
rullock-ports of the cutter, and some shoes, one of which was known to belong to Mr Woodhouse, one
of our midshipmen. One of the people, at the same time, brought me a piece of meat, which he took to
be some of the salt meat belonging to the cutter's crew. On examining this, and smelling to it, I
found it was fresh. Mr Fannin (the master) who was with me, supposed it was dog's flesh, and I was
of the same opinion; for I still doubted their being cannibals. But we were soon convinced by most
horrid and undeniable proof."</p><p>"A great many baskets (about twenty) lying on the beach, tied up, we cut them open. Some were
full of roasted flesh, and some of fern-root, which serves them for bread. On, farther search, we
found more shoes, and a hand, which we immediately knew to have belonged to Thomas Hill, one of our
fore-castle men, it being marked T.H. with an Otaheite tattow-instrument. I went with some of the
people a little way up the woods, but saw nothing else. Coming down again, there was a round spot
covered with fresh earth, about four feet diameter, where something had been buried. Having no
spade, we began to dig with a cutlass; and in the mean time I launched the canoe with intent to
destroy her; but seeing a great smoke ascending over the nearest hill, I got all the people into the
boat, and made what haste I could to be with them before sun-set."</p><p>"On opening the next bay, which was Grass Cove, we saw four canoes, one single and three double
ones, and a great many people on the beach, who, on our approach; retreated to a small hill, within
a ship's length of the water side, where they stood talking to us. A large fire was on the top of
the high land, beyond the woods, from whence, all the way down the hill, the place was thronged like
a fair. As we came in, I ordered a musquetoon to be fired at one of the canoes, suspecting they
might be full of men lying down in the bottom; for they were all afloat, but nobody was seen in
them. The savages on the little hill still kept hallooing, and making signs for us to land. However,
as soon as we got close in, we all fired. The first volley did not seem to affect them much; but on
the second, they began to scramble away as fast as they could, some of them howling. We continued
firing as long as we could see the glimpse of any of them through the bushes. Amongst the Indians
were two very stout men, who never offered to move till they found themselves forsaken by their
companions; and then they marched away with great composure and deliberation; their pride not
suffering them to run. One of them, however, got a fall, and either lay there, or crawled off on
all-fours. The other got clear, without any apparent hurt. I then landed with the marines, and Mr
Fannin staid to guard the boat."</p><p>"On the beach were two bundles of celery, which had been gathered for loading the cutter. A
broken oar was stuck upright in the ground, to which the natives had tied their canoes; a proof that
the attack had been made here. I then searched all along at the back of the beach, to see if the
cutter was there. We found no boat, but instead of her, such a shocking scene of carnage and
barbarity as can never be mentioned or thought of but with horror; for the heads, hearts, and lungs
of several of our people were seen lying on the beach, and, at a little distance, the dogs gnawing
their entrails."</p><p>"Whilst we remained almost stupified on the spot, Mr Fannin called to us that he heard the
savages gathering together in the woods; on which I returned to the boat, and hauling along-side the
canoes, we demolished three of them. Whilst this was transacting, the fire on the top of the hill
disappeared; and we could hear the Indians in the woods at high words; I suppose quarrelling whether
or no they should attack us, and try to save their canoes. It now grew dark; I therefore just
stepped out, and looked once more behind the beach to see if the cutter had been hauled up in the
bushes; but seeing nothing of her, returned, and put off. Our whole force would have been barely
sufficient to have gone up the hill; and to have ventured with half (for half must have been left to
guard the boat) would have been fool-hardiness."</p><p>"As we opened the upper part of the sound, we saw a very large fire about three or four miles
higher up, which formed a complete oval, reaching from the top of the hill down almost to the
water-side, the middle space being inclosed all round by the fire, like a hedge. I consulted with Mr
Fannin, and we were both of opinion that we could expect to reap no other advantage than the poor
satisfaction of killing some more of the savages. At leaving Grass Cove, we had fired a general
volley towards where we heard the Indians talking; but, by going in and out of the boat, the arms
had got wet, and four pieces missed fire. What was still worse, it began to rain; our ammunition was
more than, half expended, and we left six large canoes behind us in one place. With so many
disadvantages, I did not think it worth while to proceed, where nothing could be hoped for but
revenge."</p><p>"Coming between two round islands, situated to the southward of East Bay, we imagined we heard
somebody calling; we lay on our oars, and listened, but heard no more of it; we hallooed several
times, but to little purpose; the poor souls were far enough out of hearing, and, indeed, I think it
some comfort to reflect, that in all probability every man of them must have been killed on the
spot."</p><p>Thus far Mr Burney's report; and to complete the account of this tragical transaction, it may not
be unnecessary to mention, that the people in the cutter were Mr Rowe, Mr Woodhouse, Francis Murphy,
quarter-master; William Facey, Thomas Hill, Michael Bell, and Edward Jones, fore-castle men; John
Cavanaugh, and Thomas Milton, belonging to the after-guard; and James Sevilley, the captain's man,
being ten in all. Most of these were of our very best seamen, the stoutest and most healthy people
in the ship. Mr Burney's party brought on board two hands, one belonging to Mr Rowe, known by a hurt
he had received on it; the other to Thomas Hill, as before-mentioned; and the head of the captain's
servant. These, with more of the remains, were tied in a hammock, and thrown over-board, with
ballast and shot sufficient to sink it. None of their arms nor cloaths were found, except part of a
pair of trowsers, a frock, and six shoes, no two of them being fellows.</p><p>I am not inclined to think this was any premeditated plan of these savages; for, the morning Mr
Rowe left the ship, he met two canoes, which came down and staid all the fore-<time>noon</time> in Ship Cove. It
might probably happen from some quarrel which was decided on the spot, or the fairness of the
opportunity might tempt them, our people being so incautious, and thinking themselves too secure.
Another thing which encouraged the New Zealanders, was, they were sensible that a gun was not
infallible, that they sometimes missed, and that, when discharged, they must be loaded before they
could be used again, which time they knew how to take advantage of. After their success, I imagine
there was a general meeting on the east side of the sound. The Indians of Shag Cove were there; this
we knew by a cock which was in one of the canoes, and by a long single canoe, which some of our
people had seen four days before in Shag Cove, where they had been with Mr Rowe in the cutter.</p><p>We were detained in the Sound by contrary winds four days after this melancholy affair happened,
during which time we saw none of the inhabitants. What is very remarkable, I had been several times
up in the same cove with Captain Cook, and never saw the least sign of an inhabitant, except some
deserted towns, which appeared as if they had not been occupied for several years; and yet, when Mr
Burney entered the cove, he was of opinion there could not be less than fifteen hundred or two
thousand people. I doubt not, had they been apprized of his coming, they would have attacked him.
From these considerations, I thought it imprudent to send a boat up again; as we were convinced
there was not the least probability of any of our people being alive.</p><p>On the 23d, we weighed and made sail out of the Sound, and stood to the eastward to get clear of
the straits; which we accomplished the same evening, but were baffled for two or three days with
light winds, before we could clear the coast. We then stood to the S.S.E. till we got into the
latitude of <geo select="lat">56° S</geo>outh, without any thing remarkable happening, having a great swell from the
southward. At this time the wind began to blow strong from the S.W., and the weather to be very
cold; and as the ship was low and deep laden, the sea made a continual breach over her, which kept
us always wet; and by her straining, very few of the people were dry in bed or on deck, having no
shelter to keep the sea from them.</p><p>The birds were the only companions we had in this vast ocean, except, now and then, we saw a
whale or porpoise; and sometimes a seal or two, and a few penguins. In the latitude of <geo select="lat">58° S</geo>.,
longitude <geo select="lon">213°* E</geo>ast, we fell in with some ice, and, every day, saw more or less, we then standing
to the east. We found a very strong current setting to the eastward; for by the time we were abreast
of Cape Horn, being in the latitude of <geo select="lat">61° S</geo>., the ship was a-head of our account eight degrees. We
were very little more than a month from Cape Palliser in New Zealand to Cape Horn, which is an
<geo select="lon" ana="121">hundred and twenty-onE</geo> degrees of longitude, and had continual westerly winds from S.W. to N.W.,
with a great sea following.</p><p>[* About <geo select="lon">147 W</geo>est longitude, I reckon.]</p><p><date>1774 January</date></p><p>On opening some casks of pease and flour, that had been stowed on the coals, we found them very
much damaged, and not eatable; so thought it most prudent to make for the Cape of Good Hope, but
first to stand into the latitude and longitude of Cape Circumcision. After being to the eastward of
Cape Horn, we found the winds did not blow so strong from the westward as usual, but came more from
the north, which brought on thick foggy weather; so that for several days together we could not be
able to get an observation, or see the least sign of the sun. This weather lasted above a month,
being then among a great many islands of ice, which kept us constantly on the look-out, for fear of
running foul of them, and, being a single ship, made us more attentive. By this time our people
began to complain of colds and pains in their limbs, which obliged me to haul to the northward to
the latitude of <geo select="lat">54° S</geo>.; but we still continued to have the same sort of weather, though we had
oftener an opportunity of obtaining observations for the latitude.</p><p><date>1774 February</date></p><p>After getting into the latitude above-mentioned, I steered to the east, in order, if possible, to
find the land laid down by Bouvet. As we advanced to the east, the islands of ice became more
numerous and dangerous; they being much smaller than they used to be; and the nights began to be
dark.</p><p><date>1774 March</date></p><p>On the 3d of March, being then in the latitude of <geo select="lat">54° 4' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">13° E</geo>., which is the
latitude of Bouvet's discovery, and half a degree to the eastward of it, and not seeing the least
sign of land, either now or since we have been in this parallel, I gave over looking for it, and
hauled away to the northward. As our last track to the southward was within a few degrees of
Bouvet's discovery in the longitude assigned to it, and about three or four degrees to the
southward, should there be any land thereabout, it must be a very inconsiderable island. But I
believe it was nothing but ice: As we, in our first setting out, thought we had seen land several
times, but it proved to be high islands of ice at the back of the large fields; and as it was thick
foggy weather when Mr Bouvet fell in with it, he might very easily mistake them for land.</p><p>On the seventh, being in the latitude of <geo select="lat">48° 30' S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">14° 26' E</geo>., saw two large islands
of ice. </p><p>On the 17th, made the land of the Cape of Good Hope, and on the 19th anchored in Table Bay, where
we found Commodore Sir Edward Hughes, with his majesty's ships Salisbury and Sea-horse. I saluted
the commodore with, thirteen guns; and, soon after, the garrison with the same number; the former
returned the salute, as usual, with two guns less, and the latter with an equal number.</p><p><date>1774 March-July</date></p><p>On the 24th, Sir Edward Hughes sailed with the Salisbury and Sea-horse, for the East Indies; but
I remained refitting the ship and refreshing the people till the 16th of April, when I sailed for
England, and on the 14th of July anchored at Spithead.</p></div><div type="chapter"><head><l>CHAPTER IX.</l><l><emph>Transactions at the Cape of Good Hope; with an Account of some Discoveries made by the

section, had obliged me to suspend.</p><p>The day after my arrival at the Cape of Good Hope, I went on shore, and waited on the Governor,
Baron Plettenberg, and other principal officers, who received, and, treated us, with the greatest
politeness, contributing all in their power to make it agreeable. And, as there are few people more
obliging to strangers than the Dutch in general, at this place, and refreshments of all kinds are no
where to be got in such abundance, we enjoyed some real repose, after the fatigues of a long
voyage.</p><p>The good treatment which strangers meet with at the Cape of Good Hope, and the necessity of
breathing a little fresh air, has introduced a custom, not common any where else (at least I have no
where seen it so strictly observed), which is, for all the officers, who can be spared out of the
ship, to reside on shore. We followed this custom. Myself, the two Mr Forsters, and Mr Sparrman,
took up our abode with Mr Brandt, a gentleman well known to the English, by his obliging readiness
to serve them. My first care, after my arrival, was to procure fresh-baked bread, fresh meat,
greens, and wine, for those who remained on board; and being provided, every day during our stay,
with these articles, they were soon restored to their usual strength. We had only three men on board
whom it was thought necessary to send on shore for the recovery of their health; and for these I
procured quarters, at the rate of thirty stivers, or half-a-crown, per day, for which they were
provided with victuals, drink, and lodging.</p><p>We now went to work to supply all our defects. For this purpose, by permission, we erected a tent
on shore, to which we sent our casks and sails to be repaired. We also struck the yards and
topmasts, in order to overhaul the rigging, which we found in so bad a condition, that almost every
thing, except the standing rigging, was obliged to be replaced with new, and that was purchased at a
most exorbitant price. In the article of naval stores, the Dutch here, as well as at Batavia, take a
shameful advantage of the distress of foreigners.</p><p>That our rigging, sails, etc. should be worn out, will not be wondered at, when it is known, that
during this circumnavigation of the globe, that is, from our leaving this place to our return to it
again, we had sailed no less than twenty thousand leagues; an extent of voyage nearly equal to three
times the equatorial circumference of the earth, and which, I apprehend, was never sailed by any
ship in the same space of time before. And yet, in all this great run, which had been made in all
latitudes between 9° and 71, we sprung neither low-masts, top-mast, lower, nor top-sail yard, nor so
much as broke a lower or top-mast shroud; which, with the great care and abilities of my officers,
must be owing to the good properties of our ship.</p><p>One of the French ships which were at anchor in the bay, was the Ajax Indiaman, bound to
Pondicherry, commanded by Captain Crozet. He had been second in command with Captain Marion, who
sailed from this place with two ships, in <date>March 1772</date>, as hath been already mentioned. Instead of
going from hence to America, as was said, he stood away for New Zealand; where, in the Bay of Isles,
he and some of his people were killed by the inhabitants. Captain Crozet, who succeeded to the
command, returned by the way of the Phillipine Isles, with the two ships, to the island of
Mauritius. He seemed to be a man possessed of the true spirit of discovery, and to have abilities.
In a very obliging manner he communicated to me a chart, wherein were delineated not only his own
discoveries, but also that of Captain Kerguelen, which I found laid down in the very situation where
we searched for it; so that I can by no means conceive how both we and the Adventure missed it.</p><p>Besides this land, which Captain Crozet told us was a long but very narrow island, extending east
and west, Captain Marion, in about the latitude of <geo select="lat">48° S</geo>outh, and from 16° to 30° of longitude east
of the Cape of Good Hope, discovered six islands, which were high and barren. These, together with
some islands lying between the Line and the southern tropic in the Pacific Ocean, were the principal
discoveries made in this voyage, the account of which, we were told, was ready for publication.</p><p>By Captain Crozet's chart it appeared, that a voyage had been made by the French across the South
Pacific Ocean in 1769, under the command of one Captain Surville; who, on condition of his
attempting discoveries, had obtained leave to make a trading voyage to the coast of Peru. He fitted
out, and took in a cargo, in some part of the East Indies; proceeded by way of the Phillipine Isles;
passed near New Britain; and discovered some land in the latitude of <geo select="lat">10° S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">158° E</geo>ast, to
which he gave his own name. From hence he steered to the south; passed, but a few degrees, to the
west of New Caledonia; fell in with New Zealand at its northern extremity, and put into Doubtful
Bay; where, it seems, he was, when I passed it, on my former voyage in the Endeavour. From New
Zealand Captain Surville steered to the east, between the latitude of<geo select="lat">35° S</geo>  and <geo select="lat">41° S</geo>outh, until he
arrived on the coast of America; where, in the port of Callao, in attempting to land, he was
drowned.</p><p>These voyages of the French, though undertaken by private adventurers, have contributed something
towards exploring the Southern Ocean. That of Captain Surville clears up a mistake which I was led
into, in imagining the shoals off the west end of New Caledonia, to extend to the west as far as New
Holland; it proves that there is an open sea in that space, and that we saw the N.W. extremity of
that country.</p><p>From the same gentleman, we learnt, that the ship which had been at Otaheite before our first
arrival there this voyage, was from New Spain; and that, in her return, she had discovered some
islands in the latitude of <geo select="lat">32° S</geo>., and under the meridian of <geo select="lon">130° W</geo>. Some other islands, said to be
discovered by the Spaniards, appeared on this chart; but Captain Crozet seemed to think they were
inserted from no good authorities.</p><p>We were likewise informed of a later voyage undertaken by the French, under the command of
Captain Kerguelen, which had ended much to the disgrace of that commander.</p><p>While we lay in Table Bay, several foreign ships put in and out, bound to and from India, viz.
English, French, Danes, Swedes, and three Spanish frigates, two of them going to, and one coming
from Manilla. It is but very lately that the Spanish ships have touched here; and these were the
first that were allowed the same privileges as other European friendly nations.</p><p><date>1775 March-April</date></p><p>On examining our rudder, the pintles were found to be loose, and we were obliged to unhang it,
and take it on shore to repair. We were also delayed for want of caulkers to caulk the ship, which
was absolutely necessary to be done before we put to sea. At length I obtained two workmen from one
of the Dutch ships; and the Dutton English East Indiaman coming in from Bengal, Captain Rice obliged
me with two more; so that by the 26th of April this work was finished: And having got on board all
necessary stores, and a fresh supply of provisions and water, we took leave of the governor and
other principal officers, and the next morning repaired on board. Soon after the wind coming fair,
we weighed and put to sea; as did also the Spanish frigate Juno, from Manilla, a Danish Indiaman,
and the Dutton.</p><p>As soon as we were under sail, we saluted the garrison with thirteen guns; which compliment was
immediately returned with the same number. The Spanish frigate and Danish Indiaman both saluted us
as we passed them, and I returned each salute with an equal number of guns. When we were clear of
the bay the Danish ship steered for the East Indies, the Spanish frigate for Europe, and we and the
Dutton for St Helena.</p><p>Depending on the goodness of Mr Kendall's watch, I resolved to try to make the island by a direct
course. For the first six days, that is, till we got into the latitude of <geo select="lat">27° S</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon">11.5°
W</geo>. of the cape, the winds were southerly and S.E. After this we had variable light airs for two
days; they were succeeded by a wind at S.E. which continued to the island, except a part of one day,
when it was at N.E. In general the wind blew faint all the passage, which made it longer than
common.</p><p><date>1775 May</date></p><p>At day-break in the morning of the 15th of May, we saw the island of St Helena at the distance of
fourteen leagues; and at midnight anchored in the road before the town, on the N.W. side of the
island. At sun-rise the next morning, the castle, and also the Dutton, saluted us, each with
thirteen guns; on my landing, soon after, I was saluted by the castle with the same number, and each
of the salutes was returned by the ship.</p><p>Governor Skettowe and the principal gentlemen of the island, received and treated me, during my
stay, with the greatest politeness; by shewing me every kind of civility in their power.</p><p>Whoever views St Helena in its present state, and can but conceive what it must have been
originally, will not hastily charge the inhabitants with want of industry. Though, perhaps, they
might apply it to more advantage, were more land appropriated to planting of corn, vegetables,
roots, etc. instead of being laid out in pasture, which is the present mode. But this is not likely
to happen, so long as the greatest part of it remains in the hands of the company and their
servants. Without industrious planters, this island can never flourish, and be in a condition to
supply the shipping with the necessary refreshments.</p><p>Within these three years a new church has been built; some other new buildings were in hand; a
commodious landing-place for boats has been made; and several other improvements, which add both
strength and beauty to the place.</p><p>During our stay here, we finished some necessary repairs of the ship, which we had not time to do
at the Cape. We also filled all our empty water-casks; and the crew were served with fresh beef,
purchased at five-pence per pound. Their beef is exceedingly good, and is the only refreshment to be
had worth mentioning.</p><p>By a series of observations made at the Cape town, and at James Fort in St Helena, at the former
by Messrs Mason and Dixon, and at the latter by Mr Maskelyne, the astronomer royal, the difference
of longitude between these two places is 24° 12' 15", only two miles more than Mr Kendall's watch
made. The lunar observations made by Mr Wales, before we arrived at the island, and after we left
it, and reduced to it by the watch, gave 5° 51' for the longitude of James Fort; which is only five
miles more west than it is placed by Mr Maskelyne. In like manner the longitude of the Cape Town was
found within 5' of the truth. I mention this to shew how near the longitude of places may be found
by the lunar method, even at sea, with the assistance of a good watch.</p></div><div type="chapter"><head><l>CHAPTER X.</l><l><emph>Passage from St Helena to the Western Islands, with a Description of the Island of
Ascension and Fernando Noronha.</emph></l></head><p><date>1775 May</date></p><p>On the 21st in the evening, I took leave of the governor, and repaired on board. Upon my leaving
the shore, I was saluted with thirteen guns; and upon my getting under sail, with the Dutton in
company, I was saluted with thirteen more; both of which I returned.</p><p>After leaving St Helena, the Dutton was ordered to steer N.W. by W. or N.W. by compass, in order
to avoid falling in with Ascension; at which island, it was said, an illicit trade was carried on
between the officers of the India Company's ships, and some vessels from North America, who, of late
years, had frequented the island on pretence of fishing whales or catching turtle, when their real
design was to wait the coming of the India ships. In order to prevent their homeward-bound ships
from falling in with these smugglers, and to put a stop to this illicit trade, the Dutton was
ordered to steer the course above-mentioned, till to the northward of Ascension. I kept company with
this ship till the 24th, when, after putting a packet on board her for the Admiralty, we parted: She
continuing her course to the N.W., and I steering for Ascension.</p><p>In the morning of the 28th I made the island; and the same evening anchored in Cross Bay on the
N.W. side, in ten fathoms water, the bottom a fine sand, and half a mile from the shore. The Cross
Hill, so called on account of a cross, or flag-staff erected upon it, bore by compass S. 38° E.; and
the two extreme points of the bay extended from N.E. to S.W. We remained here till the evening of
the 31st, and notwithstanding we had several parties out every night, we got but twenty-four turtle,
it being rather too late in the season; however, as they weighed between four or five hundred pounds
each, we thought ourselves not ill off. We might have had a plentiful supply of fish in general,
especially of that sort called Old Wives, of which I have no where seen such abundance. There were
also cavalies, conger eels, and various other sorts; but the catching of any of these was not
attended to, the object being turtle. There are abundance of goats, and aquatic birds, such as
men-of-war and tropic birds, boobies, etc.</p><p>The island of Ascension is about ten miles in length, in the direction of N.W. and S.E., and
about five or six in breadth. It shews a surface composed of barren hills and vallies, on the most
of which not a shrub or plant is to be seen for several miles, and where we found nothing but stones
and sand, or rather flags and ashes; an indubitable sign that the isle, at some remote time, has
been destroyed by a volcano, which has thrown up vast heaps of stones, and even hills. Between these
heaps of stones we found a smooth even surface, composed of ashes and sand, and very good travelling
upon it; but one may as easily walk over broken glass bottles as over the stones. If the foot
deceives you, you are sure to be cut or lamed, which happened to some of our people. A high mountain
at the S.E. end of the isle seems to be left in its original state, and to have escaped the general
destruction. Its soil is a kind of white marl, which yet retains its vegetative qualities, and
produceth a kind of purslain, spurge, and one or two grasses. On these the goats subsist, and it is
at this part of the isle where they are to be found, as also land-crabs, which are said to be very
good.</p><p>I was told, that about this part of the isle is some very good land on which might be raised many
necessary articles; and some have been at the trouble of sowing turnips and other useful vegetables.
I was also told there is a fine spring in a valley which disjoins two hills on the top of the
mountain above-mentioned; besides great quantities of fresh water in holes in the rocks, which the
person who gave me this information, believed was collected from rains. But these supplies of water
can only be of use to the traveller; or to those who may be so unfortunate as to be shipwrecked on
the island; which seems to have been the fate of some not long ago, as appeared by the remains of a
wreck we found on the N.E. side. By what we could judge, she seemed to have been a vessel of about
one hundred and fifty tons burthen.</p><p>While we lay in the road, a sloop of about seventy tons burthen came to an anchor by us. She
belonged to New York, which place she left in February, and having been to the coast of Guinea with
a cargo of goods, was come here to take in turtle to carry to Barbadoes. This was the story which
the master, whose name was Greves, was pleased to tell, and which may, in part, be true. But I
believe the chief view of his coming here, was the expectation of meeting with some of the India
ships. He had been in the island near a week, and had got on board twenty turtle. A sloop, belonging
to Bermuda, had sailed but a few days before with one hundred and five on board, which was as many
as she could take in; but having turned several more on the different sandy beaches, they had ripped
open their bellies, taken out the eggs, and left their carcasses to putrify; an act as inhuman as
injurious to those who came after them. Part of the account I have given of the interior parts of
this island I received from Captain Greves, who seemed to be a sensible intelligent man, and had
been all over it. He sailed in the morning of the same day we did.</p><p>Turtle, I am told, are to be found at this isle from January to June. The method of catching them
is to have people upon the several sandy bays, to watch their coming on shore to lay their eggs,
which is always in the night, and then to turn them on their backs, till there be an opportunity to
take them off the next day. It was recommended to us to send a good many men to each beach, where
they were to lie quiet till the turtle were ashore, and then rise and turn them at once. This method
may be the best when the turtle are numerous; but when there are but few, three or four men are
sufficient for the largest beach; and if they keep patroling it, close to the wash of the surf,
during the night, by this method they will see all that come ashore, and cause less noise than if
there were more of them. It was by this method we caught the most we got; and this is the method by
which the Americans take them. Nothing is more certain, than that all the turtle which are found
about this island, come here for the sole purpose of laying their eggs; for we met with none but
females; and of all those which we caught, not one had any food worth mentioning in its stomach; a
sure sign, in my opinion, that they must have been a long time without any; and this may be the
reason why the flesh of them is not so good as some I have eat on the coast of New South Wales,
which were caught on the spot where they fed.</p><p>The watch made 8° 45' difference of longitude between St Helena and Ascension; which, added to 5°
49' the longitude of James Fort in St Helena, gives 14° 34' for the longitude of the Road of
Ascension, or 14° 30' for the middle of the island, the latitude of which is <geo select="lat">8° S</geo>. The lunar
observations made by Mr Wales, and reduced to the same point of the island by the watch, gave 14°
28' 30" west longitude.</p><p>On the 31st of May, we left Ascension, and steered to the northward with a fine gale at S.E. by
E. I had a great desire to visit the island of St Matthew, to settle its situation; but as I found
the wind would not let me fetch it, I steered for the island of Fernando de Noronha on the coast of
Brazil, in order to determine its longitude, as I could not find this had yet been done. Perhaps I
should have performed a more acceptable service to navigation, if I had gone in search of the island
of St Paul, and those shoals which are said to lie near the equator, and about the meridian of 20°
W.; as neither their situation nor existence are well known. The truth is, I was unwilling to
prolong the passage in searching for what I was not sure to find; nor was I willing to give up every
object, which might tend to the improvement of navigation or geography, for the sake of getting home
a week or a fortnight sooner. It is but seldom that opportunities of this kind offer; and when they
do, they are too often neglected.</p><p>In our passage to Fernando de Noronha, we had steady fresh gales between the S.E. and E.S.E.,
attended with fair and clear weather; and as we had the advantage of the moon, a day or night did
not pass without making lunar observations for determining our longitude. In this run, the variation
of the compass gradually decreased from 11° W., which it was at Ascension., to 1° W., which we found
off Fernando de Noronha. This was the mean result of two compasses, one of which gave 1° 37', and
the other 23' W.</p><p><date>1775 June</date></p><p>On the 9th of June at <time>noon</time> we made the island of Fernando de Noronha, bearing S.W. by W. 1/2 W.,
distant six or seven leagues, as we afterwards found by the log. It appeared in detached and peaked
hills, the largest of which looked like a church tower or steeple. As we drew near the S.E. part of
the isle, we perceived several unconnected sunken rocks lying near a league from the shore, on which
the sea broke in a great surf. After standing very near these rocks, we hoisted our colours, and
then bore up round the north end of the isle, or rather round a group of little islets; for we could
see that the land was divided by narrow channels. There is a strong fort on the one next the main
island, where there are several others; all of which seemed to have every advantage that nature can
give them, and they are so disposed, as wholly to command all the anchoring and landing-places about
the island. We continued to steer round the northern point, till the sandy beaches (before which is
the road for shipping) began to appear, and the forts and the peaked hills were open to the westward
of the said point. At this time, on a gun being fired from one of the forts, the Portuguese colours
were displayed, and the example was followed by all the other forts. As the purpose for which I made
the island was now answered, I had no intention to anchor; and therefore, after firing a gun to
leeward, we made sail and stood away to the northward with a fine fresh gale at E.S.E. The peaked
hill or church tower bore S., <geo select="lon">27° W</geo>., distant about four or five miles; and from this point of view
it leans, or overhangs, to the east. This hill is nearly in the middle of the island, which no where
exceeds two leagues in extent, and shews a hilly unequal surface, mostly covered with wood and
herbage.</p><p>Ulloa says, "This island hath two harbours capable of receiving ships of the greatest burden; one
is on the north side, and the other is on the N.W. The former is, in every respect, the principal,
both for shelter and capacity, and the goodness of its bottom; but both are exposed to the north and
west, though these winds, particularly the north, are periodical, and of no long continuance." He
further says, that you anchor in the north harbour (which is no more than what I would call a road)
to thirteen fathoms water, one-third of a league from shore, bottom of fine sand; the peaked hill
above-mentioned bearing S.W. 2° southerly.*</p><p>[* See Don Antonio d'Ulloa's Book, vol. ii. chap. 3. page 95 to 102, where there is a very
particular account of this island.]</p><p>This road seems to be well sheltered from the south and east winds. One of my seamen had been on
board a Dutch India ship, who put in at this isle in her way out in 1770. They were very sickly, and
in want of refreshments and water. The Portuguese supplied them with some buffaloes and fowls; and
they watered behind one of the beaches in a little pool, which was hardly big enough to dip a bucket
in. By reducing the observed latitude at <time>noon</time> to the peaked hill, its latitude will be <geo select="lat">3° 53' S</geo>.;
and its longitude, by the watch, carried on from St Helena, is <geo select="lon">32° 34' W</geo>.; and by observations of
the sun and moon, made before and after we made the Isle, and reduced to it by the watch, 32° 44'
30" W. This was the mean result of my observations. The results of those made by Mr Wales, which
were more numerous, gave 32° 23'. The mean of the two will be pretty near the watch, and probably
nearest the truth. By knowing the longitude of this isle, we are able to determine that of the
adjacent east coast of Brazil; which, according to the modern charts, lies about sixty or seventy
leagues more to the west. We might very safely have trusted to these charts, especially the
variation chart for 1744, and Mr Dalrymple's of the southern Atlantic ocean*.</p><p>[* Ulloa says, that the chart places this island sixty leagues from the coast of Brazil; and that
the Portuguese pilots, who often make the voyage, judge it to be eighty leagues; but, by taking the
mean between the two opinions, the distance may be fixed at seventy leagues.]</p><p>On the 11th, at <time>three o'clock</time> in the <time>afternoon</time>, we crossed the equator in the longitude of 32°
14' W. We had fresh gales at E.S.E., blowing in squalls, attended by showers of rain, that continued
at certain intervals, till <time>noon</time> the next day, after which we had twenty-four hours fair weather.</p><p>At <time>noon</time> on the 13th, being in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="1">3° 49' N</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">31° 47' W</geo>., the wind became
variable, between the N.E. and S.; and we had light airs and squalls by turns, attended by hard
showers of rain, and for the most part dark gloomy weather, which continued till the evening of the
15th, when, in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="2">5° 47' N</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="2">31° W</geo>., we had three calm days, in which time we
did not advance above ten or twelve leagues to the north. We had fair weather and rain by turns; the
sky, for the most part, being obscured, and sometimes by heavy dense clouds which broke in excessive
hard showers.</p><p>At <time>seven o'clock  in the evening</time> on the 18th, the calm was succeeded by a breeze at east, which
the next day increasing and veering to and fixing at N.E., we stretched to N.W. with our tacks on
board. We made no doubt that we had now got the N.E. trade-wind, as it was attended with fair
weather, except now and then some light showers of rain; and as we advanced to the north the wind
increased, and blew a fresh top-gallant gale.</p><p>On the 21st, I ordered the still to be fitted to the largest copper, which held about sixty-four
gallons. The fire was lighted at <time>four o'clock  in the morning</time>, and at six the still began to run. It
was continued till <time>six o'clock  in the evening</time>; in which time we obtained thirty-two gallons of fresh
water, at the expence of one bushel and a half of coals; which was about three-fourths of a bushel
more than was necessary to have boiled the ship's company's victuals only; but the expence of fuel
was no object with me. The victuals were dressed in the small copper, the other being applied wholly
to the still; and every method was made use of to obtain from it the greatest quantity of fresh
water possible; as this was my sole motive for setting it to work. The mercury in the thermometer at
<time>noon</time> was eighty-four and a half, and higher it is seldom found at sea. Had it been lower, more
water, under the same circumstances, would undoubtedly have been produced; for the colder the air
is, the cooler you can keep the still, which will condense the steam the faster. Upon the whole,
this is an useful invention; but I would advise no man to trust wholly to it. For although you may,
provided you have plenty of fuel and good coppers, obtain as much water as will support life, you
cannot, with all your efforts, obtain sufficient to support health, in hot climates especially,
where it is the most wanting: For I am well convinced, that nothing contributes more to the health
of seamen, than having plenty of water.</p><p>The wind now remained invariably fixed at N.E. and E.N.E., and blew fresh with squalls, attended
with showers of rain, and the sky for the most part cloudy. On the 25th, in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="1">16° 12' N</geo> 
N., longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">37° 20' W</geo>., seeing a ship to windward steering down upon us, we shortened sail in
order to speak with her; but finding she was Dutch by her colours, we made sail again and left her
to pursue her course, which we supposed was to some of the Dutch settlements in the West Indies. In
the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="2">20° N</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="2">39° 45' W</geo>., the wind began to veer to E. by N. and E.; but the
weather remained the same; that is, we continued to have it clear and cloudy by turns, with light
squalls and showers. Our track was between N.W. by N. and N.N.W., till <time>noon</time> on the 28th, after which
our course made good was N. by W., being at this time in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="3">21° 21' N</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="3">40°
6' W</geo>. Afterwards, the wind began to blow a little more steady, and was attended with fair and clear
weather. At <time>two o'clock  in the morning</time> of the 30th, being in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="4">24° 20' N</geo>., longitude
<geo select="lon" n="4">40° 47' W</geo>., a ship, steering to the westward, passed us within hail. We judged her to be English, as
they answered us in that language; but we could not understand what they said, and they were
presently out of sight.</p><p>In the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="1">29° 30' N</geo> , longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">41° 30' W</geo>, the wind slackened and veered more to the S.E. We
now began to see some of that sea-plant, which is commonly called gulph-weed, from a supposition
that it comes from the Gulph of Florida. Indeed, for aught I know to the contrary, it may be a fact;
but it seems not necessary, as it is certainly a plant which vegetates at sea. We continued to see
it, but always in small pieces, till we reached the latitude <geo select="lat" n="2">36° N</geo>, longitude <geo select="lon" n="2">39° W</geo>., beyond which
situation no more appeared.</p><p><date>1775 July</date></p><p>On the 5th of July, in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="1">22° 31.5' N</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="1">40° 29' W</geo>., the wind veered to
the east, and blew very faint: The next day it was calm; the two following days we had variable
light airs and calms by turns; and, at length, on the 9th, having fixed at S.S.W., it increased to a
fresh gale, with which we steered first N.E. and then E.N.E., with a view of making some of the
Azores, or Western Isles. On the 11th, in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="2">36° 45' N</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="2">36° 45' W</geo>., we saw a
sail which was steering to the west; and the next day we saw three more.</p></div><div type="chapter"><head><l>CHAPTER XI.</l><l><emph>Arrival of the Ship at the Island of Fayal, a Description of the Place, and the Return of
the Resolution to England.</emph></l></head><p><date>1775 July</date></p><p>At <time>five o'clock  in the evening</time> of the 13th, we made the island of Fayal, one of the Azores, and
soon after that of Pico, under which we spent the night in making short boards. At day-break the
next morning, we bore away for the bay of Fayal, or De Horta, where at <time>eight o'clock</time>, we anchored in
twenty fathoms water, a clear sandy bottom, and something more than half a mile from the shore. Here
we moored N.E. and S.W., being directed so to do by the master of the port, who came on board before
we dropped anchor. When moored, the S.W. point of the bay bore S. 16° W., and the N.E. point N. 33°
E.; the church at the N.E. end of the town N. 38° W., the west point of St George's Island N. 42°
E., distant eight leagues; and the isle of Pico, extending from N. 74° E. to S. 46° E., distant four
or five miles.</p><p>We found in the bay the Pourvoyeur, a large French frigate, an American sloop, and a brig
belonging to the place. She had come last from the river Amazon, where she took in a cargo of
provision from the Cape Verd Islands; but, not being able to find them, she steered for this place,
where she anchored about half an hour before us.</p><p>As my sole design in stopping here was to give Mr Wales an opportunity to find the rate of the
watch, the better to enable us to fix with some degree of certainty the longitude of these islands,
the moment we anchored, I sent an officer to wait on the English consul, and to notify our arrival
to the governor, requesting his permission for Mr Wales to make observations on shore, for the
purpose above mentioned. Mr Dent, who acted as consul in the absence of Mr Gathorne, not only
procured this permission, but accommodated Mr Wales with a convenient place in his garden to set up
his instruments; so that he was enabled to observe equal altitudes the same day.</p><p>We were not more obliged to Mr Dent for the very friendly readiness he shewed in procuring us
this and every other thing we wanted, than for the very liberal and hospitable entertainment we met
with at his house, which was open to accommodate us both night and day.</p><p>During our stay, the ship's company was served with fresh beef; and we took on board about
fifteen tons of water, which we brought off in the country boats, at the rate of about three
shillings per ton. Ships are allowed to water with their own boats; but the many inconveniencies
attending it, more than overbalance the expence of hiring shore-boats, which is the most general
custom.</p><p>Fresh provisions for present use may be got, such as beef, vegetables, and fruit; and hogs,
sheep, and poultry for sea stock, all at a pretty reasonable price; but I do not know that any
sea-provisions are to be had, except wine. The bullocks and hogs are very good, but the sheep are
small and wretchedly poor.</p><p>The principal produce of Fayal is wheat and Indian corn, with which they supply Pico and some of
the other isles. The chief town is called Villa de Horta. It is situated in the bottom of the bay,
close to the edge of the sea, and is defended by two castles, one at each end of the town, and a
wall of stone-work, extending along the sea-shore from the one to the other. But these works are
suffered to go to decay, and serve more for shew than strength. They heighten the prospect of the
city, which makes a fine appearance from the road; but, if we except the Jesuits' college, the
monasteries and churches, there is not another building that has any thing to recommend it, either
outside or in. There is not a glass window in the place, except what are in the churches, and in a
country-house which lately belonged to the English consul; all the others being latticed, which, to
an Englishman, makes them look like prisons.</p><p>This little city, like all others belonging to the Portuguese, is crowded with religious
buildings, there being no less than three convents of men and two of women, and eight churches,
including those belonging to the convents, and the one in the Jesuits' college. This college is a
fine structure, and is situated on an elevation in the pleasantest part of the city. Since the
expulsion of that order, it has been suffered to go to decay, and will probably, in a few years, be
no better than a heap of ruins.</p><p>Fayal, although the most noted for wines, does not raise sufficient for its own consumption. This
article is raised on Pico, where there is no road for shipping; but being brought to De Horta, and
from thence shipped abroad, chiefly to America, it has acquired the name of Fayal Wine.</p><p>The bay, or road of Fayal, is situated at the east end of the isle, before the Villa de Horta,
and facing the west end of Pico. It is two miles broad, and three quarters of a mile deep, and hath
a semi-circular form. The depth of water is from twenty to ten and even six fathoms, a sandy bottom,
except near the shore, and particularly near the S.W. head, off which the bottom is rocky, also
without the line which joins the two points of the bay, so that it is not safe to anchor far out.
The bearing before mentioned, taken when at anchor, will direct any one to the best ground. It is by
no means a bad road, but the winds most to be apprehended, are those which blow from between the
S.S.W. and S.E.; the former is not so dangerous as the latter, because, with it, you can always get
to sea. Besides this road, there is a small cove round the S.W. point, called Porto Pierre, in
which, I am told, a ship or two may lie in tolerable safety, and where they sometimes heave small
vessels down.</p><p>A Portuguese captain told me, that about half a league from the road in the direction of S.E., in
a line between it and the south side of Pico, lies a sunken rock, over which is twenty-two feet
water, and on which the sea breaks in hard gales from the south. He also assured me, that of all the
shoals that are laid down in our charts and pilot-books about these isles, not one has any existence
but the one between the islands of St Michael and St Mary, called Hormingan. This account may be
believed, without relying entirely upon it. He further informed me, that it is forty-five leagues
from Fayal to the island of Flores; and that there runs a strong tide between Fayal and Pico, the
flood setting to the N.E. and the ebb to the S.W., but that, out at sea, the direction is E. and W.
Mr Wales having observed the times of high and low water by the shore, concluded that it must be
high water at the full and change, about <time>twelve o'clock</time>, and the water riseth about four or five
feet.</p><p>The distance between Fayal and Flores was confirmed by Mr Rebiers, lieutenant of the French
frigate, who told me, that after being by estimation two leagues due south of Flores, they made
forty-four leagues on a S.E. by E. course by compass, to St Catherine's Point on Fayal.</p><p><table rows="7" cols="2"><row><cell> I found the latitude of the ship at anchor in the bay</cell><cell><geo select="lat" n="1">38° 31' N</geo>55".</cell></row><row><cell> By a mean of seventeen sets of lunar observations, and reduced to the bay by the watch, the

the ship, to agree very well with the like observations made by Mr Wales on shore; and yet the
variation thus found is greater by 5° than we found it to be at sea, for the azimuths taken on board
the evening before we came into the bay, gave no more than 16° 18' W. variation, and the evening
after we came out 17° 33' W.</p><p>I shall now give some account of the variation, as observed in our run from the island of
Fernando De Noronha to Fayal. The least variation we found was 37' W. which was the day after we
left Fernando De Noronha, and in the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="1">0° 33' S</geo><!--EB-B NOTE TO MATTIA: At this point, they're at the Equator,

nearly in the same longitude, and in the latitude of <geo select="lat">1° 25' N</geo>., it was 1° 23' W.; and we did not
find it increase till we got into the latitude of <geo select="lat" n="2">5° N</geo>., longitude <geo select="lon" n="2">31° W</geo>. After this our compasses

was 14° 47'; and in sight of Fayal 16° 18' W.<!--EB-B: I'm pretty sure this is a variation reading.-->, as mentioned above.</p><p>Having left the bay, at four in the morning of the 19th, I steered for the west end of St
George's Island. As soon as we had passed it, I steered E. 1/2 S. for the Island of Tercera; and
after having run thirteen leagues, we were not more than one league from the west end. I now edged
away for the north side, with a view of ranging the coast to the eastern point, in order to
ascertain the length of the island; but the weather coming on very thick and hazy, and night
approaching, I gave up the design, and proceeded with all expedition for England.</p><p>On the 29th, we made the land near Plymouth. The next morning we anchored at Spithead; and the
same day I landed at Portsmouth, and set out for London, in company with Messrs Wales, Forsters, and
Hodges.</p><p>Having been absent from England three years and eighteen days, in which time, and under all
changes of climate, I lost but four men, and only one of them by sickness, it may not be amiss, at
the conclusion of this journal, to enumerate the several causes to which, under the care of
Providence, I conceive this uncommon good state of health, experienced by my people, was owing.</p><p>In the Introduction, mention has been made of the extraordinary attention paid by the Admiralty
in causing such articles to be put on board, as either from experience or suggestion it was judged
would tend to preserve the health of the seamen. I shall not trespass upon the reader's time in
mentioning them all, but confine myself to such as were found the most useful.</p><p>We were furnished with a quantity of malt, of which was made <emph>Sweet Wort</emph>. To such of
the men as shewed the least symptoms of the scurvy, and also to such as were thought to be
threatened with that disorder, this was given, from, one to two or three pints a-day each man; or in
such proportion as the surgeon found necessary, which sometimes amounted to three quarts. This is,
without doubt, one of the best anti-scorbutic sea-medicines yet discovered; and, if used in time,
will, with proper attention to other things, I am persuaded, prevent the scurvy from making any
great progress for a considerable while. But I am not altogether of opinion that it will cure it at
sea.</p><p><emph>Sour Krout</emph>, of which we had a large quantity, is not only a wholesome vegetable
food, but, in my judgment, highly antiscorbutic; and it spoils not by keeping. A pound of this was
served to each man, when at sea, twice-a-week, or oftener, as was thought necessary.</p><p><emph>Portable Broth</emph> was another great article, of which we had a large supply. An ounce
of this to each man, or such other proportion as circumstances pointed out, was boiled in their
pease, three days in the week; and when we were in places where vegetables were to be got, it was
boiled with them, and wheat or oatmeal, every morning for breakfast; and also with pease and
vegetables for dinner. It enabled us to make several nourishing and wholesome messes, and was the
means of making the people eat a greater quantity of vegetables than they would otherwise have
done.</p><p><emph>Rob of Lemon and Orange</emph> is an antiscorbutic we were not without. The surgeon made
use of it in many cases with great success.</p><p>Amongst the articles of victualling, we were supplied with <emph>Sugar</emph> in the room of
<emph>Oil</emph>, and with <emph>Wheat</emph> for a part of our <emph>Oatmeal</emph>; and were
certainly gainers by the exchange. Sugar, I apprehend, is a very good antiscorbutic; whereas oil
(such as the navy is usually supplied with), I am of opinion, has the contrary effect.</p><p>But the introduction of the most salutary articles, either as provisions or medicines, will
generally prove unsuccessful, unless supported by certain regulations. On this principle, many years
experience, together with some hints I had from Sir Hugh Palliser, Captains Campbell, Wallis, and
other intelligent officers, enabled me to lay a plan, whereby all was to be governed.</p><p>The crew were at three watches, except upon some extraordinary occasions. By this means they were
not so much exposed to the weather as if they had been at watch and watch; and had generally dry
clothes to shift themselves, when they happened to get wet. Care was also taken to expose them as
little to wet weather as possible.</p><p>Proper methods were used to keep their persons, hammocks, bedding, cloaths, etc. constantly clean
and dry. Equal care was taken to keep the ship clean and dry betwixt decks. Once or twice a week she
was aired with fires; and when this could not be done, she was smoked with gun-powder, mixed with
vinegar or water. I had also, frequently, a fire made in an iron pot, at the bottom of the well,
which was of great use in purifying the air in the lower parts of the ship. To this, and to
cleanliness, as well in the ship as amongst the people, too great attention cannot be paid; the
least neglect occasions a putrid and disagreeable smell below, which nothing but fires will
remove.</p><p>Proper attention was paid to the ship's coppers, so that they were kept constantly clean.</p><p>The fat which boiled out of the salt beef and pork, I never suffered to be given to the people;
being of opinion that it promotes the scurvy.</p><p>I was careful to take in water wherever it was to be got, even though we did not want it, because
I look upon fresh water from the shore to be more wholesome than that which has been kept some time
on board a ship. Of this essential article we were never at an allowance, but had always plenty for
every necessary purpose. Navigators in general cannot, indeed, expect, nor would they wish to meet
with such advantages in this respect, as fell to my lot. The nature of our voyage carried us into
very high latitudes. But the hardships and dangers inseparable from that situation, were in some
degree compensated by the singular felicity we enjoyed, of extracting inexhaustible supplies of
fresh water from an ocean strewed with ice.</p><p>We came to few places, where either the art of man, or the bounty of nature, had not provided
some sort of refreshment or other, either in the animal or vegetable way. It was my first care to
procure whatever of any kind could be met with, by every means in my power; and to oblige our people
to make use thereof, both by my example and authority; but the benefits arising from refreshments of
any kind soon became so obvious, that I had little occasion, to recommend the one, or to exert the
other.</p><p>It doth not become me to say how far the principal objects of our voyage have been obtained.
Though it hath not abounded with remarkable events, nor been diversified by sudden transitions of
fortune; though my relation of it has been more employed in tracing our course by sea, than in
recording our operations on shore; this, perhaps, is a circumstance from which the curious reader
may infer, that the purposes for which we were sent into the Southern Hemisphere, were diligently
and effectually pursued. Had we found out a continent there, we might have been better enabled to
gratify curiosity; but we hope our not having found it, after all our persevering researches, will
leave less room for future speculation about unknown worlds remaining to be explored.</p><p>But, whatever may be the public judgment about other matters, it is with real satisfaction, and
without claiming any merit but that of attention to my duty, that I can conclude this account with
an observation, which facts enable me to make; that our having discovered the possibility of
preserving health amongst a numerous ship's company, for such a length of time, in such varieties of
climate, and amidst such continued hardships and fatigues, will make this voyage remarkable in the
opinion of every benevolent person, when the disputes about a Southern Continent shall have ceased
to engage the attention, and to divide the judgment of philosophers.</p></div><div type="Appendices"><div type="Appendix"><head><l>(Tables of the route of the Resolution and the Adventure, the variation of the compass and

(which represent the sound that conveys the idea,) have some particular method of managing, or
pronouncing, the sounds represented by such characters, this forms a very essential article in the
constitution of the language of any particular nation, and must, therefore, be understood before we
can make any progress in learning, or be able to converse in it. But as this is very complex and
tedious to a beginner, by reason of the great variety of powers the characters, or letters, are
endued with under different circumstances, it would seem necessary, at least in languages which have
never before appeared in writing, to lessen the number of these varieties, by restraining the
different sounds, and always representing the same simple ones by the same character; and this is no
less necessary in the English than any other language, as this variety of powers is very frequent,
and without being taken notice of in the following Vocabulary, might render it entirely
unintelligible. As the vowels are the regulations of all sounds, it is these only that need be
noticed, and the powers allotted to each of these in the Vocabulary is subjoined.</p><p><emph>A</emph> in the English language is used to represent two different simple sounds, as in
the word Arabia, where the first and last have a different power from the second. In the Vocabulary
this letter must always have the power, or be pronounced like the first and last in Arabia. The
other power, or sound, of the second <emph>a</emph>, is always represented in the Vocabulary by
<emph>a</emph> and <emph>i</emph>, printed in Italics thus, <emph>ai</emph>.</p><p><emph>E</emph> has likewise two powers, or it is used to represent two simple sounds, as in the
words Eloquence, Bred, Led, etc. and it may be said to have a third power, as in the words Then,
When, etc. In the first case, this letter is only used at the beginning of words, and wherever it is
met with in any other place in the words of the Vocabulary, it is used as in the second case: But
never as in the third example; for this power, or sound, is every where expressed by the
<emph>a</emph> and <emph>i</emph> before-mentioned, printed in Italics.</p><p><emph>I</emph> is used to express different simple sounds, as in the words Indolence, Iron, and
Imitation. In the Vocabulary it is never used as in the first case, but in the middle of words; it
is never used as in the second example, for that sound is always represented by <emph>y</emph>, nor
is it used as in the last case, that sound being always represented by two <emph>e</emph>'s, printed
in Italics in this manner, <emph>ee</emph>.</p><p><emph>O</emph> never alters in the pronunciation, i.e. in this Vocabulary, of a simple sound, but
is often used in this manner, <emph>oo</emph>, and sounds as in Good, Stood, etc.</p><p><emph>U</emph> alters, or is used to express different simple sounds, as in Unity, or Umbrage.
Here the letters <emph>e</emph> and <emph>u</emph>, printed in Italics <emph>eu</emph> are used to
express its power as in the first example, and it always retains the second power, wherever it is
met with.</p><p><emph>Y</emph> is used to express different sounds, as in My, By, etc. etc. and in Daily, Fairly,
etc. Wherever it is met with in the middle, or end, (i.e. anywhere but at the beginning,) of a word,
it is to be used as in the first example; but is never to be found as in the second, for that sound,
or power, is always represented by the Italic letter <emph>e</emph>. It has also a third power, as
in the words Yes, Yell, etc., which is retained every where in the Vocabulary, at least in the
beginning of words, or when it goes before another vowel, unless directed to be sounded separately
by a mark over it, as thus, ÿ a.</p><p>Unless in a few instances, these powers of the vowels are used throughout the Vocabulary; but, to
make the pronunciation still less liable to change, or variation, a few marks are added to the
words, as follows:—</p><p>This mark ¨ as öa, means that these letters are to be expressed singly.</p><p>The letters in Italic, as <emph>ee</emph>, or <emph>oo</emph>, make but one simple sound.</p><p>When a particular stress is laid on any part of a word in the pronunciation, an accent is placed
over that letter where it begins, or rather between that and the preceding one.</p><p>It often happens that a word is compounded as it were of two, or in some cases the same word, or
syllable, is repeated. In these circumstances, a comma is placed under them at this division, where
a rest, or small space, of time is left before you proceed to pronounce the other part, but it must
not be imagined that this is a full stop.</p><p><emph>Examples in all these Cases.</emph></p><p> Röa, Great, long, distant. E'r_ee_ma, Five. Ry'po_ee_a, Fog, <emph>or mist</emph>. E'h_oo_ra, To

judgment of your Council, in the disposal of Sir Godfrey Copley's medal; an office I have undertaken
at their request, and with the greater satisfaction, as I am confident you will be no less unanimous
in giving your approbation, than they have been in addressing you for it upon this occasion. For
though they were not insensible of the just title that several of the Papers, composing the present
volume of your Transactions, had to your particular notice, yet they did not hesitate in preferring
that which I presented to you from Captain Cook, giving An account of the method he had taken to
preserve the health of the crew of his Majesty's ship the Resolution during her late voyage round
the world*. Indeed I imagine that the name alone of so worthy a member of this society would have
inclined you to depart from the strictness of your rules, by conferring upon him that honour, though
you had received no direct communication from him; considering how meritorious in your eyes that
person must appear, who hath not only made the most extensive, but the most instructive voyages; who
hath not only discovered, but surveyed, vast tracts of new coasts; who hath dispelled the illusion
of a terra australis incognita, and fixed the bounds of the habitable earth, as well as those of the
navigable ocean, in the southern hemisphere.</p><p>[* The paper itself, read at the Society in March last, with an extract of a letter from Captain
Cook to the President, dated Plymouth, the 7th of July following, are both subjoined to this
discourse.]</p><p>I shall not, however, expatiate on that ample field of praise, but confine my discourse to what
was the intention of this honorary premium, namely, to crown that Paper of the year which should
contain the most useful and most successful experimental inquiry. Now what inquiry can be so useful
as that which hath for its object the saving the lives of men? And when shall we find one more
successful than that before us? Here are no vain boastings of the empiric, nor ingenious and
delusive theories of the dogmatist; but a concise, an artless, and an incontested relation of the
means, by which, under the Divine favour, Captain Cook, with a company of an hundred and eighteen
men*, performed a voyage of three years and eighteen days, throughout all the climates, from
fifty-two degrees north, to seventy-one degrees south, with the loss of only one man by a
distemper**. What must enhance to us the value of these salutary observations, is to see the
practice hath been no less simple than efficacious.</p><p>[* There were on board, in all, one hundred and eighteen men, including M. Sparrman, whom they
took in at the Cape of Good Hope.] </p><p>[** This was a phthisis pulmonalis terminating in a dropsy. Mr. Patten, surgeon to the
Resolution, who mentioned to me this case, observed that this man began so early to complain of a
cough and other consumptive symptoms, which had never left him, that his lungs must have been
affected before he came on board.]</p><p>I would now inquire of the most conversant in the study of bills of mortality, whether in the
most healthful climate, and in the best condition of life, they have ever found so small a number of
deaths in such a number of men, within that space of time? How great and agreeable then must our
surprise be, after perusing the histories of long navigations in former days, when so many perished
by marine diseases, to find the air of the sea acquitted of all malignity, and in fine that a voyage
round the world may be undertaken with less danger to health than a common tour in Europe!</p><p>But the better to see the contrast between the old and the present times, allow me to recal to
your memory what you have read of the first voyage for the establishment of the East-India,
Company*. The equipment consisting of four ships, with four hundred and eighty men, three of those
vessels were so weakened by the scurvy, by the time they had got only three degrees beyond the Line,
that the merchants, who had embarked on this adventure, were obliged to do duty as common sailors;
and there died in all, at sea, and on shore at Soldania (a place of refreshment on this side the
Cape of Good Hope) one hundred and five men, which was near a fourth part of their complement. And
hath not Sir Richard Hawkins, an intelligent as well as brave officer, who lived in that age,
recorded, that in twenty years, during which be had used the sea, be could give an account of ten
thousand mariners who bad been consumed by the scurvy alone**? Yet so far was this author from
mistaking the disease, that I have perused few who have so well described it. If then in those early
times, the infancy I may call them of the commerce and naval power of England, so many were carried
off by that bane of sea-faring people, what must have been the destruction afterwards, upon the
great augmentation of the fleet and the opening of so many new ports to the trade of Great Britain,
whilst so little advancement was made in the nautical part of medicine!</p><p>[* This squadron under the command of LANCASTER (who was called the General) set out in the year
1601. See Purchas's Pilgr. vol. i. p. 147, et seq.]</p><p>[** Idem, vol. iv. p. 1373, et seq.]</p><p>But passing from these old dates to one within the remembrance of many here present, when it
might have been expeded that whatever tended to aggrandize the naval power of Britain, and to extend
her commerce, would have received the highest improvement; yet we shall find, that even at this late
period few measures had been taken to preserve the health of seamen, more than had been known to our
uninstructed ancestors. Of this assertion the victorious, but mournful, expedition of Commodore
Anson, affords too convincing a proof. It is well known that soon after passing the Streights of Le
Maire, the scurvy began to appear in his squadron; that by the time the Centurion had advanced but a
little way into the South Sea, forty-seven had died of it in his ship; and that there were few on
board who had not, in some degree, been afflicted with the distemper, though they had not been then
eight months from England. That in the ninth month, when standing for the island of Juan Fernandez,
the Centurion lost double that number; and that the mortality went on at so great a rate (I still
speak of the Commodore's ship) that before they arrived there she had buried two hundred; and at
last could muster no more than six of the the common men in a watch capable of doing duty. This was
the condition of one of the three ships which reached that island; the other two suffered in
proportion.</p><p>Nor did the tragedy end here for after a few months respite the same fatal sickness broke out
afresh, and made such havock, that before the Centurion (which now contained the whole surviving
crew of the three ships) had got to the island of Tinian, there died sometimes eight or ten in a
day; insomuch that when they had been only two years on their voyage, they had lost a larger
proportion than of four in five of their original number; and, by the account of the historian, all
of them, after their entering the South Sea, of the scurvy. I say by the account of the elegant
writer of this voyage; for as he neither was in the medical line himself, nor hath authenticated
this part of his narrative by appealing to the surgeons of the ship or their journals, I should
doubt that this was not strictly the case; but rather, that in producing this great mortality, a
pestilential kind of distemper was joined to the scurvy, which, from the places where it most
frequently occurs, hath been distinguished by the name of jail or hospital-fever*. But whether the
scurvy alone, or this fever combined with it, were the cause, it is not at present material to
inquire, since both, arising from foul air and other sources of putrefaction, may now in a great
measure be obviated by the various means fallen upon since Lord Anson's expedition. For in justice
to that prudent as well as brave commander, it must be observed that the arrangements preparatory to
his voyage were not made by himself; that his ship was so deeply laden as not to admit of opening
the gun-ports, except in the calmest weather, for the benefit of air; and that nothing appears to
have been neglected by him, for preserving the health of his men, that was then known and practised
in the navy.</p><p>[* Dr. Mead, who had seen the original observations of two of Commodore Anson's surgeons, says,
that the scurvy at that time was accompanied with putrid fevers, etc. See his Treatise on the
Scurvy, p. 98. et seq.]</p><p>I should now proceed to enumerate the chief improvements made since that period, and which have
enabled our ships to make so many successful circumnavigations, as in a manner to efface the
impression of former disasters; but as I have mentioned the sickness most destructive to mariners,
and against the ravages of which those preservatives have been mainly contrived, it may be proper
briefly to explain its nature, and the rather as, unless among mariners, it is little understood.
First then, I would observe that the scurvy is not the ailment which goes by that name on shore. The
distemper commonly, but erroneously, in this place, called the scurvy, belongs to a class of
diseases totally different from what we are now treating of; and so far is the commonly received
opinion, that there are few constutions altogether free from a scorbutic taint, from being true,
that unless among sailors and some others circumstanced like them, more particularly with respect to
those who use a salt and putrid diet, and especially if they live in foul air and uncleanliness, I
have reason to believe there are few disorders less frequent. This opinion I submitted to the
judgment of the society several years ago, and I have had no reason since to alter it. I then said,
contrary to what was generally believed, but seemingly on the best grounds, that the sea-air was
never the cause of the scurvy, since on board a ship, on the longest voyages, cleanliness,
ventilation, and fresh provisions, would preserve from it; and that upon a sea-coast, free from
marshes, the inhabitants were not liable to that indisposition, though frequently breathing the air
from the sea*. I concluded with joining in sentiments with those who ascribed the scurvy to a septic
resolution, that is a beginning corruption of the whole habit, similar to that of every animal
substance when deprived of life**. This account seemed to be sufficiently verified by the
examination of the symptoms in the scorbutic sick, and of the appearances in their bodies after
death***. On that occasion I remarked, that salted meats after some time become in effect putrid,
though they may continue long palatable by means of the salt; and that common salt, supposed to be
one of the strongest preservatives from corruption, is at best but an indifferent one, even in a
large quantity; and in a small one, such as we use at table with fresh meats, or swallow in meats
that have been salted, so far from impeding putrefaction, it rather promotes that process in the
body.</p><p>[* Diseases of the Army, part I. ch. 2. Append. Pap. 7.]</p><p>[** Woodall's Surgeon's Mate, p. 163. Poupart. Mem. de l'Acad. R. des Sc. A. 1'99. Petit. Mal.
des Os, tom. II.p. 446. Mead on the Scurvy, p. 104.] </p><p>This position concerning the putrefying quality of sea-salt, in certain proportions, hath been
since confirmed by the experiments of the late Mr. Canton, Fellow of this Society, in his Paper on
the Cause of the luminous appearance of sea-water*.</p><p>[* Phil. Transact. vol. lix. p. 446.]</p><p>It hath been alleged, that the scurvy is much owing to the coldness of the air, which checks
perspiration, and on that account is the endemic distemper of the northern nations, particularly of
those around the Baltic*. The fact is partly true, but I doubt not so the cause. In those regions,
by the long and severe winters, the cattle destitute of pasture can barely live, and are therefore
unfit for use; so that the people, for their provision during that season, are obliged to slaughter
them by the end of autumn, and to salt them for above half the year. This putrid diet then, on which
they must subsist so long, and to which the inhabitants of the south are not reduced, seems to be
the chief cause of the disease. And if we reflect that the lower people of the north have few or no
greens nor fruit in the winter, scarce any fermented liquors, and often live in damp, foul, and
ill-aired houses, it is easy to conceive how they should become liable to the same distemper with
seamen; whilst others of as high a latitude, but who live in a different manner, keep free from it.
Thus we are informed by Linnaeus, that the Laplanders, one of the most hyperborean nations, know
nothing of the scurvy*; for which no other reason can be assigned than their never eating salted
meats, nor indeed salt with any thing, but their using all the winter the fresh flesh of their
rain-deer.</p><p>[* Bartholin. Med. Danor. Domestic p. 98.]</p><p>[** Linnaei Flora Lapponica, p. 8, 9.]</p><p>This exemption of the Laplanders from the general distemper of the north is the more observable,
as they seldom taste vegetables, bread never, as we farther learn from that celebrated author. Yet
in the very provinces which border on Lapland, where they use bread, but scarcely any other
vegetable, and eat salted meats, they are as much troubled with the scurvy as in any other country*.
But let us incidentally remark, that the late improvements in agriculture, gardening, and the other
arts of life, by extending their influence to the remotest parts of Europe, and to the lowest
people, begin sensibly to lessen the frequency of that complaint, even in those climates that have
been once the most afflicted with it.</p><p>[* Linnaeus in several parts of his work confirms what is here said of salted meats, as one of
the chief causes of the scurvy. See Amoenitat. Acad. vol. v. p. 6. et seq. p. 42.]</p><p>It hath also been asserted, that men living on shore will be affected with the scurvy, though
they have never been confined to salted meats; but of this I have never known any instance, except
in those who breathed a marshy air, or what was otherwise putrid, and who wanted exercise, fruits,
and green vegetables: under such circumstances it must be granted, that the humours will corrupt in
the same manner, though not in the same degree, with those of mariners. Thus, in the late war, when
Sisinghurst Castle in Kent was filled with French prisoners, the scurvy broke out among them,
notwithstanding they had never been served with salted victuals in England; but had daily had an
allowance of fresh meat, and of bread in proportion, though without greens or any other vegetable.
The surgeon who attended them, and from whom I received this information, having formerly been
employed in the navy, was the better able to judge of the disorder and to cure it. Besides the
deficiency of herbs, he observed that the wards were foul and crowded, the house damp (from a moat
that surrounded it) and that the bounds allotted for taking the air were so small, and in wet
weather so sloughy, that the men seldom went out. He added, that a representation having been made,
he had been empowered to furnish the prisoners with roots and greens for boiling in their soup, and
to quarter the sick in a neighbouring village in a dry situation, with liberty to go out for air and
exercise; and that by these means they had all quickly recovered. It is probable, that the scurvy
sooner appeared among these strangers, from their having been taken at sea, and consequently more
disposed to the disease. My informer further acquainted me, that in the lower and wetter parts of
that county, where some of his practice lay, he had now and then met with slighter cases of the
scurvy among the common people; such, he said, as lived the whole winter on salted bacon, without
fermented liquors, greens, or fruit, a few apples excepted; but, he remarked, that in the winters
following a plentiful growth of apples, those peasants were visibly less liable to the disorder.</p><p>I have dwelt the longer on this part of my subject, as I look upon the knowledge of the nature
and cause of the scurvy to be an essential step towards improving the means of prevention and cure.
And I am persuaded, after mature reflection, and the opportunities I have had of conversing with
those who, to much sagacity, had joined no small experience in nautical practice, that upon an
examination of the several articles, which have either been of old approven, or have of late been
introduced into the navy, it will be evident, that though these means may vary in form, and in their
mode of operating; yet they all some way contribute towards preventing or correcting putrefaction,
whether of the air in the closer parts of a ship, of the meats, of the water, of the clothes and
bedding, or of the body itself. And if in this inquiry (which may be made by the way, whilst we take
a review of the principal articles of provision, and other methods used by Captain Cook to guard
against the scurvy) I say, if in this inquiry it shall appear, that the notion of a septic or putrid
origin, is not without foundation, it will be no small encouragement to proceed on that principle,
in order further to improve this important branch of medicine.</p><p>Captain Cook begins his list of stores with malt. Of this, he says, was made Sweet Wort, and
given not only to those men who had manifest symptoms of the scurvy, but to such also as were judged
to be most liable to it. Dr. Macbride, who first suggested this preparation, was led (as he says) to
the discovery by some experiments that had been laid before this Society; by which it appeared that
the air produced by alimentary fermentation was endowed with a power of correcting putrefaction*.
The fact he confirmed by numerous trials, and finding this fluid to be <emph>fixed air</emph>, he
justly concluded, that whatever substance proper for food abounded with it, and which could be
conveniently carried to sea, would make one of the best provisions against the scurvy; which he then
considered as a putrid disease, and as such to be prevented or cured by that powerful kind of
antiseptic**. Beer, for instance, had always been esteemed one of the best antiscorbutics; but as
that derived all its fixed air from the malt of which it is made, he inferred that malt itself was
preferable in long voyages, as it took up less room than the brewed liquor, and would keep longer
found. Experience hath since verified this ingenious theory, and the malt hath now gained so much
credit in the navy, that there only wanted so long, so healthful, and so celebrated a voyage as
this, to rank it among the most indispensable articles of provision. For though Captain Cook
remarks, that <emph>A proper attention to other things must be joined, and that he is not altogether
of opinion, that the wort will be able to cure the scurvy in an advanced state at sea; yet he is
persuaded that it is sufficient to prevent that distemper from making any great progress, for a
considerable time</emph>; and therefore he doth not hesitate to pronounce it _one of the best
antiscorbutic medicines yet found out***.</p><p>[* Append. to my <emph>Observations on the Diseases of the Army</emph>.]</p><p>[** Macbride's Exper. Eff. passim.]</p><p>[*** Having been favoured with a sight of the medical journal of Mr. Patten, surgeon to the
Resolution, I read the following passage in it, not a little strengthening the above testimony.
<emph>I have found the wort of the utmost service in all scorbutic cases during the voyage. As many
took it by way of prevention, few cases occurred where it had a fair trial; but theft, however, I
flatter myself, will he sufficient to convince every impartial person, that it is the best remedy
hitherto found out for the cure of the sea scurvy: and I am well convinced, from what I have seen
the wort perform, and from its mode of operation, that if aided by portable-soup, sour krout, sugar,
sago, and courants, then scurvy, that maritime pestilence, will seldom or never make its alarming
appearance among a ship's crew, on the longest voyages; proper care with regard to cleanliness and
provisions being observed</emph>.]</p><p>This salutary gas (or <emph>fixed air</emph>) is contained more or less in all fermentable
liquors, and begins to oppose putrefaction as soon as the working or intestine motion commences.</p><p>In wine it abounds, and perhaps no vegetable substance is more replete with it than the juice of
the grape. If we join the grateful taste of wine, we must rank it the first in the list of
antiscorbutic liquors. Cyder is likewise good, with other vinous productions from fruit, as also the
various kinds of beer. It hath been a constant observation, that in long cruizes or distant voyages,
the scurvy is never seen whilst the small-beer holds out, at a full allowance; but that when it is
all expended, that ailment soon appears. It were therefore to be wished, that this most wholesome
beverage could be renewed at sea; but our ships afford not sufficient convenience. The Russians
however make a shift to prepare on board, as well as at land, a liquor of a middle quality between
wort and small-beer, in the following manner. They take ground-malt and rye-meal in a certain
proportion, which they knead into small loaves, and bake in the oven. These they occasionally infuse
in a proper quantity of warm water, which begins so soon to ferment, that in the space of
twenty-four hours their brewage is completed, in the production of a small, brisk, and acidulous
liquor, they call <emph>quas</emph>, palatable to themselves, and not disagreeable to the taste of
strangers. The late Dr. Mounsey, fellow of this Society, who had lived long in Russia, and had been
<emph>Archiater</emph> under two successive sovereigns, acquainted me, that the <emph>quas</emph>
was the common and wholesome drink both of the fleets and armies of that empire, and that it was
particularly good against the scurvy. He added, that happening to be at Moscow when he perused my
<emph>Observations on the Jail and Hospital Fever</emph>, then lately published*, he had been
induced to compare what he read in that treatise with what he should see in the several prisons of
that large city: but to his surprize, after visiting them all, and finding them full of malefactors
(for the late Empress then suffered none of those who were convicted of capital crimes to be put to
death) yet he could discover no fever among them, nor learn that any acute distemper peculiar to
jails had ever been known there. He observed, that some of those places of confinement had a yard,
into which the prisoners were allowed to come for the air; but that there were others without that
advantage, yet not sickly: so that he could assign no other reason for the healthful condition of
those men than the kind of diet they used, which was the same with that of the common people of the
country; who not being able to purchase fresh-meat, live mostly on rye-bread (the most acescent of
any) and drink <emph>quas</emph>. He concluded with saying, that upon his return to St. Petersburg
he had made the same inquiry there, and with the same result.</p><p>[* That treatise was first published by itself, and afterwards incorporated with the
<emph>Observations on the Diseases of the Army</emph>.]</p><p>Thus far Dr. Mounsey, from whose account it would seem, that the rye-meal assisted both in
quickening the fermentation and adding more <emph>fixed air</emph>, since the malt alone could not
so readily produce so tart and brisk a liquor. And there is little doubt but that whenever the other
grains can be brought to a proper degree of fermentation, they will more or less in the same way
become useful. That oats will, I am satisfied from what I have been told by one of the intelligent
friends of Captain Cook. This gentleman being on a cruize in a large ship*, in the beginning of the
late war, and the scurvy breaking out among his crew, he bethought him self of a kind of food he had
seen used in some parts of the country, as the most proper on the occasion. Some oatmeal is put into
a wooden vessel, hot water is poured upon it, and the infusion continues until the liquor begins to
taste sourish, that is, till a fermentation comes on, which in a place moderately warm, may be in
the space of two days. The water is then poured off from the grounds, and boiled down to the
consistence of a jelly**. This he ordered to be made and dealt out in messes, being first sweetened
with sugar, and seasoned with some prize French wine, which though turned sour, yet improved the
taste, and made this aliment not less palatable than medicinal.</p><p>He assured me, that upon this diet chiefly, and by abstaining from salted meats, his scorbutic
sick had quite recovered on board; and not in that voyage only, bur, by the same means, in his
subsequent cruizes during the war, without his being obliged to send one of them on shore because
they could not get well at sea. Yet oat-meal unfermented, like barley unmalted, hath no sensible
effect in curing the scurvy: as if the fixed air, which is incorporated with these grains, could mix
with the chyle which they produce, enter the lacteals, and make part of the nourishment of the body,
without manifesting any elastic or antiseptic quality, when not loosened by a previous
fermentation.</p><p>[* The Essex, a seventy-gun ship.]</p><p>[** This rural food, in the North, is called Sooins.]</p><p>Before the power of the <emph>fixed air</emph> in subduing putrefaction was known, the efficacy
of fruits, greens, and fermented liquors, was commonly ascribed to the acid in their composition and
we have still reason to believe that the acid concurs in operating that effect. If it be alleged
that mineral acids, which contain little or no <emph>fixed air</emph>, have been tried in the scurvy
with little success, I would answer, that I doubt that in those trials they have never been
sufficiently diluted; for it is easy to conceive, that in the small quantity of water the elixir of
vitriol, for instance, is commonly given, that austere acid can scarce get beyond the first
passages; considering the delicate sensibility of the mouths of the lacteals, which must force them
to shut and exclude so pungent a liquor. It were therefore a proper experiment to be made, in a
deficiency of malt, or when that grain shall happen to be spoilt by keeping*, to use water
acidulated with the spirit of sea-salt, in the proportion of only ten drops to a quart; or with the
weak spirit of vitriol, thirteen drops to the same measure**; and to give to those that are
threatened with the disease three quarts of this liquor daily, to be consumed as they shall think
proper.</p><p>[* Captain Cook told me, that the malt held out sufficiently good for the two first years; but
that in the third, having lost much of its taste, he doubted whether it retained any of its virtues.
Mr. Patten however observed, that though the malt at that time was sensibly decayed, yet
nevertheless he had still found it useful when he employed a large proportion of it to make the
infusion.]</p><p>[** In these proportions I found the water taste just acidulous and pleasant.]</p><p>But if the <emph>fixed air</emph> and acids are such preservatives against the scurvy, why should
Captain Cook make so little account of the <emph>rob</emph> of lemons and of oranges (for so they
have called the extracts or inspissated juices of those fruits) in treating that distemper? This I
found was the reason. These preparations being only sent out upon trial, the surgeon of the ship was
told, at a conjecture, how much he might give for a dose, but without strictly limiting it. The
experiment was made with the quantity specified, but with so little advantage, that judging it not
adviseable to lose more time, he set about the cure with the wort only, whereof the efficacy he was
certain; whilst he reserved these robs for other purposes; more particularly for colds, when, to a
large draught of warm water, with some spirits and sugar, he added a spoonful of one of them, and
with this composition made a grateful sudorific that answered the intention. No wonder then if
Captain Cook, not knowing the proper dose of these concentrated juices for the scurvy, but feeing
them fail as they were given in the trial, should entertain no great opinion of their antiscorbutic
virtue. It may be also proper to take notice, that as they had been reduced to a small proportion of
their bulk by evaporation upon fire, it is probable, they were much weakened by that process, and
that with their aqueous parts they had lost not a little of their aerial, on which so much of their
antiseptic power depended. If, therefore, a further trial of these excellent fruits were to be made,
it would seem more adviseable to send to sea the purified juices entire in casks; agreeably to a
proposal I find hath been made to the Admiralty some years ago by an ingenious and experienced
surgeon of the navy. For in truth, the testimonies in favour of the salutary qualities of these
acids are so numerous and so strong, that I should look upon some failures, even in cases where
their want of success cannot so well be accounted for, as in this voyage, not a sufficient reason
for striking them out of the list of the most powerful preservatives against this consuming malady
of sailors.</p><p>It may be observed, that Captain Cook says not more in praise of vinegar than of the
<emph>robs</emph>; yet I would not thence infer that he made no account of that acid, but only that
as he happened in this voyage to be sparingly provided with it and yet did well, he could not
consider a large store of vinegar to be so material an article of provision as was commonly
imagined. And though he supplied its place in the messes of the men with the acid of the sour-crout,
and trusted chiefly to fire for purifying his decks, yet it is to be hoped that future navigators
will not therefore omit it. Vinegar will serve at least for a wholesome variety in the seasoning of
salted meats, and may be sometimes successfully used as a medicine, especially in the aspersions of
the berths of the sick. It is observable, that though the smell be little grateful to a person in
health, yet it is commonly agreeable to those who are sick, at least to such as are confined to a
foul and crowded ward. There the physician himself will smell to vinegar, as much for pleasure as
for guarding against infection.</p><p>Now the wort and the acid juices were only dispensed as medicines, but the next article was of
more extensive use. This was the Sour-Crout (sour cabbage), a food of universal request in Germany.
The acidity is acquired by its spontaneous fermentation, and it was the sour taste which made it the
more acceptable to all who ate it. To its further commendation we may add, that it held out good to
the 1ast of the voyage.</p><p>It may seem strange, that though this herb hath had so high encomiums bestowed upon it by the
ancients (witness what Cato the elder and Pliny the Naturalist say on the subject), and hath had the
sanction of the experience of nations for ages, it should yet be disapproved of by some of the most
distinguished medical writers of our times. One finds it yield a rank smell in decoction, which he
confounds with that of putrefaction. Another analyzes it, and discovers so much gross air in the
composition as to render it indigestible; yet this flatulence, so much decryed, must now be
acknowledged to be the <emph>fixed air</emph>, which makes the cabbage so wholesome when fermented.
Nay it hath been traduced by one of the most celebrated physicians of our age, as partaking of a
poisonous nature: nor much better founded was that notion of the same illustrious professor, that
cabbage being an alcalescent plant, and therefore disposing to putrefaction, could never be used in
the scurvy, except when the disease proceeded from an acid. But the experiments which I formerly
laid before the Society evinced this vegetable, with the rest of the supposed alcalescents, to be
really acescent; and proved that the scurvy is never owing to acidity, but, much otherwise, to a
species of putrefaction; that very cause, of which the ill-grounded class of alcalescents was
supposed to be a promoter*.</p><p>[* See this remark more at large, in my Observations on the Diseases of the Army, App. Pap.
7.]</p><p>Among other of the late improvements of the naval stores we have heard much of the Portable-Soup,
and accordingly we find that Captain Cook hath not a little availed himself of it in his voyage.
This concentrated broth being freed from all fat, and having by long boiling evaporated the most
putrescent parts of the meat, is reduced to the consistence of a glue, which in effect it is, and
will, like other glues, in a dry place, keep sound for years together. It hath been said, that
broths turn sour on keeping, though made without any vegetable*. Now, whether any real acid can be
thus formed or not, I incline at least to believe that the gelatinous parts of animal substances,
such as compose these cakes, are not of a nature much disposed to putrefy. But however that may be,
since Captain Cook observes, that this soup was the means of making his people eat a greater
quantity of greens than they would have done otherwise, in so far we must allow it to have been
virtually antiseptic.</p><p>[* La feule matiere qui s'aigriffe dans le sang est la matiere gelatincuse, etc. Senac, Structure
du Coeur, 1. iii. ch. 4. para. 5.]</p><p>So much for those articles that have of late been supplied to all the king's ships on long
voyages, and in which therefore our worthy brother claims no other merit than the prudent
dispensation of them; but what follows being regulations either wholly new, or improven hints from
some of his experienced friends, we may justly appropriate them to himself.</p><p>First then, he put his people at three watches, instead of two, which last is the general
practice at sea; that is, he divided the whole crew into three companies, and by putting each
company upon the watch by turns, four hours at a time, every man had eight hours free, for four of
duty: whereas at watch and watch, the half of the men being on duty at once, with returns of it
every four hours, they can have but broken sleep, and when exposed to wet, they have not time to get
dry before they lie down. When the service requires it, such hardships must be endured; but when
there is no pressing call, ought not a mariner to be refreshed with as much uninterrupted rest as a
common day-labourer?</p><p>I am well informed, that an officer distinguishes himself in nothing more than in preserving his
men from wet and the other injuries of the weather. These were most essential points with this
humane commander. In the torrid zone he shaded his people from the scorching sun by an awning over
his deck, and in his course under the antarctic circle he had a coat provided for each man, of a
substantial woollen stuff, with the addition of a hood for covering their heads. This garb (which
the sailors called their Magellan jacket) they occasionally wore, and found it more comfortable for
working in rain and snow, and among the broken ice in the high latitudes of the South.</p><p>Let us proceed to another article, one of the most material, the care to guard against
putrefaction, by keeping clean the persons, the cloaths, bedding, and berths of the sailors. The
Captain acquainted me, that regularly, one morning in the week, he passed his ship's company in
review, and saw that every man had changed his linen, and was in other points as clean and neat as
circumstances would permit. It is well known how much cleanliness is conducive to health, but it is
not so obvious how much it also tends to good order and other virtues. That diligent officer was
persuaded (nor was perhaps the observation new) that such men as he could induce to be more cleanly
than they were disposed to be of themselves, became at the same time more sober, more orderly, and
more attentive to their duty. It must be acknowledged that a seaman has but indifferent means to
keep himself clean, had he the greatest inclination to do it; for I have not heard that commanders
of ships have yet availed themselves of the <emph>still</emph> for providing fresh water for
washing; and it is well known that sea-water doth not mix with soap, and that linen wet with brine
never thoroughly dries. But for Captain Cook, the frequent opportunities he had of taking in water
among the islands of the South-Sea, enabled him in that tract to dispense to his ship's company some
fresh water for every use; and when he navigated in the high latitudes of the Southern Oceans, he
still more abundantly provided them with it, as you will find by the sequel of this discourse.</p><p>Of the hammocks and bedding I need say little, as all officers are now sensible, how much it
concerns the health of their people to have this part of a ship's furniture kept dry and well-aired;
since by the perspiration of so many men, every thing below, even in the space of twenty-four hours,
is apt to contract an offensive moisture. But Captain Cook was not satisfied with ordering upon deck
the hammocks and bedding every day that was fair (the common method) but took care that every bundle
should be unlashed, and so spread out, that every part of it might be exposed to the air.</p><p>His next concern was to see to the purity of the ship itself, without which attention all the
rest would have profited little. I shall not however detain you with the orders about washing and
scraping the decks, as I do not understand that in this kind of cleansing he excelled others; but
since our author has laid so great a stress upon <emph>Fire</emph>, as a purifier, I shall endeavour
to explain the way of using it, more fully than he has done in his Paper. Some wood, and that not
sparingly, being put into a proper stove or grate, is lighted, and carried successively to every
part below deck. Wherever fire is, the air nearest to it being heated becomes specifically lighter,
and by being lighter rises, and passes through the hatchways into the atmosphere. The vacant space
is filled with the cold air around, and that being heated in its turn, in like manner ascends, and
is replaced by other air as before. Thus, by continuing the fire for some time, in any of the lower
apartments, the foul air is in a good measure driven out, and the fresh admitted. This is not all: I
apprehend that the acid steams of the wood, in burning, act here as an antiseptic and correct the
corrupted air that remains.</p><p>An officer of distinguished rank, another of Captain Cook's experienced friends, mentioned to me
a common and just observation in the fleet, which was, that all the old twenty-gun ships were
remarkably less sickly than those of the same size of a modern construction. This, he said, was a
circumstance he could not otherwise account for, than, by the former having their
<emph>galley</emph>* in the fore-part of the <emph>orlop</emph>**, the chimney vented so ill, that
it was sure to fill every part with smoke whenever the wind was a-stern. This was a nuisance for the
time, but, as he thought, abundantly compensated by the extraordinary good health of the several
crews. Possibly those fire-places were also beneficial, by drying and ventilating the lower decks,
more when they were below, than they can do now that they are placed under the fore-castle upon the
upper deck.</p><p>[* Their fire-place or kitchen.]</p><p>[** The deck immediately above the hold.]</p><p>But the most obvious use of the portable fires was their drying up the moisture, and especially
in those places where there was the least circulation of air. This humidity, composed of the
perspirable matter of a multitude of men, and often of animals (kept for a live-flock) and of the
steams of the bilge water from the well, where the corruption is the greatest; this putrid moisture,
I say, being one of the main sources of the scurvy, was therefore more particularly attended to, in
order to its removal. The fires were the powerful instrument for that purpose, and whilst they
burned, some men were employed in rubbing hard, with canvass or oakum, every part of the inside of
the ship that was damp and accessible. But the advantage of fire appears no where so manifest as in
cleansing the well; for this being in the lowest part of the hold, the whole leakage runs into it,
whether of the ship itself, or of the casks of spoilt meats or corrupted water. The mephitic
vapours, from this sink alone, have often been the cause of instantaneous death to those who have
unwarily approached to clean it; and not to one only, but to several successively, when they have
gone down to succour their unfortunate companions: yet this very place has not only been rendered
safe but sweet, by means of an iron pot filled with fire and let down to burn in it.</p><p>When, from the circumstances of the weather, this salutary operation could not take place, the
ship was fumigated with gun-powder, as described in the Paper; though that smoke could have no
effect in drying, but only in remedying the corruption of the air, by means of the acid spirits from
the sulphur and nitre, aided perhaps by some species of an aerial fluid, then disengaged from the
fuel, to counteract putrefaction. But as these purifications by gun-powder, as well as by burning
tar and other resinous substances, are sufficiently known, I shall not insist longer on them
here.</p><p>Among the several means of sweetening or renewing the air, we should expect to hear of Dr.
Hales's <emph>Ventilator</emph>. I must confess it was my expectation, and therefore, persuaded as I
was of the excellence of the invention, it was not without much regret that I saw so good an
opportunity lost, of giving the same favourable impression of it to the Public. If a degree of
success, exceeding our most sanguine hopes, is not sufficient for justifying the omission of a
measure, deemed one of the most essential for attaining an end, I would plead in favour of our
worthy brother, that by a humiliating fatality, so often accompanying the most useful discoveries,
the credit of this ventilator is yet far from being firmly established in the navy. What wonder
then, if Captain Cook being so much otherwise taken up, should not have had time to examine it, and
therefore avoided the encumbering his ship with an apparatus, he had possibly never seen used, and
of which he had at best received but a doubtful character? Nor was he altogether unprovided with a
machine for ventilation. He had the <emph>Wind-Sails</emph>, though he hath not mentioned them in
his Paper, and he told me that he had found them at times very serviceable, and particularly between
the Tropics. They have the merit of taking up little room, they require no labour in working, and
the contrivance is so simple that they can sail in no hands. But their powers are small in
comparison with those of the ventilator; they cannot be put up in hard gales of wind, and they are
of no efficacy in dead calms, when a refreshment of the air is most wanted. Should there be any
objection to the employing both?</p><p>Such were the measures taken by our sagacious Navigator for procuring a purity of air. It remains
only to see in what manner he supplied pure water; another article of so great moment, that the
thirsty voyager, upon his salt and putrid diet, with a short allowance of this element, and that in
a corrupted Rate, must account a plentiful provision of fresh water to be indeed the <emph>best of
things</emph>.</p><p>Captain Cook was not without an apparatus for distilling sea-water, and though he could not
obtain nearly so much as was expected from the invention, yet he sometimes availed himself of it;
but for the most of his voyage he was otherwise provided. Within the Southern Tropic, in the Pacific
Ocean, he found so many islands, and those so well stored with springs, that, as I have hinted
before, he seldom was without a sufficiency of fresh water for every useful purpose. But not
satisfied with plenty, he would have the purest; and therefore whenever an opportunity offered, he
emptied what he had taken in but a few days before, and filled his casks anew. But was he not above
four months in his passage from the Cape of Good Hope to New Zeeland, in the frozen zone of the
South, without once seeing land? and did he not actually complete his circumnavigation, in that high
latitude, without the benefit of a single fountain? Here was indeed a <emph>wonder of the
Deep</emph>! I may call it the <emph>Romance of his Voyage</emph>! Those very shoals, fields, and
floating mountains of ice, among which he steered his perilous course, and which presented such
terrifying prospects of destruction; those, I say, were the very means of his support, by supplying
him abundantly with what he most wanted. It had been said that those stupendous masses of ice,
called <emph>islands</emph> or <emph>mountains</emph>, melted into fresh water, though Crantz, the
relator of that paradox, did not imagine they originated from the sea, but that they were first
formed in the great rivers of the North, and being carried down into the ocean, were afterwards
increased to that amazing height by the snow that fell upon them*. But that all frozen sea-water
would thaw into fresh, had either never been asserted, or had met with little credit. This is
certain that Captain Cook expected no such transmutation, and therefore was agreeably surprised to
find he had one difficulty less to encounter, that of preserving the health of his men so long on
salt-provisions, with a scanty allowance of corrupted water, or what he could procure by
distillation The melted ice of the sea was not only fresh but soft, and so wholesome, as to show the
fallacy of human reason unsupported by experiments. An ancient of great authority had assigned, from
theory, bad qualities to melted snow; and from that period to the present times, this prejudice
extended to ice had not been quite removed.</p><p>[* Hist. of Greenland, b. I. ch, ii. para 11, 12.]</p><p>In this circumnavigation, amidst sleets and falls of snow, fogs, and much moist weather, the
<emph>Resolution</emph> enjoyed nearly the same good state of health she had done in the temperate
and torrid zones. It appears only from the journal of the Surgeon, that towards the end of the first
course* some of the crew began to complain of the scurvy; but the disease made little progress,
except in one who had become early an invalid from another cause. The other disorders were likewise
inconsiderable, such as common colds, slight diarrhoeas, and intermittents that readily yielded to
the Bark: there were also some fevers of a continued form, but which by timely care never rose to an
alarming height. Much commendation is therefore due to the attention and abilities of Mr. PATTEN,
the Surgeon of the <emph>Resolution</emph>, for having so well seconded his Captain in the discharge
of his duty. For it must be allowed, that in despite of the best regulations and the best
provisions, there will always be among a numerous crew, during a long voyage, some casualties more
or less productive of sickness; and that unless there be an intelligent medical assistant on board,
many under the wisest Commander will perish, that otherwise might have been saved.</p><p>[* Viz. The voyage between the Cape of Good Hope and New Zealand.]</p><p>These, Gentlemen, are the reflections I had to lay before you on this interesting subject; and if
I have encroached on your time, you will recollect that much of my discourse hath been employed in
explaining some things but just mentioned by Captain Cook, and in adding other materials, which I
had procured partly from himself, and partly, after his departure, from those intelligent friends he
alludes to in his Paper. This was my plan; which, as I have now executed, you will please to return
your thanks to those gentlemen, who, on your account, so cheerfully communicated to me their
observations.</p><p>As to your acknowledgments to Captain Cook, and your high opinion of his deserts, you will best
testify them by the honourable distinction suggested by your Council, in presenting him with this
medal: for I need not gather your suffrages, since the attention with which you have favoured me
hath abundantly expressed your approbation. My satisfaction therefore had been complete, had he
himself been present to receive the honours you now confer upon him. But you are apprized that our
brave and indefatigable Brother is at this instant far removed from us, anticipating, I may say,
your wonted request on these occasions, by continuing his labours for the advancement of Natural
Knowledge, and for the honour of this Society: as you may be assured, that the object of his new
enterprize is not less great, perhaps still greater than either of the former.</p><p>Allow me then, GENTLEMEN, to deliver this medal, with his unperishing name engraven upon it, into
the hands of one who will be happy to receive that trust, and to know that this respectable Body
never more cordially nor more meritoriously bestowed that faithful symbol of their esteem and
affection. For if Rome decreed the <emph>Civic Crown</emph> to him who saved the life of a single
citizen, what wreaths are due to that Man, who, having himself saved many, perpetuates in your
Transactions the means by which Britain may now, on the most distant voyages, preserve numbers of
her intrepid sons, her Mariners; who, braving every danger, have so liberally contributed to the
fame, to the opulence, and to the maritime empire, of their Country*.</p><p>[* Here followed Captain Cook's Paper, which was presented to the Society, and is inserted in
part 2. vol. 1xvi. of the Philosophical Transactions; but as the Substance of that Publication is
now contained in the last pages of Captain Cook's Voyage, it was judged unnecessary to repeat it
here. The only material circumstance of Captain Cook's communication to the Society, omitted in his

embarkation, dated <emph>Plymouth Sound</emph>, <date>July 7, 1776</date>; and is as follows:</p><p>"I entirely agree with you, that the dearness of the Rob of lemons, and of oranges, will hinder
them from being furnished in large quantities; but I do not think this so necessary, for though they
may assist other things, I have no great opinion of them alone. Nor have I a higher opinion of
vinegar: my people had it very sparingly during the late voyage; and towards the latter part, none
at all; and yet we experienced no ill effects from the want of it. The custom of washing the inside
of the ship with vinegar I seldom observed, thinking that fire and smoke answered the purpose much
better."]</p><p>END OF VOLUME II.</p></div></div></div></body></text></TEI>
