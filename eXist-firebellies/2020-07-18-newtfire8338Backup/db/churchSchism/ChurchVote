The <schism>vote</schism> was taken today at <sec><parish>St. Martin's Episcopal Church</parish> in <location>Monroeville</location>.</sec> The results were greeted with silence.

<quote ref="Lewis">"This is a very sad day. There are no winners here,"</quote> he said. 

The clergy <stat>voted 121 </stat>in favor of the <schism>split</schism>, <stat>33 against</stat>, <stat>three abstentions</stat> and <stat>two invalid ballots.</stat> 

Among the laiety, <stat>119 voted in favor</stat>, <stat>69 were opposed</stat> and there were <stat>three abstentions</stat>. 

Those who supported the <schism/>split say it has been decades in coming. They point to <sect type="Episcopal">Episcopalians</sect> who doubt the divinity of Jesus, blessing dogs as part of the liturgy, allowing marriage of same sex couples and the ordination of openly gay teaching. A majority of the <sec><stat>80 million-member</stat><sect type="Anglican">Anglican</sect> Communion,</sec> a worldwide coalition of churches that align with the<sec> Church of<location> England</location></sec>, say Scripture condemns homosexuality.
