    <des><pref>Rock Tunnel</pref> is the only alternative route to <pref>Lavender Town</pref>, as the two other routes have
        been rendered inaccessible by a slumbering <pokemon dexNum="143">Snorlax</pokemon> and the
            <pers>Saffron City gatekeepers</pers>. The cave has two separate floors, both of which
        are roughly the same size. There are many Trainers within the cave, there for the fun of
        exploring, training, or are simply lost in the darkness.</des>
