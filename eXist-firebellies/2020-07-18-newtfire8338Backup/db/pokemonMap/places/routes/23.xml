    <des>Route 23 heads northeast, passing through the first of many archways on the route as well
        as the second checkpoint. Northwest of this point is the second archway and the third
        checkpoint. The main path of the road then heads north, taking a slight northeast alignment
        as it approaches the third archway and the fourth checkpoint on the bank of a waterway that
        effectively separates the route into two halves. </des>
