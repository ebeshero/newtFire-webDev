    <des>Heading north from <pref>Pallet Town</pref>, Trainers must make their way around a large but very
        primitive route, that will become their very first route they will explore on their journey.
        The route is riddled with large patches of tall grass, and ledges that contour from far east
        to all to the far west, blocking off most of the route making it hard to travel north, only
        to have small gaps by which the road has been broken into it. The <pref>Pok√© Mart</pref> assistant giving
