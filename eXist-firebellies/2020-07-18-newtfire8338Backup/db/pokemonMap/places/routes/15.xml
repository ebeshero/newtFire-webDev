    <des>The route is separated into two halves by a long ledge, placing the northern half on a
        hill. The northern half can be accessed by using <item>Cut</item> to remove a tree at its
        eastern entrance on <pref>Route 14</pref>. Trainers can travel from the northern half to the
        southern half at any time by hopping the ledge; however, the reverse is not possible.</des>
