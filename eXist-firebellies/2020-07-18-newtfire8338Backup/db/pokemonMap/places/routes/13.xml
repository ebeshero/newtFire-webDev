    <des>The eastern terminus of <pref>Route 13</pref> is actually located on part of the
            <pref>Silence Bridge</pref>. The structure heads south, then west along a treeline
        before reaching solid ground near the southeast corner of a large maze of fences that
        occupies the entire length of the route. From this point westward, Trainers can no longer
        access the large water body that runs along the southern edge of the route due to a series
        of shrubs and fences that line the route.</des>
