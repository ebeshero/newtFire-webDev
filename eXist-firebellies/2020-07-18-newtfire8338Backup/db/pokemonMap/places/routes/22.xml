    <des>After departing <pref>Viridian City</pref>, <pref>Route 22</pref> turns south at a line of
        trees before circling around the bottom of the treeline and passing north through a grassy
        patch of wild Pok√©mon. North of the patch, the route turns west, passing over a small hill
        as well as a small pond. <pref>Route 22</pref> then turns south, hopping over a ledge into
        another patch of grass. Six paces to the south, <pref>Route 22</pref> returns west, then
        north, passing through a hole in the fence outside the checkpoint building. To the
        northeast, the road goes through a break in a ledge before entering the building, emerging
        as <pref>Route 23</pref> on the north side.</des>
