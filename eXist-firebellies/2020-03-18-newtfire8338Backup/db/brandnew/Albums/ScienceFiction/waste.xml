    <lyrics>
        <line n="1">Scream in there.</line>
        <line n="2">AHHHHHH!</line>
        <line n="3">You and I are stuck in our ways</line>
        <line n="4">Talking about our salad days</line>
        <line n="5">What a damn lie</line>
        <line n="6">But you and I are stuck like glue</line>
        <line n="7">And that's the God damn truth</line>
        <line n="8">Baby, bye-bye</line>
        <line n="9">Well, you could turn to water and we'd all float on</line>
        <line n="10">Give up trying to be someone</line>
        <line n="11">Take your head apart</line>
        <line n="12">Free your own heart</line>
        <line n="13">You and I are stuck out of phase</line>
        <line n="14">Always begging for some grace when there's no time</line>
        <line n="15">We get no reply</line>
        <line n="16">Every night you were tripping out</line>
        <line n="17">In the morning you were coming down</line>
        <line n="18">If it's breaking your heart, if nothing is fun</line>
        <line n="19">Don't lose hope, my son</line>
        <line n="20">This is the last one</line>
        <line n="21">You and I repent of our sins</line>
        <line n="22">Yeah, we feel so American laying in the road</line>
        <line n="23">Was a shoe-in for the crash of the day</line>
        <line n="24">And we're never going to walk away</line>
        <line n="25">Never going home</line>
        <line n="26">I'm hoping that in time, you can lay down</line>
        <line n="27">All this weight you've been carrying around and maybe one day</line>
        <line n="28">You'll find your way</line>
        <line n="29">To climb on up out of your grave</line>
        <line n="30">With the bits of you you managed to save</line>
        <line n="31">And for the last time</line>
        <line n="32">Yeah, you say good-bye</line>
        <line n="33">Every night you were tripping out</line>
        <line n="34">In the morning you were coming down</line>
        <line n="35">If it's breaking your heart, if nothing is fun</line>
        <line n="36">Don't lose hope, my son</line>
        <line n="37">This is the last one</line>
        <line n="38">'Cause every night had you laid low</line>
        <line n="39">It's going to feel so good to let it go</line>
        <line n="40">It's all in your head, your race is run</line>
        <line n="41">Don't give up, my son, this is the last one</line>
        <line n="42">This is the last one</line>
        <line n="43">You are not alone, you are not alone</line>
        <line n="44">You are not alone, you get to reset</line>
        <line n="45">You are not alone, you are not alone</line>
        <line n="46">You are not alone, you get to reset</line>
        <line n="47">Every night you were tripping out</line>
        <line n="48">In the morning you were coming down</line>
        <line n="49">If it's breaking your heart, if nothing is fun</line>
        <line n="50">Don't lose hope, my son</line>
        <line n="51">This is the last one</line>
        <line n="52">Every night had you laid low</line>
        <line n="53">It's going to feel so good to let it go</line>
        <line n="54">It's all in your head, your race is run</line>
        <line n="55">Don't give up, my son, this is the last one</line>
        <line n="56">This is the last one</line>
