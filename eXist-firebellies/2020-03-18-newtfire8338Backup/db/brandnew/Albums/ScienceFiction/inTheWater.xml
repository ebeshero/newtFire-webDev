    <lyrics>
        <line n="1">In the <refer img="water">water</refer>, they sort it out</line>
        <line n="2">They were waist to neck in <refer img="time">December</refer> somehow</line>
        <line n="3">In the <refer img="water">water</refer>, they twist and shout</line>
        <line n="4">They were born again, so they can start living now</line>
        <line n="5">In the <refer img="water">water</refer>, they saw the face</line>
        <line n="6">Of the man who once owned it, ashamed and disgraced</line>
        <line n="7">In the <refer img="water">water</refer>, they asked them both</line>
        <line n="8">"How did you get the gold without digging any holes?"</line>
        <line n="9">Never had it any other way</line>
        <line n="10">Drowning in the praise</line>
        <line n="11">Never had a chance to break apart</line>
        <line n="12">Hard for them to see</line>
        <line n="13">What's really in this place, now</line>
        <line n="14">"Hide your daughters", the old men say</line>
        <line n="15">You were young once before, you know how we get our way</line>
        <line n="16">Feel the horror with no delay</line>
        <line n="17">We all see what once was beautiful has turned and old and grey</line>
        <line n="18">Never had it any other way</line>
        <line n="19">Drowning in the praise</line>
        <line n="20">Never had a chance to break apart</line>
        <line n="21">Hard for them to see</line>
        <line n="22">It's really a disgrace</line>
        <line n="23">I can't think it enough</line>
        <line n="24">Can't say it enough</line>
        <line n="25">Can't do it enough</line>
        <line n="26">I can't make it enough</line>
        <line n="27">Can't fake it enough</line>
        <line n="28">I don't want it enough</line>
        <line n="29">So everyone'll wait</line>
        <line n="30">Never had it any other way</line>
        <line n="31">Drowning in the grace</line>
        <line n="32">Never had a chance to break apart</line>
        <line n="33">Hard for them to see</line>
        <line n="34">It's really in its place</line>
        <line n="35">I can't say it enough</line>
        <line n="36">Can't sing it enough</line>
        <line n="37">So I'll find another way</line>
        <line n="38">And we sing this morning that wonderful and grand ol' message</line>
        <line n="39">And I don't know about you, I never get tired of it</line>
        <line n="40">Numbe-</line>
        <line n="41">The seven years</line>
        <line n="42">The seven years</line>
        <line n="43">The seven years</line>
        <line n="44">The seven years</line>
        <line n="45">The seven years</line>
        <line n="46">The seven years</line>
        <line n="47">The seven years</line>
