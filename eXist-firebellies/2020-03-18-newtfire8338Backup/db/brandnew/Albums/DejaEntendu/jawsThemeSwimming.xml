    <lyrics>
        <verse n="1">
            <line n="1">In a <refer img="car">car</refer> outside, we stalk the idle kind</line>
            <line n="2">If you're leaving, just let me know</line>
            <line n="3"><refer img="drugs">Tobacco</refer> and peppermint, dusting for fingerprints</line>
            <line n="4">A film in her eyes from the glow</line>

            <line n="5">Some rules are made with all intentions to break</line>
            <line n="6">And she defends it with a warped rationale</line>
            <line n="7">And I've seen what happens to the wicked and proud</line>
            <line n="8">When they decide to try to take on the throne for the crown</line>
        </verse>

        <chorus n="1">
            <line n="9">And we learn as we age</line>
            <line n="10">We've learned nothing and my body still aches</line>
            <line n="11">And you take cause they give</line>
            <line n="12">Though I love you and my body it leaks like a sieve</line>
        </chorus>

        <verse n="2">
            <line n="13">When it got cold outside, smoke beneath the playground lights</line>
            <line n="14">If you're coming home, just let me know</line>
            <line n="15">Sucking on your breath mint, dissected and stuck with pins</line>
            <line n="16">A film in her eyes from the glow</line>

            <line n="17">Concrete and <refer img="water">water</refer>, she's looking for her daughter</line>
            <line n="18">At <refer img="time">midnight </refer>in <refer img="water">torrential downpour</refer></line>
            <line n="19">And everything I said about how messed your head is</line>
            <line n="20">Was cut up and left in bits and pieces on the cutting room floor</line>
        </verse>

        <chorus n="2">
            <line n="21">And we learn as we age</line>
            <line n="22">We've learned nothing and my body still aches</line>
            <line n="23">And you take cause they give</line>
            <line n="24">Though I love you and my body it leaks like a sieve</line>
        </chorus>

        <chorus n="3">
            <line n="25">And we learn as we age</line>
            <line n="26">We've learned nothing and my body still aches</line>
            <line n="27">And you take cause they give</line>
            <line n="28">Though I love you and my body it leaks like a sieve</line>
        </chorus>


        <bridge n="1">
            <line n="29">Take the picture from the wall when you think that nothing matters</line>
            <line n="30">Take the picture from the plane and it's a long ways to the floor</line>
            <line n="31">Cut your finger on the edge cause it's sharper than they told you</line>
            <line n="32">Take a leap from out the window cause it's way too far to go through the
                door</line>
        </bridge>

        <chorus n="4">
            <line n="33">And we learn as we age</line>
            <line n="34">We've learned nothing and my body still aches</line>
            <line n="35">And you take cause they give</line>
            <line n="36">Though I love you and my body it leaks like a sieve</line>
        </chorus>
