            <line n="1">Am I correct to defend the fist that holds this pen?</line>
            <line n="2">It's ink that lies,</line>
            <line n="3">the pen, the page, the paper.</line>
            <line n="4">I live, I learn.</line>
            <line n="5">You will always take what I have earned.</line>
            <line n="6">And so aid my end while I believe I'm winning.</line>

            <line n="7">Our friends <refer type="idiom">speak out</refer> in our defense.</line>
            <line n="8">Pay ten deaf ears for two months rent.</line>

            <line n="15">Only common conversation,</line>
            <line n="16">it took everything I got.</line>

        <verse n="2">
            <line n="18">Once said, always said.</line>
            <line n="19">I will hold the past over your head.</line>
            <line n="20">I'll <refer type="idiom">speak my mind</refer> whenever I feel slighted.</line>
            <line n="21">I am hellbent on extracting all of my revenge.</line>
            <line n="22">Take heart, sweetheart, or I will take it from you.</line>


            <line n="23">We slip concealed back to the keep.</line>
            <line n="24">Concede to do the work for free.</line>
            <line n="25">We prey as <refer img="animal">wolves</refer> among the <refer img="animal">sheep</refer> and slit the necks of soldiers while they
                sleep.</line>
