            <line n="2">Don't you dare forget.</line>
            <line n="3">I am all you've ever wanted,</line>
            <line n="4">What all the other boys all promised.</line>
            <line n="5">Sorry I told. I just needed you to know.</line>
            <line n="6">I think in decimals and dollars.</line>
            <line n="7">I am the cause to all your problems,</line>
            <line n="8">Shelter from cold. we are never alone.</line>
            <line n="9">Coordinate brain and mouth.</line>
            <line n="10">Then ask me whats it like to have</line>
            <line n="11">Myself so figured out.</line>
            <line n="12">I wish I knew..</line>
        </verse>

        <verse n="2">
            <line n="13">I hope this song starts a craze.</line>
            <line n="14">The kind of song that ignites the airwaves.</line>
            <line n="15">The kind of song that makes people glad</line>
            <line n="16">To be where they are,</line>
            <line n="17">With whomever they're there with.</line>
            <line n="18">This is war.</line>
            <line n="19">Every line is about,</line>
            <line n="20">Who I don't wanna write about anymore.</line>
            <line n="21">Hope you come down with something</line>
            <line n="22">They can't diagnose, don't have the cure for.</line>
            <line n="23">Holding on to your grudge.</line>
            <line n="24">Oh its so hard to have someone to love.</line>
            <line n="25">And keeping quiet is hard.</line>
            <line n="26">Cause you cant keep a secret</line>
            <line n="27">If it never was a secret to start.</line>
            <line n="28">At least pretend you didn't wanna get caught..</line>
        </verse>

        <chorus n="1">
            <line n="29">We're concentrating on falling apart.</line>
            <line n="30">We were contenders, we're throwing the fight</line>
            <line n="31">But I just wanna believe, I just wanna believe,</line>
            <line n="32">I just wanna believe, in us.</line>
        </chorus>

        <verse n="3">
            <line n="33">Oh, we're so c-c-c-c-c-controversial.</line>
            <line n="34">We are entirely smooth.</line>
            <line n="35">We admit to the truth,</line>
            <line n="36">We are the best at what we do.</line>
            <line n="37">And these are the words you wish you wrote down.</line>
            <line n="38">This is the way you wish your voice sounds,</line>
            <line n="39">Handsome and smart.</line>
            <line n="40">Oh my tongue's the only muscle on my body</line>
            <line n="41">That works harder than my heart.</line>
            <line n="42">And its all from watching TV,</line>
            <line n="43">And from speeding up my breathing.</line>
            <line n="44">Wouldn't stop if I could.</line>
            <line n="45">Oh it hurts to be this good.</line>
            <line n="46">You're holding on to your grudge.</line>
            <line n="47">Oh it hurts to always have to be honest</line>
            <line n="48">With the one that you love.</line>
            <line n="49">Oh, so let it go..</line>

            <line n="58">This is the grace that only we can bestow.</line>
            <line n="59">This is the price you pay for loss of control.</line>
            <line n="60">This is the break in the bend,</line>
            <line n="61">This is the closest of calls.</line>
            <line n="62">This is the reason you're alone,</line>
            <line n="63">This is the rise and the fall.</line>
