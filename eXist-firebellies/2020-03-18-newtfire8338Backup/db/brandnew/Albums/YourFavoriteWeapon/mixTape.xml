        <verse n="1">
            <line n="1">I got a twenty-dollar bill that says no one's ever seen you without makeup.</line>
            <line n="2">You're always made up.</line>
            <line n="3">And I'm sick of your tattoos,</line>
            <line n="4">and the way you always criticize the <refer type="popCulture">Smiths... and Morrissey</refer>.</line>
            <line n="5">And I know that you're a sucker for anything acoustic.</line>
            <line n="6">But when I say let's <refer type="idiom">keep in touch</refer>,</line>
            <line n="7">I really mean I wish that you'd grow up.</line>
            <line n="8">This is the first song for your <refer type="songTitle">mixtape</refer>.</line>
            <line n="9">It's short just like your temper,</line>
            <line n="10">but somewhat golden like the <refer img="time">afternoons</refer> we used to spend before you got too
                cool...</line>
