    <lyrics>
        <line n="1">I <refer type="idiom">cashed in all my chips</refer>
            <refer img="time">tonight</refer> and combed my hair till it was just right.</line>
        <line n="2">Cause I've been thinking about you and me girl, and we got something going
            on.</line>
        <line n="3">You told me you can't wait to see me and then you didn't bother to even show
            up.</line>
        <line n="4">This whole situation is incredibly typical, I should have seen it all
            along.</line>
        <line n="5">It's girls like you that make my think I'm better</line>
        <line n="6">off at home on a <refer img="time">Saturday night</refer> with all my doors
            locked up tight.</line>
        <line n="7">I won't be thinking about you baby.</line>
        <line n="8">You <refer img="phone">call me on the phone,</refer> and you don't even want to talk.</line>
        <line n="9">You're staring at me from across the room then turn your back when I walk
            up.</line>
        <line n="10">We got inches away, and I never even got close.</line>
        <line n="11">So leave your lipstick at home.</line>
        <line n="12">Don't pick up the <refer img="phone">phone</refer>.</line>
        <line n="13">Don't bother to look in my direction.</line>
        <line n="14">I should have seen it <refer type="idiom">all along</refer>.</line>
        <line n="15">It's girls like you that make me</line>
        <line n="16">think I'm better off home on a <refer img="time">Saturday night</refer> with all my doors locked up
            tight.</line>
        <line n="17">I won't be thinking about you, baby.</line>
        <line n="18">Forget everything you think you know about me.</line>
        <line n="19">This isn't <refer img="school">highschool</refer></line>
        <line n="20">this isn't <refer img="school">highschool</refer></line>
        <line n="21">this isn't <refer img="school">highschool</refer></line>
        <line n="22">this isn't <refer img="school">highschool</refer></line>
