Where is Spain? where is</l><l n="11">who? The Civil War was fought to free the slaves,</l><l n="12">was it? A sudden down-draught reminds you of gravity</l><l n="13">and your position in respect to human love. But</l><l n="14">here is where the gods are, speculating, bemused.</l><l n="15">Once you are helpless, you are free, can you believe</l><l n="16">that? Never to waken to the sad struggle of a face?</l><l n="17">to travel always over some impersonal vastness,</l><l n="18">to be out of, forever, neither in nor for!</l></lg><lg n="3"><l n="19">The eyes roll asleep as if turned by the wind</l><l n="20">and the lids flutter open slightly like a wing.</l><l n="21">The world is an iceberg, so much is invisible!</l><l n="22">and was and is, and yet the form, it may be sleeping</l><l n="23">too. Those features etched in the ice of someone</l><l n="24">loved who died, you are a sculptor dreaming of space</l><l n="25">and speed, your hand alone could have done this.</l><l n="26">Curiosity, the passionate hand of desire. Dead,</l><l n="27">or sleeping? Is there speed enough? And, swooping,</l><l n="28">you relinquish all that you have made your own,</l><l n="29">the kingdom of your self sailing, for you must awake</l><l n="30">and breathe your warmth in this beloved image</l><l n="31">whether it's dead or merely disappearing,</l><l n="32">as space is disappearing and your singularity.</l></lg><date when="1957">1957</date></twinkie>
