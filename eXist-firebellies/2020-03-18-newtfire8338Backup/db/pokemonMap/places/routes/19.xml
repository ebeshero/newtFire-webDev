    <des>Heading south from <pref>Fuchsia City</pref>, <pref>Route 19</pref> becomes a dual
        carriageway, as a series of ledges and a rock wall separate the route into a southbound-only
        west half and a dual-direction east half. After three ledges, the rock wall ends and the
        route is reunited on an unnamed beach.</des>
