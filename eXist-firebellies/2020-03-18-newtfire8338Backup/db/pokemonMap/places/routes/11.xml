    <des><pref>Route 11</pref> passes over a short bridge before heading west through a clearing in the forest
        that lines the west side of <pref>Route 12</pref>. The route becomes more built-up as it approaches a
        gate, becoming fenced on each side. This station is seen by some as the eastern terminus of
        <pref>Route 11</pref>.</des>
