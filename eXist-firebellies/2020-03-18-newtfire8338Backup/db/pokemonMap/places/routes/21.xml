    <des>From <pref>Pallet</pref>, the route begins as a small channel of water. South of the town,
        an outcrop of land on the route's east side holds the only grassy area on any water route in
        Pok√©mon history. There are two small bridges containing two Trainers each spread out along
        the route. Five other Trainers are also found along the route.</des>
