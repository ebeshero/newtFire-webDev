    <des>Because of its dark and shady environment, Viridian Forest hosts a large array of different
        Bug-type Pokémon. They are not particularly powerful, but they will cause status conditions
        such as paralysis and poison. It is advised from sign posts and even from other
            <pers>Trainers</pers> that <pers>Trainers</pers> should buy status condition healing
        items such as <item>Antidote</item> and <item>Parlyz Heal</item> before entering the forest.
