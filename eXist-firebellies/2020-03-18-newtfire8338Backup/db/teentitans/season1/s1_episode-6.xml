                    along a street</directNote>, where a vehicle can be seen turned on its side in the distance.
                    A figure stands atop it, and a couple of Titans are facing off with him. In
                    close-up, they are seen as<char>Cyborg</char><char>Starfire</char> and<char>Robin</char> and the vehicle is an
                    armored car whose back doors have been broken open. Gold bullion spills out to
                    the pavement. <charDesc ref="#DoctorLight">The bearded, helmeted male figure perched on it is clad in a
                    skintight black outfit with a light bulb on the chest, and both hands glow very
                    brightly</charDesc>. This is<char>Doctor Light</char> not to be confused with the character of the
                    same name from the Mega Man game series.</sd>

               <sp><spkr ref="#DoctorLight">Doctor Light</spkr>Your pathetic skills can't outshine
                    the brilliance of<char>Doctor Light</char></sp>

               <sd>He brings his hands together; the Titans scatter as a broad beam shoots toward
                    them.<char>Robin</char>leaps high and flings a birdarang at the supervillain, who jumps
                    down to avoid both it and the thrower's lunge.</sd>

               <sp><spkr ref="#DoctorLight">Doctor Light</spkr>You're fast, but I doubt you'll enjoy
                    moving at the speed of light!</sp>

               <sd>He touches the bulb on his chest, causing it to glow and emit a wide-angle blast
                    that propels<char>Robin</char>over the roof of a nearby building.<char>Beast Boy</char>comes around a
                    corner and charges, <transform class="mammal">turning into a wolf</transform> as he runs. The robber easily ducks this
                    rush.</sd>

               <sp><spkr ref="#DoctorLight">Doctor Light</spkr>A wolf is no threat when it's blind
                    as a bat!</sp>

               <sd>He throws several glowing globes at the green lupine hero. They explode in a
                    series of brilliant flashes and leave him so dazzled that he reverts to human
                    form and claps both hands to his head woozily. The next one in is<char>Starfire</char> who
                    flies overhead and throws a barrage of starbolts;<char>Doctor Light</char>creates a radiant
                    shield around himself to block them. He drops it after she stops firing, then
                    throws a landmine-like device into the street. Its top opens to emit a wall of
                    radiation that envelops<char>Starfire</char>and blocks her in.</sd>

               <sd>Back to<char>Doctor Light</char></sd>

               <sd><directNote kind="pan">Pan to him</directNote> by the armored car. He has half of one axle in hand, tire and all, and
                    he moves in for a swing.</sd>

               <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Things are about to get heavy!</sp>

               <sd>He swings the axle down over his head, missing the enemy, but creating enough of
                    a tremor upon impact to throw him back a few feet.<char>Doctor Light</char>concentrates his
                    energy in one hand and projects an intense beam that breaks the makeshift club
                    in half. Laughing, he creates a red projectile and directs it at<char>Cyborg</char> it
                    explodes in a terrific flash and storm of dust. The view clears to show that the
                    Titan is now embedded in stone, with only his head and hands free.</sd>

               <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Uh! Hey! Let me..</sp>

               <sd>Doctor Light approaches.</sd>

               <sp><spkr ref="#DoctorLight">Doctor Light</spkr>Now if nobody minds, I'll be taking

               <sd>Before she can finish the incantation, a beam connects squarely with her and
                    sends her to the street. He walks up behind her as she starts to get up. The
                    brooch on her cloak now shows a raven's head in its gold frame, and it will
                    continue do so throughout this episode.</sd>

               <sd>She gets herself ready again; <directNote kind="pan">pan to a motorcycle</directNote> at the curb. It is levitated
                    and slung at the light-wielding enemy, who easily blows it apart. He nails her
                    with another blast and drives her down the block again. Now he takes his time
                    walking up; she has her back to him.</sd>

               <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr><sd>menacingly</sd>Don't come any closer</sp>

               <sd>He stops.</sd>

               <sd><directNote kind="cut">Cut to behind her</directNote> on the end of this line. Snarling with pure rage, she swirls to
                    her feet. Her eyes are glowing red rather than the usual white when she uses her
                    powers. <directNote kind="pull">Pull back</directNote>; she grows to an impossible height, at least three times as
                    tall as<char>Doctor Light</char> and thick black tendrils shoot toward him from under her
                    cloak. He cries out in shock.</sd>

                    you--? No, stop, you win, I surrender!</sp>

               <sd>Too late. He is dragged toward the billowing blue hem as<char>Raven</char>smiles viciously
                    down at him. When she speaks, the voice sounds as if some demonic thing is
                    saying the words along with her.</sd>

               <sp><spkr ref="#Raven">Raven</spkr>What's the matter? Afraid of the dark?</sp>

               <sp><spkr ref="#DoctorLight">Doctor Light</spkr>I surrender! NOOOOOO!</sp>

               <sd>He is pulled in;<char>Robin</char>rushes over.</sd>

               <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>RAVEN!! STOP!!</sp>

               <sd>Raven's eyes return to normal in a snap. She gasps sharply and shrinks back to
                    normal size; her cloak recedes to reveal the beaten enemy, curled up in a fetal
                    position on the pavement and shivering in wide-eyed fear.<char>Robin</char>and<char>Starfire</char>
                    out of her trap, run to comfort him.</sd>

               <sp><spkr ref="#Robin">Robin</spkr>It's okay. You're going to be all right.</sp>

               <sp><spkr ref="#DoctorLight">Doctor Light</spkr>It was...no...so dark...make it

               <sd>When she turns to face him, her eyes have again gone red and she is snarling as
                    before. He backs up behind<char>Cyborg</char>with a scream; she quickly composes herself
                    and stalks away.</sd>

               <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>What's her deal?</sp>

               <sd>Inside, he is cooking at the kitchen counter, while<char>Cyborg</char><char>Starfire</char> and Robin
                    are at the table. He has donned a chef's hat.</sd>

               <sd>Not quite ready to deal with a curveball like that so early in the day, Beast Boy
                    shouts in surprise and jumps back. He has to catch his hat in order to keep it
                    from flying across the room.<char>Cyborg</char> meanwhile, has started wolfing down a
                    plateful of food. When he finishes, he burps loudly and his expression changes
                    to resemble that of a person who has just eaten a skunk. He spits the meal out
                    disgustedly.</sd>

               <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>That's not eggs! That's that tofu stuff!</sp>

               <sd>He drains his glass to get the taste out of his mouth-but instead his whole head
                    ends up looking as if it might explode. The drink goes the way of the food.</sd>

               <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>That's not even real milk!</sp>

               <sd><char>Beast Boy</char>gives him a reproving frown as the door opens and<char>Raven</char>enters the

               <sd>She picks up the coffeepot and pours a cup.<char>Beast Boy</char>pops up behind her with a

               <sp><spkr ref="#BeastBoy">Beast Boy</spkr>It's good. Wakey-wakey, tofu eggs and

               <sd><stageDesc category="close-up">Close-up of the back of her head</stageDesc> on the end of this. She then whirls to face the

               <sd>The cook gasps in fear as she exerts her powers on the plate he holds. The eggs
                    explode like a volcano, leaving him covered with his own cuisine. He makes a

               <sd>This is Raven's room, then. The big Titan plants a hand on the little one's

                    fear comes from<char>Beast Boy</char><char>Cyborg</char>knocks, much louder than his colleague's
                    feeble attempt; on the third and final knock, snap to black. The view is

                    are about as dark as they come. Shelves filled with old books, four-eyed tragedy
                    and comedy masks on a pedestal, oddly shaped mirror on the wall, chalices and
                    braziers, ancient chests and lamps, a bed partly recessed into the far wall, a

               <sd><stageDesc category="close-up">Close-up of the mirror</stageDesc>; he pokes at a spot on his cheek. Suddenly, two pairs of

                    clear to leave him gasping in shock, and he drops the mirror and backs up with a
                    cry of fear. A red-rimmed swath of black energy shoots straight up from the
                    object, shapes itself into an arm, and grabs him. He is shaken back and forth as

               <sd><directNote kind="tilt">Tilt up to the arch</directNote> on the end of this; the birds are gone. When the camera <directNote kind="tilt">tilts
                    down again</directNote>, five of them have gathered at his feet. "Turn back" is repeated over
                    and over during a <directNote kind="pan">pan across them in <stageDesc category="close-up">close-up</stageDesc></directNote>. The beaks suddenly elongate and
                    sprout small sharp teeth, and each eye splits into two smaller ones to match the
                    raven seen earlier. Their snarls are met with a surprised cry from<char>Beast Boy</char>
                    who turns and runs smack into<char>Cyborg</char> the former tumbles o.c. while the latter
                    crashes down on the stones.</sd>

               <sd>The birds, now multiplied into a flock of ravens, fly past<char>Cyborg</char>and zero in on

                    fly low, and in response<char>Cyborg</char>growls and blasts straight down at it. Fractured
                    by the energy, the stone path starts to crumble away; the two Titans trade the
                    classic "uh-oh" look and Beast Boy's ears droop sadly just before they drop out
                    of sight. <directNote kind="cut">Cut to the broken edge</directNote> of the path, seen from below, and <directNote kind="pull">pull back</directNote>.

                    stops him cold, not so much the speaker, but the tone.</sd>

               <sd>A four-pack of eye blasts blows up the ground at Cyborg's feet and sends him

                    to continue the offensive and get backup from their partner's cannon. He bobs
                    and weaves through the barren landscape to dodge the blazing bursts and returns
                    fire as he is able. The last round gets<char>Trigon</char>good and mad; <stageDesc category="close-up">close-up of him</stageDesc> as

               <sd>The screen fills with static and then <directNote kind="cut">cuts to<char>Robin</char>on the couch</directNote>. Once again,

               <sd>She drops out of sight with a groan, and he works the remote again. More static,

                    overhead and picks him up as<char>Raven</char>passes them both. The scarlet leviathan waves

                    huddled behind a small ridge. <char>Beast Boy</char><transform class="human">is human again</transform>.</sd>

               <sd>The camera shakes as dust floats down around them.<char>Cyborg</char>peeks over the ridge
                    and sees the demonic figure nearby. A couple of eye blasts send the Titan
                    ducking back behind the rocks.</sd>

               <sp><spkr ref="#Cyborg">Cyborg</spkr>Go for it! We got your back.</sp>

               <sd><char>Beast Boy</char>gives her an encouraging nod and runs after<char>Cyborg</char>to assist in the
                    diversion. A small smile crosses her face and then disappears as she closes her
                    eyes and begins to concentrate. Her hood is down at this point, <directNote kind="dissolve">but a dissolve
                    shows her with it up</directNote>. Opening her eyes, she crosses her arms in front of herself
                    as the <directNote kind="pull">camera pulls back</directNote>; a sudden gust of wind stirs the dust at her feet, and
                    her duplicates rise from the ground. One of them is so close that her cloak
                    blacks out the screen. <directNote kind="fade">Fade in to no fewer than six Ravens</directNote> in cloaks of pink,
                    gray, green, yellow, brown, and lavender. Yellow<char>Raven</char>wears glasses, perhaps
                    representing her cerebral aspect. Well after the arrival of this group, a
                    seventh alter ego pops up, clad in an orange cloak. She digs something out of
                    her ear, opens her eyes sleepily, and burps; <char>Raven's</char> lazy side.</sd>

               <sd>They scatter; <directNote kind="cut">cut to Raven</directNote> as they form a large circle around her. All eight rise
                    into the air and hover several feet above the ground, and the seven doubles
                    start to spin about her center point, faster and faster until they are visible
                    only as colored blurs. The formation gradually turns white, sucking up a little
                    grit due to the airspeed, and the whole screen is washed out from the
                    brilliance, except for <char>Raven's</char> form, which can be seen fuzzily at the
                    center.</sd>

               <sd>A huge flash puts the camera near<char>Beast Boy</char>and<char>Cyborg</char> the latter firing his
                    cannon at will.<char>Trigon</char>counters with a storm of bird apparitions from his hand;
                    <char>Beast Boy</char><transform class="reptile">turns into a pterodactyl</transform> again and takes to the air.<char>Cyborg</char>is quickly
                    beset by the flapping things and loses control of his shots. The giant smiles
                    evilly down at him and does not notice<char>Raven</char>rising behind his own head; her
                    <charDesc ref="#WhiteRaven">tightly wrapped cloak now pure white</charDesc>. He swivels to look her full in the face,
                    and the wind blows her garment open to reveal that her outfit is also white
                    instead of black.</sd>

               <sd><char>White Raven</char>hurls a mass of black energy, which forms itself into a band that
                    encircles<char>Trigon</char>tightly from shoulders to waist. Her next words take on a very
                    deep and terrible tone.</sd>

               <sp><spkr ref="#WhiteRaven">White Raven</spkr>You are going back where you
                    belong!</sp>

               <sp><spkr ref="#Trigon">Trigon</spkr>Never!</sp>

               <sd>He breaks loose of her binding spell. She rises into the air, arms crossed in
                    front, and her eyes and mouth start to blaze with the same dark force that pours
                    from her hands. <directNote kind="cut">Cut to Trigon</directNote> and <directNote kind="pull">pull back</directNote>; he sends two huge beams from his
                    hands toward her. The two energies meet at a point between them and cancel out;
                    it becomes a tug-of-war, with the balance point shifting back and forth between
                    them. <transform class="human">Beast Boy, back in human form</transform>, and<char>Cyborg</char>have their hands full trying to
                    keep those birds from pecking them to mush, but they suddenly disappear.</sd>

               <sd>The standoff between <char>White Raven</char>and<char>Trigon</char>continues, with the former slowly
                    gaining ground. One final groaning effort sends her beam surging into his face;
                    there is an incredible flash when it hits, and the screen clears to show that he
                    has turned into another copy of her, with red eyes and a dark red cloak. <char>Red
                   Raven</char> drops to the ground in front of the white-clad real thing, revealing
                    herself to be perhaps a foot tall, and raises her head to expose two pairs of
                    those glowing eyes. Her body disintegrates into a bolt of energy that crackles
                    into <char>White Raven's</char>, throwing her into an unbearable rictus.</sd>

               <sd>One final flash leaves the screen filled with smoke, which clears to show only
                    the Titan standing on a rock-back in her normal blue cloak and bowed as if she
                    has just taken the beating of a lifetime. As she straightens up, the wind
                    reveals her black outfit beneath. A moment later, she moans weakly and collapses
                    backward only to be caught by<char>Cyborg</char>and<char>Beast Boy</char></sd>
