                            This could be a passage that relates to the chapter XIV that I am
                            looking at. This chapter is about Indian Funeral and other observations.
                            Having the name Kihiargo meantioned near bury and also the name Tomio,
                            who is meantioned in the chapter may suggest they are about the same
                            voyage.</note></bibl><bibl><author>NA</author><title>A new, authentic, and complete collection of voyages round the world,

                            as it is also in Book I chapter XIV. This is a good indicator that they
                            are actually talking about the same person and would maybe help support
                            what we are looking for. Also the use of islanders and Tubourai Tamaide
                            were meantioned in the short passage in this search for Kihiargo.
                            Tubourai Tamaide was a common name meantioned throughout chapter XIV in
                            relation to the funeral and general observations.</note></bibl><bibl><author/><title/><editor/><publisher/><pubPlace/><date/><note><!--Describe the way the term is used: distortion from the original?
