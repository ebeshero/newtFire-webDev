	  more perhaps than, were I to enlarge upon it, would seem to accord
	  with my lowly condition. Whereby, among people of discernment
	  to whose knowledge it had come, I had much praise and high
	  esteem, but nevertheless extreme discomfort and suffering, not indeed
	  by reason of cruelty on the part of the beloved lady, but through
	  superabundant ardour engendered in the soul by ill-bridled desire;
	  the which, as it allowed me no reasonable period of quiescence,
	  frequently occasioned me an inordinate distress. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p99990004"/>In which distress
	  so much relief was afforded me by the delectable discourse of a friend
	  and his commendable consolations, that I entertain a very solid
	  conviction that to them I owe it that I am not dead. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p99990005"/>But, as it
	  pleased Him, who, being infinite, has assigned by immutable law an
	  end to all things mundane, my love, beyond all other fervent, and
	  neither to be broken nor bent by any force of determination, or
	  counsel of prudence, or fear of manifest shame or ensuing danger,
	  <pb n="2"/>did nevertheless in course of time abate of its own accord, in such
	  wise that it has now left nought of itself in my mind but that
	  pleasure which it is wont to afford to him who does not adventure
	  too far out in navigating its deep seas; so that, whereas it was used
	  to be grievous, now, all discomfort being done away, I find that
	  which remains to be delightful. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p99990006"/>But the cessation of the pain has
	  not banished the memory of the kind offices done me by those who
	  shared by sympathy the burden of my griefs; nor will it ever, I
	  believe, pass from me except by death. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p99990007"/>And as among the virtues
	  gratitude is in my judgment most especially to be commended,
	  and ingratitude in equal measure to be censured, therefore, that I
	  show myself not ungrateful, I have resolved, now that I may call
	  myself free, to endeavour, in return for what I have received, to
	  afford, so far as in me lies, some solace, if not to those who succoured
	  me, and who, perchance, by reason of their good sense or good
	  fortune, need it not, at least to such as may be apt to receive it.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p99990008"/>And though my support or comfort, so to say, may be of little
	  avail to the needy, nevertheless it seems to me meet to offer it most
	  readily where the need is most apparent, because it will there be
	  most serviceable and also most kindly received. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p99990009"/>Who will deny, that
	  it should be given, for all that it may be worth, to gentle ladies
	  much rather than to men? <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p99990010"/>Within their soft bosoms, betwixt fear
	  and shame, they harbour secret fires of love, and how much of
	  strength concealment adds to those fires, they know who have proved
	  it. Moreover, restrained by the will, the caprice, the commandment
	  of fathers, mothers, brothers, and husbands, confined most part of
	  their time within the narrow compass of their chambers, they live,
	  so to say, a life of vacant ease, and, yearning and renouncing in the
	  same moment, meditate divers matters which cannot all be cheerful.
	  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p99990011"/>If thereby a melancholy bred of amorous desire make entrance into
	  their minds, it is like to tarry there to their sore distress, unless it be
	  dispelled by a change of ideas. Besides which they have much less
	  power to support such a weight than men. For, when men are
	  enamoured, their case is very different, as we may readily perceive.
	  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p99990012"/>They, if they are afflicted by a melancholy and heaviness of mood,
	  have many ways of relief and diversion; they may go where they
	  will, may hear and see many things, may hawk, hunt, fish, ride, play
	  or traffic. By which means all are able to compose their minds,
	  <pb n="3"/>either in whole or in part, and repair the ravage wrought by the
	  dumpish mood, at least for some space of time; and shortly after, by
	  one way or another, either solace ensues, or the dumps become less
	  grievous. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p99990013"/>Wherefore, in some measure to compensate the injustice
	  of Fortune, which to those whose strength is least, as we see it to be
	  in the delicate frames of ladies, has been most niggard of support, I,
	  for the succour and diversion of such of them as love (for others
	  may find sufficient solace in the needle and the spindle and the reel),
	  do intend to recount one hundred Novels or Fables or Parables or
	  Stories, as we may please to call them, which were recounted in ten
	  days by an honourable company of seven ladies and three young men
	  in the time of the late mortal pestilence, as also some canzonets sung
	  by the said ladies for their delectation. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p99990014"/>In which pleasant novels
	  will be found some passages of love rudely crossed, with other
	  courses of events of which the issues are felicitous, in times as well
	  modern as ancient: from which stories the said ladies, who shall read
	  them, may derive both pleasure from the entertaining matters set
	  forth therein, and also good counsel, in that they may learn what to
	  shun, and likewise what to pursue. Which cannot, I believe, come
	  to pass, unless the dumps be banished by diversion of mind. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p99990015"/>And if
	  it so happen (as God grant it may) let them give thanks to Love,
	  who, liberating me from his fetters, has given me the power to
	  devote myself to their gratification.</p></div></front><!-- **************************************************************** --><body><pb n="4"/><!--Days--><div type="Day" corresp="day01"><head>First Day</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01990001"/>Beginneth here the first day of the Decameron, in which,

 you are by nature one and all, I do not disguise from
 myself that the present work must seem to you to have but a
 heavy and distressful prelude, in that it bears upon its very front
 what must needs revive the sorrowful memory of the late mortal
 pestilence, the course whereof was grievous not merely to eyewitnesses
 but to all who in any other wise had cognisance of it.
      <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980003"/>But I would have you know, that you need not therefore be fearful
 to read further, as if your reading were ever to be accompanied
 by sighs and tears. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980004"/>This horrid beginning will be to you even
 such as to wayfarers is a steep and rugged mountain, beyond which
 stretches a plain most fair and delectable, which the toil of the ascent
 and descent does but serve to render more agreeable to them; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980005"/>for, as
 the last degree of joy brings with it sorrow, so misery has ever its
 sequel of happiness. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980006"/>To this brief exordium of woe--brief, I say,
 inasmuch as it can be put within the compass of a few letters--succeed
 forthwith the sweets and delights which I have promised you, and
 which, perhaps, had I not done so, were not to have been expected
 from it. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980007"/>In truth, had it been honestly possible to guide you whither
 I would bring you by a road less rough than this will be, I would
 gladly have so done. But, because without this review of the past, it
 would not be in my power to shew how the matters, of which you
 <pb n="5"/>will hereafter read, came to pass, I am almost bound of necessity to
 enter upon it, if I would write of them at all.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980008"/>I say, then, that the years of the beatific incarnation of the Son
 of God had reached the tale of one thousand three hundred and
 forty-eight, when in the illustrious city of <placeName>Florence</placeName>, the fairest of all
 the cities of <placeName>Italy</placeName>, there made its appearance that deadly pestilence,
 which, whether disesminated by the influence of the celestial bodies,
 or sent upon us mortals by God in His just wrath by way of
 retribution for our iniquities, had had its origin some years before in
 the East, whence, after destroying an innumerable multitude of living
 beings, it had propagated itself without respite from place to place,
 and so, calamitously, had spread into the West.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980009"/>In <placeName>Florence</placeName>, despite all that human wisdom and forethought could
 devise to avert it, as the cleansing of the city from many impurities
 by officials appointed for the purpose, the refusal of entrance to all
 sick folk, and the adoption of many precautions for the preservation
 of health; despite also humble supplications addressed to God, and
 often repeated both in public procession and otherwise, by the devout;
 towards the beginning of the spring of the said year the doleful
 effects of the pestilence began to be horribly apparent by symptoms
 that shewed as if miraculous.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980010"/>Not such were they as in the East, where an issue of blood from
 the nose was a manifest sign of inevitable death; but in men and
 women alike it first betrayed itself by the emergence of certain
 tumours in the groin or the armpits, some of which grew as large as
 a common apple, others as an egg, some more, some less, which the
 common folk called gavoccioli. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980011"/>From the two said parts of the
 body this deadly gavocciolo soon began to propagate and spread itself
 in all directions indifferently; after which the form of the malady
 began to change, black spots or livid making their appearance in
 many cases on the arm or the thigh or elsewhere, now few and large,
 now minute and numerous. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980012"/>And as the gavocciolo had been and
 still was an infallible token of approaching death, such also were
 these spots on whomsoever they shewed themselves. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980013"/>Which maladies
 seemed to set entirely at naught both the art of the physician and
 the virtues of physic; indeed, whether it was that the disorder was
 of a nature to defy such treatment, or that the physicians were at
 fault--besides the qualified there was now a multitude both of men
 <pb n="6"/>and of women who practised without having received the slightest
 tincture of medical science--and, being in ignorance of its source,
 failed to apply the proper remedies; in either case, not merely were
 those that recovered few, but almost all within three days from the
 appearance of the said symptoms, sooner or later, died, and in most
 cases without any fever or other attendant malady.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980014"/>Moreover, the virulence of the pest was the greater by reason that
 intercourse was apt to convey it from the sick to the whole, just as
 fire devours things dry or greasy when they are brought close to it.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980015"/>Nay, the evil went yet further, for not merely by speech or association
 with the sick was the malady communicated to the healthy with
 consequent peril of common death; but any that touched the clothes
 of the sick or aught else that had been touched or used by them,
 seemed thereby to contract the disease.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980016"/>So marvellous sounds that which I have now to relate, that, had
 not many, and I among them, observed it with their own eyes, I had
 hardly dared to credit it, much less to set it down in writing, though
 I had had it from the lips of a credible witness.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980017"/>I say, then, that such was the energy of the contagion of the said
 pestilence, that it was not merely propagated from man to man,
 but, what is much more startling, it was frequently observed, that
 things which had belonged to one sick or dead of the disease, if
 touched by some other living creature, not of the human species,
 were the occasion, not merely of sickening, but of an almost instantaneous
 death. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980018"/>Whereof my own eyes (as I said a little before) had
 cognisance, one day among others, by the following experience. The
 rags of a poor man who had died of the disease being strewn about
 the open street, two hogs came thither, and after, as is their wont,
 no little trifling with their snouts, took the rags between their
 teeth and tossed them to and fro about their chaps; whereupon,
 almost immediately, they gave a few turns, and fell down dead,
 as if by poison, upon the rags which in an evil hour they had
 disturbed.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980019"/>In which circumstances, not to speak of many others of a similar
 or even graver complexion, divers apprehensions and imaginations
 were engendered in the minds of such as were left alive, inclining
 almost all of them to the same harsh resolution, to wit, to shun and
 abhor all contact with the sick and all that belonged to them,
 <pb n="7"/>thinking thereby to make each his own health secure. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980020"/>Among whom
 there were those who thought that to live temperately and avoid all
 excess would count for much as a preservative against seizures of this
 kind. Wherefore they banded together, and, dissociating themselves
 from all others, formed communities in houses where there were no
 sick, and lived a separate and secluded life, which they regulated with
 the utmost care, avoiding every kind of luxury, but eating and
 drinking very moderately of the most delicate viands and the finest
 wines, holding converse with none but one another, lest tidings of
 sickness or death should reach them, and diverting their minds with
 music and such other delights as they could devise. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980021"/>Others, the bias
 of whose minds was in the opposite direction, maintained, that to
 drink freely, frequent places of public resort, and take their pleasure
 with song and revel, sparing to satisfy no appetite, and to laugh and
 mock at no event, was the sovereign remedy for so great an evil: and
 that which they affirmed they also put in practice, so far as they were
 able, resorting day and night, now to this tavern, now to that, drinking
 with an entire disregard of rule or measure, and by preference making
 the houses of others, as it were, their inns, if they but saw in them
 aught that was particularly to their taste or liking; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980022"/>which they were
 readily able to do, because the owners, seeing death imminent, had
 become as reckless of their property as of their lives; so that most of
 the houses were open to all comers, and no distinction was observed
 between the stranger who presented himself and the rightful lord.
 Thus, adhering ever to their inhuman determination to shun the sick,
 as far as possible, they ordered their life. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980023"/>In this extremity of our
 city's suffering and tribulation the venerable authority of laws,
 human and divine, was abased and all but totally dissolved, for lack
 of those who should have administered and enforced them, most of
 whom, like the rest of the citizens, were either dead or sick, or so
 hard bested for servants that they were unable to execute any
 office; whereby every man was free to do what was right in his
 own eyes.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980024"/>Not a few there were who belonged to neither of the two said
 parties, but kept a middle course between them, neither laying the
 same restraint upon their diet as the former, nor allowing themselves
 the same license in drinking and other dissipations as the latter, but
 living with a degree of freedom sufficient to satisfy their appetites,
 <pb n="8"/>and not as recluses. They therefore walked abroad, carrying in
 their hands flowers or fragrant herbs or divers sorts of spices, which
 they frequently raised to their noses, deeming it an excellent thing
 thus to comfort the brain with such perfumes, because the air seemed
 to be everywhere laden and reeking with the stench emitted by the
 dead and the dying, and the odours of drugs.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980025"/>Some again, the most sound, perhaps, in judgment, as they were
 also the most harsh in temper, of all, affirmed that there was no
 medicine for the disease superior or equal in efficacy to flight; following
 which prescription a multitude of men and women, negligent
 of all but themselves, deserted their city, their houses, their estates,
 their kinsfolk, their goods, and went into voluntary exile, or migrated
 to the country parts, as if God in visiting men with this pestilence in
 requital of their iniquities would not pursue them with His wrath
 wherever they might be, but intended the destruction of such alone
 as remained within the circuit of the walls of the city; or deeming,
 perchance, that it was now time for all to flee from it, and that its
 last hour was come.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980026"/>Of the adherents of these divers opinions not all died, neither did
 all escape; but rather there were, of each sort and in every place, many
 that sickened, and by those who retained their health were treated after
 the example which they themselves, while whole, had set, being everywhere
 left to languish in almost total neglect. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980027"/>Tedious were it to
 recount, how citizen avoided citizen, how among neighbours was
 scarce found any that shewed fellow-feeling for another, how kinsfolk
 held aloof, and never met, or but rarely; enough that this sore affliction
 entered so deep into the minds of men and women, that in the
 horror thereof brother was forsaken by brother, nephew by uncle,
 brother by sister, and oftentimes husband by wife; nay, what is more,
 and scarcely to be believed, fathers and mothers were found to abandon
 their own children, untended, unvisited, to their fate, as if they had
 been strangers. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980028"/>Wherefore the sick of both sexes, whose number
 could not be estimated, were left without resource but in the charity
 of friends (and few such there were), or the interest of servants, who
 were hardly to be had at high rates and on unseemly terms, and
 being, moreover, one and all, men and women of gross understanding,
 and for the most part unused to such offices, concerned themselves
 no further than to supply the immediate and expressed wants of the
 <pb n="9"/>sick, and to watch them die; in which service they themselves not
 seldom perished with their gains. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980029"/>In consequence of which dearth
 of servants and dereliction of the sick by neighbours, kinsfolk and
 friends, it came to pass--a thing, perhaps, never before heard of--that
 no woman, however dainty, fair or well-born she might be,
 shrank, when stricken with the disease, from the ministrations of a
 man, no matter whether he were young or no, or scrupled to expose
 to him every part of her body, with no more shame than if he had
 been a woman, submitting of necessity to that which her malady
 required; wherefrom, perchance, there resulted in after time some
 loss of modesty in such as recovered. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980030"/>Besides which many succumbed,
 who with proper attendance, would, perhaps, have escaped
 death; so that, what with the virulence of the plague and the lack
 of due tendance of the sick, the multitude of the deaths, that daily
 and nightly took place in the city, was such that those who heard
 the tale--not to say witnessed the fact--were struck dumb with
      amazement. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980031"/>Whereby, practices contrary to the former habits of
 the citizens could hardly fail to grow up among the survivors.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980032"/>It had been, as to-day it still is, the custom for the women that
 were neighbours and of kin to the deceased to gather in his house
 with the women that were most closely connected with him, to
 wail with them in common, while on the other hand his male kinsfolk
 and neighbours, with not a few of the other citizens, and a due
 proportion of the clergy according to his quality, assembled without,
 in front of the house, to receive the corpse; and so the dead man
 was borne on the shoulders of his peers, with funeral pomp of taper
 and dirge, to the church selected by him before his death. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980033"/>Which
 rites, as the pestilence waxed in fury, were either in whole or in
 great part disused, and gave way to others of a novel order. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980034"/>For
 not only did no crowd of women surround the bed of the dying, but
 many passed from this life unregarded, and few indeed were they to
 whom were accorded the lamentations and bitter tears of sorrowing
 relations; nay, for the most part, their place was taken by the laugh,
 the jest, the festal gathering; observances which the women, domestic
 piety in large measure set aside, had adopted with very great
 advantage to their health. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980035"/>Few also there were whose bodies were
 attended to the church by more than ten or twelve of their neighbours,
 and those not the honourable and respected citizens; but a sort
 <pb n="10"/>of corpse-carriers drawn from the baser ranks, who called themselves
 becchini<note>Probably from the name of the pronged or hooked implement
 with
 which they dragged the corpses out of the houses.</note> and performed such
 offices for hire, would shoulder the
 bier, and with hurried steps carry it, not to the church of the dead
 man's choice, but to that which was nearest at hand, with four or
 six priests in front and a candle or two, or, perhaps, none; nor did
 the priests distress themselves with too long and solemn an office,
 but with the aid of the becchini hastily consigned the corpse to the
 first tomb which they found untenanted. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980036"/>The condition of the
 lower, and, perhaps, in great measure of the middle ranks, of the
 people shewed even worse and more deplorable; for, deluded by
 hope or constrained by poverty, they stayed in their quarters, in their
 houses, where they sickened by thousands a day, and, being without
 service or help of any kind, were, so to speak, irredeemably devoted
 to the death which overtook them. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980037"/>Many died daily or nightly in
 the public streets; of many others, who died at home, the departure
 was hardly observed by their neighbours, until the stench of their
 putrefying bodies carried the tidings; and what with their corpses
 and the corpses of others who died on every hand the whole place
 was a sepulchre.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980038"/>It was the common practice of most of the neighbours, moved no
 less by fear of contamination by the putrefying bodies than by charity
 towards the deceased, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980039"/>to drag the corpses out of the houses with their
 own hands, aided, perhaps, by a porter, if a porter was to be had, and
 to lay them in front of the doors, where any one who made the
 round might have seen, especially in the morning, more of them than
 he could count; afterwards they would have biers brought up, or, in
 default, planks, whereon they laid them. Nor was it once or twice
 only that one and the same bier carried two or three corpses at once;
 but quite a considerable number of such cases occurred, one bier
 sufficing for husband and wife, two or three brothers, father and son,
 and so forth. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980040"/>And times without number it happened, that, as two
 priests, bearing the cross, were on their way to perform the last office
 for some one, three or four biers were brought up by the porters in
 rear of them, so that, whereas the priests supposed that they had
 but one corpse to bury, they discovered that there were six or
 eight, or sometimes more. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980041"/>Nor, for all their number, were their
 <pb n="11"/>obsequies honoured by either tears or lights or crowds of mourners;
 rather, it was come to this, that a dead man was then of no more
 account than a dead goat would be to-day. From all which it is
 abundantly manifest, that that lesson of patient resignation, which
 the sages were never able to learn from the slight and infrequent
 mishaps which occur in the natural course of events, was now brought
 home even to the minds of the simple by the magnitude of their
 disasters, so that they became indifferent to them.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980042"/>As consecrated ground there was not in extent sufficient to
 provide tombs for the vast multitude of corpses which day and night,
 and almost every hour, were brought in eager haste to the churches
 for interment, least of all, if ancient custom were to be observed and
 a separate resting-place assigned to each, they dug, for each graveyard,
 as soon as it was full, a huge trench, in which they laid the
 corpses as they arrived by hundreds at a time, piling them up as
 merchandise is stowed in the hold of a ship, tier upon tier, each
 covered with a little earth, until the trench would hold no more.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980043"/>But I spare to rehearse with minute particularity each of the woes
 that came upon our city, and say in brief, that, harsh as was the
 tenor of her fortunes, the surrounding country knew no mitigation;
 for there--not to speak of the castles, each, as it were, a little city in
 itself--in sequestered village, or on the open champaign, by the wayside,
 on the farm, in the homestead, the poor hapless husbandmen
 and their families, forlorn of physicians' care or servants' tendance,
 perished day and night alike, not as men, but rather as beasts.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980044"/>Wherefore, they too, like the citizens, abandoned all rule of life, all
 habit of industry, all counsel of prudence; nay, one and all, as if
 expecting each day to be their last, not merely ceased to aid Nature
 to yield her fruit in due season of their beasts and their lands and
 their past labours, but left no means unused, which ingenuity could
 devise, to waste their accumulated store; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980045"/>denying shelter to their
 oxen, asses, sheep, goats, pigs, fowls, nay, even to their dogs, man's
 most faithful companions, and driving them out into the fields to
 roam at large amid the unsheaved, nay, unreaped corn. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980046"/>Many of
 which, as if endowed with reason, took their fill during the day, and
 returned home at night without any guidance of herdsman. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980047"/>But
 enough of the country! What need we add, but (reverting to the
 city) that such and so grievous was the harshness of heaven, and
 <pb n="12"/>perhaps in some degree of man, that, what with the fury of the
 pestilence, the panic of those whom it spared, and their consequent
 neglect or desertion of not a few of the stricken in their need, it is
 believed without any manner of doubt, that between March and the
 ensuing July upwards of a hundred thousand human beings lost their
 lives within the walls of the city of <placeName>Florence</placeName>, which before the
 deadly visitation would not have been supposed to contain so many
 people! <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980048"/>How many grand palaces, how many stately homes, how
 many splendid residences, once full of retainers, of lords, of ladies,
 were now left desolate of all, even to the meanest servant! How
 many families of historic fame, of vast ancestral domains, and wealth
 proverbial, found now no scion to continue the succession! How
 many brave men, how many fair ladies, how many gallant youths,
 whom any physician, were he Galen, Hippocrates, or Æsculapius
 himself, would have pronounced in the soundest of health, broke fast
 with their kinsfolk, comrades and friends in the morning, and when
 evening came, supped with their forefathers in the other world!</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980049"/>Irksome it is to myself to rehearse in detail so sorrowful a history.
 Wherefore, being minded to pass over so much thereof as I fairly
 can, I say, that our city, being thus well-nigh depopulated, it so
 happened, as I afterwards learned from one worthy of credit, that
 on a Tuesday morning after Divine Service the venerable church of
 <placeName>Santa Maria Novella</placeName> was almost deserted save for the presence of
 seven young ladies habited sadly in keeping with the season. All
 were connected either by blood or at least as friends or neighbours;
 and fair and of good understanding were they all, as also of noble
 birth, gentle manners, and a modest sprightliness. In age none
 exceeded twenty-eight, or fell short of eighteen years. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980050"/>Their names
 I would set down in due form, had I not good reason to withhold
 them, being solicitous lest the matters which here ensue, as told
 and heard by them, should in after time be occasion of reproach to
 any of them, in view of the ample indulgence which was then, for the
 reasons heretofore set forth, accorded to the lighter hours of persons of
 much riper years than they, but which the manners of to-day have
 somewhat restricted; nor would I furnish material to detractors,
 ever ready to bestow their bite where praise is due, to cast by invidious
 speech the least slur upon the honour of these noble ladies. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980051"/>Wherefore,
 that what each says may be apprehended without confusion, I
 <pb n="13"/>intend to give them names more or less appropriate to the character
 of each. The first, then, being the eldest of the seven, we will call
 <persName>Pampinea</persName>, the second <persName>Fiammetta</persName>, the third <persName>Filomena</persName>, the fourth
 <persName>Emilia</persName>, the fifth we will distinguish as <persName>Lauretta</persName>, the sixth as <persName>Neifile</persName>,
 and the last, not without reason, shall be named Elisa.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980052"/>'Twas not of set purpose but by mere chance that these ladies met
 in the same part of the church; but at length grouping themselves
 into a sort of circle, after heaving a few sighs, they gave up saying
 paternosters, and began to converse (among other topics) on the
 times.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980053"/>So they continued for a while, and then <persName>Pampinea</persName>, the rest listening
 in silent attention, thus began: <q>Dear ladies mine, often have I
 heard it said, and you doubtless as well as I, that wrong is done to
 none by whoso but honestly uses his reason. And to fortify, preserve,
 and defend his life to the utmost of his power is the dictate of natural
 reason in every one that is born. Which right is accorded in such
 measure that in defence thereof men have been held blameless in
 taking life. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980054"/>And if this be allowed by the laws, albeit on their
 stringency depends the well-being of every mortal, how much more
 exempt from censure should we, and all other honest folk, be in
 taking such means as we may for the preservation of our life? <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980055"/>As
 often as I bethink me how we have been occupied this morning, and
 not this morning only, and what has been the tenor of our conversation,
 I perceive--and you will readily do the like--that each of
 us is apprehensive on her own account; nor thereat do I marvel, but
 at this I do marvel greatly, that, though none of us lacks a woman's
 wit, yet none of us has recourse to any means to avert that which
 we all justly fear. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980056"/>Here we tarry, as if, methinks, for no other
 purpose than to bear witness to the number of the corpses that are
 brought hither for interment, or to hearken if the brothers there
 within, whose number is now almost reduced to nought, chant their
 offices at the canonical hours, or, by our weeds of woe, to obtrude on
 the attention of every one that enters, the nature and degree of our
 sufferings. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980057"/>And if we quit the church, we see dead or sick folk carried
 about,
 or we see those, who for their crimes were of late condemned to
 exile by the outraged majesty of the public laws, but who now, in
 contempt of those laws, well knowing that their ministers are a prey
 <pb n="14"/>to death or disease, have returned, and traverse the city in packs,
 making it hideous with their riotous antics; or else we see the refuse
 of the people, fostered on our blood, becchini, as they call themselves,
 who for our torment go prancing about here and there and everywhere,
 making mock of our miseries in scurrilous songs. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980058"/>Nor hear
 we aught but: Such and such are dead; or, Such and such are
 dying; and should hear dolorous wailing on every hand, were there
 but any to wail. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980059"/>Or go we home, what see we there? I know not
 if you are in like case with me; but there, where once were servants
 in plenty, I find none left but my maid, and shudder with terror, and
 feel the very hairs of my head to stand on end; and turn or tarry
 where I may, I encounter the ghosts of the departed, not with their
 wonted mien, but with something horrible in their aspect that appals
 me. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980060"/>For which reasons church and street and home are alike distressful
 to me, and the more so that none, methinks, having means and place
 of retirement as we have, abides here save only we; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980061"/>or if any such
 there be, they are of those, as my senses too often have borne witness,
 who make no distinction between things honourable and their
 opposites, so they but answer the cravings of appetite, and, alone or
 in company, do daily and nightly what things soever give promise of
 most gratification. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980062"/>Nor are these secular persons alone; but such as
 live recluse in monasteries break their rule, and give themselves up
 to carnal pleasures, persuading themselves that they are permissible
 to them, and only forbidden to others, and, thereby thinking to
 escape, are become unchaste and dissolute. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980063"/>If such be our circumstances--and
 such most manifestly they are--what do we here?
 what wait we for? what dream we of? why are we less prompt to
 provide for our own safety than the rest of the citizens? Is life less
 dear to us than to all other women? or think we that the bond
 which unites soul and body is stronger in us than in others, so that
 there is no blow that may light upon it, of which we need be
 apprehensive? <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980064"/>If so, we err, we are deceived. What insensate folly
 were it in us so to believe! We have but to call to mind the
 number and condition of those, young as we, and of both sexes, who
 have succumbed to this cruel pestilence, to find therein conclusive
 evidence to the contrary. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980065"/>And lest from lethargy or indolence we
 fall into the vain imagination that by some lucky accident we may
 in some way or another, when we would, escape--I know not if
 <pb n="15"/>your opinion accord with mine--I should deem it most wise in us,
 our case being what it is, if, as many others have done before us, and
 are still doing, we were to quit this place, and, shunning like death
 the evil example of others, betake ourselves to the country, and there
 live as honourable women on one of the estates, of which none of us
 has any lack, with all cheer of festal gathering and other delights, so
 long as in no particular we overstep the bounds of reason. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980066"/>There we
 shall hear the chant of birds, have sight of verdant hills and plains, of
 cornfields undulating like the sea, of trees of a thousand sorts; there
 also we shall have a larger view of the heavens, which, however harsh
 to usward, yet deny not their eternal beauty; things fairer far for
 epe to rest on than the desolate walls of our city. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980067"/>Moreover, we
 shall there breathe a fresher air, find ampler store of things meet for
 such as live in these times, have fewer causes of annoy. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980068"/>For, though
 the husbandmen die there, even as here the citizens, they are
 dispersed in scattered homesteads, and 'tis thus less painful to witness.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980069"/>Nor, so far as I can see, is there a soul here whom we shall desert;
 rather we may truly say, that we are ourselves deserted; for, our
 kinsfolk being either dead or fled in fear of death, no more regardful
 of us than if we were strangers, we are left alone in our great
 affliction. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980070"/>No censure, then, can fall on us if we do as I propose;
 and otherwise grievous suffering, perhaps death, may ensue. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980071"/>Wherefore,
 if you agree, 'tis my advice, that, attended by our maids with al???
 things needful, we sojourn, now on this, now on the other estate,
 and in such way of life continue, until we see--if death should not
 first overtake us--the end which Heaven reserves for these events.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980072"/>And I remind you that it will be at least as seemly in us to leave
 with honour, as in others, of whom there are not a few, to stay with
 dishonour.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980073"/>The other ladies praised <persName>Pampinea</persName>'s plan, and indeed were so
 prompt to follow it, that they had already begun to discuss the
 manner in some detail, as if they were forthwith to rise from their
 seats and take the road, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980074"/>when <persName>Filomena</persName>, whose judgment was
 excellent, interposed, saying: <q>Ladies, though <persName>Pampinea</persName> has spoken
 to most excellent effect, yet it were not well to be so precipitate as
 you seem disposed to be. Bethink you that we are all women; nor
 is there any here so young, but she is of years to understand how
 women are minded towards one another, when they are alone
 <pb n="16"/>together, and how ill they are able to rule themselves without the
 guidance of some man. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980075"/>We are sensitive, perverse, suspicious,
 pusillanimous and timid; wherefore I much misdoubt, that, if we
 find no other guidance than our own, this company is like to break
 up sooner, and with less credit to us, than it should. Against which
 it were well to provide at the outset.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980076"/>Said then Elisa: 
      <q>Without
 doubt man is woman's head, and, without man's governance, it is
 seldom that aught that we do is brought to a commendable conclusion.
 But how are we to come by the men? <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980077"/>Every one of us
 here knows that her kinsmen are for the most part dead, and that the
 survivors are dispersed, one here, one there, we know not where, bent
 each on escaping the same fate as ourselves; nor were it seemly to
 seek the aid of strangers; for, as we are in quest of health, we must
 find some means so to order matters that, wherever we seek diversion
 or repose, trouble and scandal do not follow us.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980078"/>While the ladies were thus conversing, there came into the church
 three young men, young, I say, but not so young that the age of the
 youngest was less than twenty-five years; in whom neither the
 sinister course of events, nor the loss of friends or kinsfolk, nor fear
 for their own safety, had availed to quench, or even temper, the
 ardour of their love. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980079"/>The first was called Pamfilo, the second
 <persName>Filostrato</persName>, and the third <persName>Dioneo</persName>. Very debonair and chivalrous
 were they all; and in this troublous time they were seeking if haply,
 to their exceeding great solace, they might have sight of their fair
 friends, all three of whom chanced to be among the said seven ladies,
 besides some that were of kin to the young men. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980080"/>At one and the
 same moment they recognised the ladies and were recognised by
 them: wherefore, with a gracious smile, <persName>Pampinea</persName> thus began:
 <q>Lo, fortune is propitious to our enterprise, having vouchsafed us the
 good offices of these young men, who are as gallant as they are
 discreet, and will gladly give us their guidance and escort, so we but
 take them into our service.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980081"/>Whereupon <persName>Neifile</persName>, crimson from brow
 to neck with the blush of modesty, being one of those that had a
 lover among the young men, said: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980082"/><q>For God's sake, <persName>Pampinea</persName>,
 have a care what you say. Well assured am I that nought but good
 can be said of any of them, and I deem them fit for office far more
 onerous than this which you propose for them, and their good and
 honourable company worthy of ladies fairer by far and more tenderly
 <pb n="17"/>to be cherished than such as we. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980083"/>But 'tis no secret that they love
 some of us here; wherefore I misdoubt that, if we take them with
 us, we may thereby give occasion for scandal and censure merited
 neither by us nor by them.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980084"/><q>That,</q> said <persName>Filomena</persName>, <q>is of no
 consequence;
 so I but live honestly, my conscience gives me no
 disquietude; if others asperse me, God and the truth will take arms
 in my defence. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980085"/>Now, should they be disposed to attend us, of a truth
 we might say with <persName>Pampinea</persName>, that fortune favours our enterprise.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980086"/>The silence which followed betokened consent on the part of the other
 ladies, who then with one accord resolved to call the young men, and
 acquaint them with their purpose, and pray them to be of their company.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980087"/>So without further parley <persName>Pampinea</persName>, who had a kinsman
 among the young men, rose and approached them where they stood
 intently regarding them; and greeting them gaily, she opened to them
 their plan, and besought them on the part of herself and her friends
 to join their company on terms of honourable and fraternal comradeship.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980088"/>At first the young men thought she did but trifle with them;
 but when they saw that she was in earnest, they answered with
 alacrity that they were ready, and promptly, even before they left
 the church, set matters in train for their departure. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980089"/>So all things
 meet being first sent forward in due order to their intended place
 of sojourn, the ladies with some of their maids, and the three young
 men, each attended by a man-servant, sallied forth of the city on
 the morrow, being Wednesday, about daybreak, and took the road;
 nor had they journeyed more than two short miles when they
 arrived at their destination. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980090"/>The estate<note>Identified by tradition with
 the Villa Palmieri (now Crawford) on the
 slope of <placeName>Fiesole</placeName>.</note> lay upon a little hill some
 distance from the nearest highway, and, embowered in shrubberies
 of divers hues, and other greenery, afforded the eye a pleasant
 prospect. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980091"/>On the summit of the hill was a palace with galleries,
 halls and chambers, disposed around a fair and spacious court, each
 very fair in itself, and the goodlier to see for the gladsome pictures
 with which it was adorned; the whole set amidst meads and gardens
 laid out with marvellous art, wells of the coolest water, and vaults of
 the finest wines, things more suited to dainty drinkers than to sober
 and honourable women. On their arrival the company, to their no
 small delight, found their beds already made, the rooms well swept
 <pb n="18"/>and garnished with flowers of every sort that the season could afford,
 and the floors carpeted with rushes. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980092"/>When they were seated,
 <persName>Dioneo</persName>, a gallant who had not his match for courtesy and wit, spoke
 thus: <q>My ladies, 'tis not our forethought so much as your own
 mother-wit that has guided us hither. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980093"/>How you mean to dispose
 of your cares I know not; mine I left behind me within the citygate
 when I issued thence with you a brief while ago. Wherefore,
 I pray you, either address yourselves to make merry, to laugh and
 sing with me (so far, I mean, as may consist with your dignity), or
 give me leave to hie me back to the stricken city, there to abide
 with my cares.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980094"/>To whom blithely <persName>Pampinea</persName> replied, as if she too
 had cast off all her cares: <q>Well sayest thou, <persName>Dioneo</persName>, excellent
 well; gaily we mean to live; 'twas a refuge from sorrow that here
 we sought, nor had we other cause to come hither. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980095"/>But, as no
 anarchy can long endure, I who initiated the deliberations of which
 this fair company is the fruit, do now, to the end that our joy may
 be lasting, deem it expedient, that there be one among us in chief
 authority, honoured and obeyed by us as our superior, whose
 exclusive care it shall be to devise how we may pass our time
 blithely. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980096"/>And that each in turn may prove the weight of the care,
 as well as enjoy the pleasure, of sovereignty, and, no distinction being
 made of sex, envy be felt by none by reason of exclusion from the
 office; I propose, that the weight and honour be borne by each one
 for a day; and let the first to bear sway be chosen by us all,
 those that follow to be appointed towards the vesper hour by him
 or her who shall have had the signory for that day; and let each
 holder of the signory be, for the time, sole arbiter of the place and
 manner in which we are to pass our time.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980097"/><persName>Pampinea</persName>'s speech was received with the utmost applause, and
 with one accord she was chosen queen for the first day. Whereupon
 <persName>Filomena</persName> hied her lightly to a bay-tree, having often heard of the
 great honour in which its leaves, and such as were deservedly
 crowned therewith, were worthy to be holden; and having gathered
 a few sprays, she made thereof a goodly wreath of honour, and set
 it on <persName>Pampinea</persName>'s head; which wreath was thenceforth, while
 their company endured, the visible sign of the wearer's sway and
 sovereignty.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980098"/>No sooner was Queen <persName>Pampinea</persName> crowned than she bade all be
 <pb n="19"/>silent. She then caused summon to her presence their four maids,
 and the servants of the three young men, and, all keeping silence,
 said to them: <q>That I may shew you all at once, how,
 well still giving place to better, our company may flourish and
 endure, as long as it shall pleasure us, with order meet and assured
 delight and without reproach, I first of all constitute <persName>Dioneo</persName>'s man,
 <persName>Parmeno</persName>, my seneschal, and entrust him with the care and control
 of all our household, and all that belongs to the service of the hall.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980099"/>Pamfilo's man, <persName>Sirisco</persName>, I appoint treasurer and chancellor of our
 exchequer; and be he ever answerable to <persName>Parmeno</persName>. While <persName>Parmeno</persName>
 and <persName>Sirisco</persName> are too busy about their duties to serve their masters,
 let <persName>Filostrato</persName>'s man, <persName>Tindaro</persName>, have charge of the chambers of all
 three. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980100"/>My maid, <persName>Misia</persName>, and <persName>Filomena</persName>'s maid, <persName>Licisca</persName>, will keep in
 the kitchen, and with all due diligence prepare such dishes as
 <persName>Parmeno</persName> shall bid them. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980101"/><persName>Lauretta</persName>'s maid, <persName>Chimera</persName>, and <persName>Fiammetta</persName>'s
 maid, <persName>Stratilia</persName> we make answerable for the ladies' chambers, and
 wherever we may take up our quarters, let them see that all is
 spotless. And now we enjoin you, one and all alike, as you value
 our favour, that none of you, go where you may, return whence
 you may, hear or see what you may, bring us any tidings but such as
 be cheerful.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980102"/>These orders thus succinctly given were received with
 universal approval. Whereupon <persName>Pampinea</persName> rose, and said gaily:
 <q>Here are gardens, meads, and other places delightsome enough,
 where you may wander at will, and take your pleasure; but on the
 stroke of tierce,<note>The canonical hour following prime, roughly speaking
 about 9 a.m.</note> let all be here to breakfast in the shade.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980103"/>Thus dismissed by their new queen the gay company sauntered
 gently through a garden, the young men saying sweet things to the
 fair ladies, who wove fair garlands of divers sorts of leaves and sang
 love-songs.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980104"/>Having thus spent the time allowed them by the queen, they
 returned to the house, where they found that <persName>Parmeno</persName> had entered
 on his office with zeal; for in a hall on the ground-floor they saw
 tables covered with the whitest of cloths, and beakers that shone
 like silver, and sprays of broom scattered everywhere. So, at the bidding
 of the queen, they washed their hands, and all took their places
 as marshalled by <persName>Parmeno</persName>. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980105"/>Dishes, daintily prepared, were served,
 <pb n="20"/>and the finest wines were at hand; the three serving-men did their
 office noiselessly; in a word all was fair and ordered in a seemly
 manner; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980106"/>whereby the spirits of the company rose, and they
 seasoned their viands with pleasant jests and sprightly sallies.
 Breakfast done, the tables were removed, and the queen bade fetch
 instruments of music; for all, ladies and young men alike, knew
 how to tread a measure, and some of them played and sang with
 great skill: so, at her command, <persName>Dioneo</persName> having taken a lute, and
 <persName>Fiammetta</persName> a viol, they struck up a dance in sweet concert; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980107"/>and,
 the servants being dismissed to their repast, the queen, attended by
 the other ladies and the two young men, led off a stately carol; which
 ended they fell to singing ditties dainty and gay. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980108"/>Thus they diverted
 themselves until the queen, deeming it time to retire to rest, dismissed
 them all for the night. So the three young men and the
 ladies withdrew to their several quarters, which were in different
 parts of the palace. There they found the beds well made, and
 abundance of flowers, as in the hall; and so they undressed, and
 went to bed.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980109"/>Shortly after none<note>The canonical hour following sext, <!--(i)-->i. e.<!--(/i)--> 3
 p.m.</note> the queen rose, and roused the rest of the
 ladies, as also the young men, averring that it was injurious to the
 health to sleep long in the daytime. They therefore hied them to
 a meadow, where the grass grew green and luxuriant, being nowhere
 scorched by the sun, and a light breeze gently fanned them. So at
 the queen's command they all ranged themselves in a circle on the
 grass, and hearkened while she thus spoke:</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980110"/><q>You mark that the sun is high, the heat intense, and the silence
 unbroken save by the cicalas among the olive-trees. It were therefore
 the height of folly to quit this spot at present. Here the air
 is cool and the prospect fair, and here, observe, are dice and chess.
 Take, then, your pleasure as you may be severally minded; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980111"/>but, if
 you take my advice, you will find pastime for the hot hours before
 us, not in play, in which the loser must needs be vexed, and
 neither the winner nor the onlooker much the better pleased, but
 in telling of stories, in which the invention of one may afford
 solace to all the company of his hearers. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980112"/>You will not each have
 told a story before the sun will be low, and the heat abated, so that
 <pb n="21"/>we shall be able to go and severally take our pleasure where it may
 seem best to each. Wherefore, if my proposal meet with your
 approval--for in this I am disposed to consult your pleasure--let us
 adopt it; if not, divert yourselves as best you may, until the vesper
 hour.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980113"/>The queen's proposal being approved by all, ladies and men alike,
 she added: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980114"/><q>So please you, then, I ordain, that, for this first day,
 we be free to discourse of such matters as most commend themselves
 to each in turn.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01980115"/>She then addressed Pamfilo, who sat on her

      begun
      in the holy and awful name of Him who was the maker of all. Wherefore,
      as it falls to me to lead the way in this your enterprise of storytelling,
      I intend to begin with one of His wondrous works, that, by
      hearing thereof, our hopes in Him, in whom is no change, may be
      established, and His name be by us forever lauded. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010003"/>'Tis manifest
      that, as things temporal are all doomed to pass and perish, so within
      and without they abound with trouble and anguish and travail, and
      are subject to infinite perils; nor, save for the especial grace of God,
      should we, whose being is bound up with and forms part of theirs,
      have either the strength to endure or the wisdom to combat their
      adverse influences. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010004"/>By which grace we are visited and penetrated
      (so we must believe) not by reason of any merit of our own, but
      solely out of the fulness of God's own goodness, and in answer to the
      prayers of those who, being mortal like ourselves, did faithfully
      observe His ordinances during their lives, and are now become
      blessed for ever with Him in heaven. To whom, as to advocates
      taught by experience all that belongs to our frailty, we, not daring,
      perchance, to present our petitions in the presence of so great a Judge,
      make known our requests for such things as we deem expedient for
      us. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010005"/>And of His mercy richly abounding to usward we have further
      proof herein, that, no keenness of mortal vision being able in any
      degree to penetrate the secret counsels of the Divine mind, it
      some<pb n="23"/>times,
      perchance, happens, that, in error of judgment, we make one
      our advocate before His Majesty, who is banished from His presence
      in eternal exile, and yet He to whom nothing is hidden, having
      regard rather to the sincerity of our prayers than to our ignorance or
      the banishment of the intercessor, hears us no less than if the intercessor
      were in truth one of the blest who enjoy the light of His
      countenance. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010006"/>Which the story that I am about to relate may serve
      to make apparent; apparent, I mean, according to the standard of
      the judgment of man, not of God.</p></body></floatingText><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010007"/>The story goes, then, that Musciatto Franzesi, a great and
      wealthy merchant, being made a knight in <placeName>France</placeName>, and being to
      attend Charles Sansterre, brother of the King of <placeName>France</placeName>, when he
      came into <placeName>Tuscany</placeName> at the instance and with the support of Pope
      Boniface, found his affairs, as often happens to merchants, to be
      much involved in divers quarters, and neither easily nor suddenly to
      be adjusted; wherefore he determined to place them in the hands of
      commissioners, and found no difficulty except as to certain credits
      given to some Burgundians, for the recovery of which he doubted
      whether he could come by a competent agent; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010008"/>for well he knew
      that the Burgundians were violent men and ill-conditioned and
      faithless; nor could he call to mind any man so bad that he could
      with confidence oppose his guile to theirs. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010009"/>After long pondering
      the matter, he recollected one Ser Ciapperello da <placeName>Prato</placeName>, who much
      frequented his house in <placeName>Paris</placeName>. Who being short of stature and very
      affected, the French who knew not the meaning of Cepparello,<note>The
	diminutive of ceppo, stump or log: more commonly written
	cepp<!--(i)-->e<!--(/i)-->rello (cf. p. 32) or ceppatello. The form ciapperello
	seems to be found only here.</note> 
      but supposed that it meant the same as Cappello, <!--(i)-->i. e.<!--(/i)--> garland, in their
      vernacular, called him not Cappello, but Ciappelletto by reason of his
      diminutive size; and as Ciappelletto he was known everywhere,
      whereas few people knew him as Ciapperello. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010010"/>Now Ciappelletto's
      manner of life was thus. He was by profession a notary, and his
      pride was to make false documents; he would have made them as
      often as he was asked, and more readily without fee than another
      at a great price; few indeed he made that were not false, and great
      was his shame when they were discovered. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010011"/>False witness he bore,
      solicited or unsolicited, with boundless delight; and, as oaths were in
      <pb n="24"/>those days had in very great respect in <placeName>France</placeName>, he, scrupling not to
      forswear himself, corruptly carried the day in every case in which he
      was summoned faithfully to attest the truth. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010012"/>He took inordinate
      delight, and bestirred himself with great zeal, in fomenting ill-feeling,
      enmities, dissensions between friends, kinsfolk and all other folk;
      and the more calamitous were the consequences the better he was
      pleased. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010013"/>Set him on murder, or any other foul crime, and he never
      hesitated, but went about it with alacrity; he had been known on
      more than one occasion to inflict wounds or death by preference
      with his own hands. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010014"/>He was a profuse blasphemer of God and His
      saints, and that on the most trifling occasions, being of all men the
      most irascible. He was never seen at church, held all the sacraments
      vile things, and derided them in language of horrible ribaldry.
      On the other hand he resorted readily to the tavern and other
      places of evil repute, and frequented them. He was as fond of
      women as a dog is of the stick: in the use against nature he had
      not his match among the most abandoned. He would have pilfered
      and stolen as a matter of conscience, as a holy man would make an
      oblation. Most gluttonous he was and inordinately fond of his
      cups, whereby he sometimes brought upon himself both shame and
      suffering. He was also a practised gamester and thrower of false
      dice. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010015"/>But why enlarge so much upon him? Enough that he was,
      perhaps, the worst man that ever was born.</p><p>The rank and power of Musciatto Franzesi had long been this
 reprobate's mainstay, serving in many instances to secure him considerate
 treatment on the part of the private persons whom he
 frequently, and the court which he unremittingly, outraged. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010016"/>So
 Musciatto, having bethought him of this Ser Cepparello, with whose
 way of life he was very well acquainted, judged him to be the very
 sort of person to cope with the guile of the Burgundians. He therefore
 sent for him, and thus addressed him: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010017"/><q>Ser Ciappelletto, I am,
 as thou knowest, about to leave this place for good; and among
 those with whom I have to settle accounts are certain Burgundians,
 very wily knaves; nor know I the man whom I could more fitly
 entrust with the recovery of my money than thyself. Wherefore, as
 thou hast nothing to do at present, if thou wilt undertake this
 business, I will procure thee the favour of the court, and give thee a
 reasonable part of what thou shalt recover.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010018"/>Ser Ciappelletto, being
 <pb n="25"/>out of employment, and by no means in easy circumstances, and
 about to lose Musciatto, so long his mainstay and support, without
 the least demur, for in truth he had hardly any choice, made his
 mind up and answered that he was ready to go. So the bargain was
 struck. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010019"/>Armed with the power of attorney and the royal letters
 commendatory, Ser Ciappelletto took leave of Messer Musciatto and
 hied him to <placeName>Burgundy</placeName>, where he was hardly known to a soul. He
 set about the business which had brought him thither, the recovery
 of the money, in a manner amicable and considerate, foreign to his
 nature, as if he were minded to reserve his severity to the last.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010020"/>While thus occupied, he was frequently at the house of two
 Florentine usurers, who treated him with great distinction out of
 regard for Messer Musciatto; and there it so happened that he fell
 sick. The two brothers forthwith placed physicians and servants in
 attendance upon him, and omitted no means meet and apt for the
 restoration of his health. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010021"/>But all remedies proved unavailing; for
 being now old, and having led, as the physicians reported, a disorderly
 life, he went daily from bad to worse like one stricken with a
 mortal disease. This greatly disconcerted the two brothers; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010022"/>and one
 day, hard by the room in which Ser Ciappelletto lay sick, they began
 to talk about him; saying one to the other: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010023"/><q>What shall we do
 with this man? We are hard bested indeed on his account. If we
 turn him out of the house, sick as he is, we shall not only incur grave
 censure, but shall evince a signal want of sense; for folk must know
 the welcome we gave him in the first instance, the solicitude with
 which we have had him treated and tended since his illness, during
 which time he could not possibly do aught to displease us, and yet
 they would see him suddenly turned out of our house sick unto
 death. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010024"/>On the other hand he has been so bad a man that he is sure
 not to confess or receive any of the Church's sacraments; and dying
 thus unconfessed, he will be denied burial in church, but will be cast out
 into some ditch like a dog; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010025"/>nay, 'twill be all one if he do confess, for
 such and so horrible have been his crimes that no friar or priest either
 will or can absolve him; and so, dying without absolution, he will
 still be cast out into the ditch. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010026"/>In which case the folk of these parts,
 who reprobate our trade as iniquitous and revile it all day long, and
 would fain rob us, will seize their opportunity, and raise a tumult,
 and make a raid upon our houses, crying: 'A way with these Lombard
 <pb n="26"/>dogs, whom the Church excludes from her pale;' and will certainly
 strip us of our goods, and perhaps take our lives also; so that in any
 case we stand to lose if this man die.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010027"/>Ser Ciappelletto, who, as we said, lay close at hand while they
	thus spoke, and whose hearing was sharpened, as is often the case,
	by his malady, overheard all that they said about him. So he called
	them to him, and said to them: <q>I would not have you disquiet
	  yourselves in regard of me, or apprehend loss to befall you by my
	  death. I have heard what you have said of me and have no doubt
	  that 'twould be as you say, if matters took the course you anticipate;
	  but I am minded that it shall be otherwise. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010028"/>I have committed so
	  many offences against God in the course of my life, that one more in
	  the hour of my death will make no difference whatever to the account.
	  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010029"/>So seek out and bring hither the worthiest and most holy friar you
	  can find, and leave me to settle your affairs and mine upon a sound
	  and solid basis, with which you may rest satisfied.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010030"/>The two brothers
	had not much hope of the result, but yet they went to a friary and
	asked for a holy and discreet man to hear the confession of a Lombard
	that was sick in their house, and returned with an aged man of just
	and holy life, very learned in the Scriptures, and venerable and held
	in very great and especial reverence by all the citizens. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010031"/>As soon as
	he had entered the room where Ser Ciappelletto was lying, and had
	taken his place by his side, he began gently to comfort him: then he
	asked him how long it was since he was confessed. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010032"/>Whereto Ser
	Ciappelletto, who had never been confessed, answered: <q>Father, it
	  is my constant practice to be confessed at least once a week, and
	  many a week I am confessed more often; but true it is, that, since I
	  have been sick, now eight days, I have made no confession, so sore
	  has been my affliction.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010033"/><q>Son,</q> said the friar, <q>thou hast well
	  done,
	  and well for thee, if so thou continue to do; as thou dost confess
	  so often, I see that my labour of hearkening and questioning will be
	  slight.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010034"/><q>Nay but, master friar,</q> said Ser Ciappelletto, <q>say not
	  so; I have not confessed so often but that I would fain make a
	  general confession of all my sins that I have committed, so far as
	  I can recall them, from the day of my birth to the present time;
	  and therefore I pray you, my good father, to question me precisely in
	  every particular just as if I had never been confessed. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010035"/>And spare me
	  not by reason of my sickness, for I had far rather do despite to my
	  <pb n="27"/>flesh than, sparing it, risk the perdition of my soul, which my Saviour
	  redeemed with His precious blood.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010036"/>The holy man was mightily delighted with these words, which
	seemed to him to betoken a soul in a state of grace. He therefore
	signified to Ser Ciappelletto his high approval of this practice; and
	then began by asking him whether he had ever sinned carnally with
	a woman. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010037"/>Whereto Ser Ciappelletto answered with a sigh: <q>My
	  father, I scruple to tell you the truth in this matter, fearing lest I sin
	  in vain-glory.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010038"/><q>Nay, but,</q> said the friar, <q>speak boldly; none
	  ever sinned by telling the truth, either in confession or otherwise.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010039"/><q>Then,</q> said Ser Ciappelletto, <q>as you bid me speak boldly, I will
	  tell you the truth of this matter. I am virgin even as when I issued
	  from my mother's womb.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010040"/><q>Now God's blessing on thee,</q> said the
	friar, <q>well done; and the greater is thy merit in that, hadst thou
	  so willed, thou mightest have done otherwise far more readily than
	  we who are under constraint of rule.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010041"/>He then proceeded to ask,
	whether he had offended God by gluttony. Whereto Ser Ciappelletto,
	heaving a heavy sigh, answered that he had frequently so offended;
	for, being wont to fast not only in Lent like other devout persons, but
	at least three days in every week, taking nothing but bread and water,
	he had quaffed the water with as good a gusto and as much enjoyment,
	more particularly when fatigued by devotion or pilgrimage, as great
	drinkers quaff their wine; and oftentimes he had felt a craving for
	such dainty dishes of herbs as ladies make when they go into the
	country, and now and again he had relished his food more than
	seemed to him meet in one who fasted, as he did, for devotion.
	<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010042"/><q>Son,</q> said the friar, <q>these sins are natural and very trifling; and
	  therefore I would not have thee burden thy conscience too much
	  with them. There is no man, however holy he may be, but must
	  sometimes find it pleasant to eat after a long fast and to drink after
	  exertion.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010043"/><q>O, my father,</q> said Ser Ciappelletto, <q>say not this to
	  comfort me. You know well that I know, that the things which are
	  done in the service of God ought to be done in perfect purity of
	  an unsullied spirit; and whoever does otherwise sins.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010044"/>The friar,
	well content, replied: <q>Glad I am that thou dost think so, and I
	  am mightily pleased with thy pure and good conscience which therein
	  appears; but tell me: hast thou sinned by avarice, coveting more
	  than was reasonable, or withholding more than was right?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010045"/><q>My
	  <pb n="28"/>father,</q> replied Ser Ciappelletto, <q>I would not have you disquiet
	  yourself, because I am in the house of these usurers: no part have
	  I in their concerns; nay, I did but come here to admonish and
	  reprehend them, and wean them from this abominable traffic; and
	  so, I believe, I had done, had not God sent me this visitation. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010046"/>But
	  you must know, that my father left me a fortune, of which I dedicated
	  the greater part to God; and since then for my own support and the
	  relief of Christ's poor I have done a little trading, whereof I have desired
	  to make gain; and all that I have gotten I have shared with God's
	  poor, reserving one half for my own needs and giving the other half
	  to them; and so well has my Maker prospered me, that I have ever
	  managed my affairs to better and better account.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010047"/><q>Well done,</q>
	said the friar; <q>but how? hast thou often given way to anger?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010048"/><q>Often indeed, I assure you,</q> said Ser Ciappelletto. <q>And who
	  could refrain therefrom, seeing men doing frowardly all day long,
	  breaking the commandments of God and recking nought of His
	  judgments? <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010049"/>Many a time in the course of a single day I had rather
	  be dead than alive, to see the young men going after vanity, swearing
	  and forswearing themselves, haunting taverns, avoiding the churches,
	  and in short walking in the way of the world rather than in God's
	  way.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010050"/><q>My son,</q> said the friar, <q>this is a righteous wrath; nor
	  could I find occasion therein to lay a penance upon thee. But did
	  anger ever by any chance betray thee into taking human life, or
	  affronting or otherwise wronging any?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010051"/><q>Alas,</q> replied Ser
	Ciappelletto, <q>alas, sir, man of God though you seem to me, how
	  come you to speak after this manner? If I had had so much
	  as the least thought of doing any of the things of which you speak,
	  should I believe, think you, that I had been thus supported or
	  God? These are the deeds of robbers and such like evil men, to
	  whom I have ever said, when any I saw: 'Go, God change your
	  heart.'</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010052"/>Said then the friar: <q>Now, my son, as thou hopest to
	  be blest of God, tell me, hast thou never borne false witness against
	  any, or spoken evil of another, or taken the goods of another without
	  his leave?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010053"/><q>Yes, master friar,</q> answered Ser Ciappelletto, <q>most
	  true it is that I have spoken evil of another; for I had once a neighbour
	  who without the least excuse in the world was ever beating his
	  wife, and so great was my pity of the poor creature, whom, when he
	  was in his cups, he would thrash as God alone knows how, that once I
	  <pb n="29"/>spoke evil of him to his wife's kinsfolk.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010054"/><q>Well, well,</q> said the
	friar, <q>thou tellest me thou hast been a merchant; hast thou ever
	  cheated any, as merchants use to do?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010055"/><q>I'faith, yes, master friar,</q>
	said Ser Ciappelletto; <q>but I know not who he was; only that he
	  brought me some money which he owed me for some cloth that
	  I had sold him, and I put it in a box without counting it, where
	  a month afterwards I found four farthings more than there should
	  have been, which I kept for a year to return to him, but not seeing
	  him again, I bestowed them in alms for the love of God.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010056"/><q>This,</q>
	said the friar, <q>was a small matter; and thou didst well to bestow
	  them as thou didst.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010057"/>The holy friar went on to ask him many
	other questions, to which he made answer in each case in this sort.
	Then, as the friar was about to give him absolution, Ser Ciappelletto
	interposed: <q>Sir, I have yet a sin to confess.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010058"/><q>What?</q> asked the
	friar. <q>I remember,</q> he said, <q>that I once caused my servant to
	  sweep my house on a Saturday after none; and that my observance
	  of Sunday was less devout than it should have been.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010059"/><q>O, my son,</q>
	said the friar, <q>this is a light matter.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010060"/><q>No,</q> said Ser Ciappelletto,
	<q>say not a light matter; for Sunday is the more to be had in honour
	  because on that day our Lord rose from the dead.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010061"/>Then said the
	holy friar: <q>Now is there aught else that thou hast done?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010062"/><q>Yes, master friar,</q> replied Ser Ciappelletto, <q>once by inadvertence
	  I spat in the church of God.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010063"/>At this the friar began to smile, and
	said: <q>My son, this is not a matter to trouble about; we, who are
	  religious, spit there all day long.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010064"/><q>And great impiety it is when
	  you so do,</q> replied Ser Ciappelletto, <q>for there is nothing that
	  is so worthy to be kept from all impurity as the holy temple in which
	  sacrifice is offered to God.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010065"/>More he said in the same strain, which I
	pass over; and then at last he began to sigh, and by and by to weep
	bitterly, as he was well able to do when he chose. 
	<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010066"/>And the friar demanding: 
	<q>My son, why weepest thou?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010067"/><q>Alas, master friar,</q> 
	answered Ser Ciappelletto, <q>a sin yet remains, which I have
	  never confessed, such shame were it to me to tell it; and as often as
	  I call it to mind, I weep as you now see me weep, being well assured
	  that God will never forgive me this sin.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010068"/>Then said the holy friar:
	<q>Come, come, son, what is this that thou sayst? If all the sins of
	  all the men, that ever were or ever shall be, as long as the world shall
	  endure, were concentrated in one man, so great is the goodness of
	  <pb n="30"/>God that He would freely pardon them all, were he but penitent and
	  contrite as I see thou art, and confessed them: wherefore tell me thy
	  sin with a good courage.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010069"/>Then said Ser Ciappelletto, still weeping
	bitterly: <q>Alas, my father, mine is too great a sin, and scarce can
	  I believe, if your prayers do not co-operate, that God will ever grant
	  me His pardon thereof.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010070"/><q>Tell it with a good courage,</q> said the
	friar; <q>I promise thee to pray God for thee.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010071"/>Ser Ciappelletto,
	however, continued to weep, and would not speak, for all the friar's
	encouragement. When he had kept him for a good while in suspense,
	he heaved a mighty sigh, and said: <q>My father, as you promise me
	  to pray God for me, I will tell it you. Know, then, that once, when I
	  was a little child, I cursed my mother;</q> and having so said he began
	again to weep bitterly. 
	<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010072"/><q>O, my son,</q> said the friar, <q>does this seem
	  to thee so great a sin? Men curse God all day long, and He pardons
	  them freely, if they repent them of having so done; and thinkest
	  thou He will not pardon thee this? Weep not, be comforted, for
	  truly, hadst thou been one of them that set Him on the Cross, with
	  the contrition that I see in thee, thou wouldst not fail of His pardon.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010073"/><q>Alas! my father,</q> rejoined Ser Ciappelletto, <q>what is this you
	  say? To curse my sweet mother that carried me in her womb
	  for nine months day and night, and afterwards on her shoulder

	  'tis too great a sin; nor will it be pardoned, unless you pray God
	  for me.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010074"/>The friar now perceiving that Ser Ciappelletto had nothing more
	to say, gave him absolution and his blessing, reputing him for a most
	holy man, fully believing that all that he had said was true. And
	who would not have so believed, hearing him so speak at the point
	of death? 
	<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010075"/>Then, when all was done, he said: <q>Ser Ciappelletto,
	  if God so will, you will soon be well; but should it so come to pass
	  that God call your blessed soul to Himself in this state of grace, is
	  it well pleasing to you that your body be buried in our convent?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010076"/><q>Yea, verily, master friar,</q> replied Ser Ciappelletto; <q>there would
	  I be, and nowhere else, since you have promised to pray God for
	  me; besides which I have ever had a special devotion to your order.
	  Wherefore I pray you, that, on your return to your convent, you
	  cause to be sent me that very Body of Christ, which you consecrate
	  in the morning on the altar; because (unworthy though I be) I
	  <pb n="31"/>purpose with your leave to take it, and afterwards the holy and
	  extreme unction, that, though I have lived as a sinner, I may die
	  at any rate as a Christian.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010077"/>The holy man said that he was greatly
	delighted, that it was well said of Ser Ciappelletto, and that
	he would cause the Host to be forthwith brought to him; and
	so it was.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010078"/>The two brothers, who much misdoubted Ser Ciappelletto's power
	to deceive the friar, had taken their stand on the other side of a
	wooden partition which divided the room in which Ser Ciappelletto
	lay from another, and hearkening there they readily heard and understood
	what Ser Ciappelletto said to the friar; and at times could
	scarce refrain their laughter as they followed his confession; and
	now and again they said one to another: 
	<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010079"/><q>What manner of man
	  is this, whom neither age nor sickness, nor fear of death, on the
	  threshold of which he now stands, nor yet of God, before whose
	  judgment-seat he must soon appear, has been able to turn from his
	  wicked ways, that he die not even as he has lived?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010080"/>But seeing that
	his confession had secured the interment of his body in church, they
	troubled themselves no further. 
	<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010081"/>Ser Ciappelletto soon afterwards
	communicated, and growing immensely worse, received the extreme
	unction, and died shortly after vespers on the same day on which he
	had made his good confession. 
	<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010082"/>So the two brothers, having from
	his own moneys provided the wherewith to procure him honourable
	sepulture, and sent word to the friars to come at even to observe the
	usual vigil, and in the morning to fetch the corpse, set all things
	in order accordingly. 
	<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010083"/>The holy friar who had confessed him, hearing
	that he was dead, had audience of the prior of the friary; a chapter
	was convened and the assembled brothers heard from the confessor's
	own mouth how Ser Ciappelletto had been a holy man, as had
	appeared by his confession, and were exhorted to receive the body
	with the utmost veneration and pious care, as one by which there
	was good hope that God would work many miracles. 
	<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010084"/>To this the
	prior and the rest of the credulous confraternity assenting, they went
	in a body in the evening to the place where the corpse of Ser
	Ciappelletto lay, and kept a great and solemn vigil over it; and in
	the morning they made a procession habited in their surplices and
	copes, with books in their hands and crosses in front; and chanting
	as they went, they fetched the corpse and brought it back to their
	<pb n="32"/>church with the utmost pomp and solemnity, being followed by
	almost all the folk of the city, men and women alike. 
	<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010085"/>So it was laid
	in the church, and then the holy friar who had heard the confession
	got up in the pulpit and began to preach marvellous things of Ser
	Ciappelletto's life, his fasts, his virginity, his simplicity and
	guilelessness and holiness; narrating among other matters that of which
	Ser Ciappelletto had made tearful confession as his greatest sin, and
	how he had hardly been able to make him conceive that God would
	pardon him; from which he took occasion to reprove his hearers;
	saying: <q>And you, accursed of God, on the least pretext, blaspheme
	  God and His Mother, and all the celestial court.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010086"/>And much
	beside he told of his loyalty and purity; and, in short, so wrought
	upon the people by his words, to which they gave entire credence,
	that they all conceived a great veneration for Ser Ciappelletto, and
	at the close of the office came pressing forward with the utmost
	vehemence to kiss the feet and the hands of the corpse, from which
	they tore off the cerements, each thinking himself blessed to have
	but a scrap thereof in his possession; and so it was arranged that
	it should be kept there all day long, so as to be visible and accessible
	to all. 
	<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010087"/>At nightfall it was honourably interred in a marble tomb
	in one of the chapels, where on the morrow, one by one, folk came
	and lit tapers and prayed and paid their vows, setting there the
	waxen images which they had dedicated. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010088"/>And the fame of Ciappelletto's
	holiness and the devotion to him grew in such measure that
	scarce any there was that in any adversity would vow aught to any
	saint but he, and they called him and still call him San Ciappelletto,
	affirming that many miracles have been and daily are wrought by
	God through him for such as devoutly crave his intercession.</p><floatingText type="frame"><body><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010089"/>So lived, so died Ser Cepperello da <placeName>Prato</placeName>, and came to be reputed
	a saint, as you have heard. Nor would I deny that it is possible that
	he is of the number of the blessed in the presence of God, seeing
	that, though his life was evil and depraved, yet he might in his last
	moments have made so complete an act of contrition that perchance
	God had mercy on him and received him into His kingdom. But,
	as this is hidden from us, I speak according to that which appears,
	and I say that he ought rather to be in the hands of the devil in hell
	than in Paradise. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010090"/>Which, if so it be, is a manifest token of the
	superabundance of the goodness of God to usward, inasmuch as He
	<pb n="33"/>regards not our error but the sincerity of our faith, and hearkens
	unto us when, mistaking one who is at enmity with Him for a
	friend, we have recourse to him, as to one holy indeed, as our intercessor
	for His grace. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01010091"/>Wherefore, that we of this gay company

 a great merchant, a large dealer in drapery, a good man, most loyal
 and righteous, his name Jehannot de Chevigny, between whom and
 a Jew, Abraham by name, also a merchant, and a man of great
 wealth, as also most loyal and righteous, there subsisted a very close
 friendship. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01020005"/>Now Jehannot, observing Abraham's loyalty and rectitude,
 began to be sorely vexed in spirit that the soul of one so
 worthy and wise and good should perish for want of faith. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01020006"/>Wherefore
 he began in a friendly manner to plead with him, that he should
 <pb n="35"/>leave the errors of the Jewish faith and turn to the Christian verity,
 which, being sound and holy, he might see daily prospering and
 gaining ground, whereas, on the contrary, his own religion was
 dwindling and was almost come to nothing. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01020007"/>The Jew replied that
 he believed that there was no faith sound and holy except the Jewish
 faith, in which he was born, and in which he meant to live and die;
 nor would anything ever turn him therefrom. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01020008"/>Nothing daunted,
 however, Jehannot some days afterwards began again to ply Abraham
 with similar arguments, explaining to him in such crude fashion as
 merchants use the reasons why our faith is better than the Jewish.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01020009"/>And though the Jew was a great master in the Jewish law, yet,
 whether it was by reason of his friendship for Jehannot, or that the
 Holy Spirit dictated the words that the simple merchant used, at any
 rate the Jew began to be much interested in Jehannot's arguments,
 though still too staunch in his faith to suffer himself to be converted.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01020010"/>But Jehannot was no less assiduous in plying him with argument
 than he was obstinate in adhering to his law, insomuch that at length
 the Jew, overcome by such incessant appeals, said: <q>Well, well,
 Jehannot, thou wouldst have me become a Christian, and I am
 disposed to do so, provided I first go to <placeName>Rome</placeName> and there see him
 whom thou callest God's vicar on earth, and observe what manner
 of life he leads and his brother cardinals with him; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01020011"/>and if such it
 be that thereby, in conjunction with thy words, I may understand
 that thy faith is better than mine, as thou hast sought to shew me,
 I will do as I have said: otherwise, I will remain as I am a Jew.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01020012"/>When Jehannot heard this, he was greatly distressed, saying to himself:
 <q>I thought to have converted him; but now I see that the
 pains which I took for so excellent a purpose are all in vain; for, if he
 goes to the court of <placeName>Rome</placeName> and sees the iniquitous and foul life which
 the clergy lead there, so far from turning Christian, had he been
 converted already, he would without doubt relapse into Judaism.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01020013"/>Then turning to Abraham he said: <q>Nay, but, my friend, why
 wouldst thou be at all this labour and great expense of travelling
 from here to <placeName>Rome</placeName>? to say nothing of the risks both by sea and by
 land which a rich man like thee must needs run. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01020014"/>Thinkest thou
 not to find here one that can give thee baptism? And as for any
 doubts that thou mayst have touching the faith to which I point thee,
 where wilt thou find greater masters and sages therein than here, to
 <pb n="36"/>resolve thee of any question thou mayst put to them? <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01020015"/>Wherefore
 in my opinion this journey of thine is superfluous. Think that the
 prelates there are such as thou mayst have seen here, nay, as much
 better as they are nearer to the Chief Pastor. And so, by my advice
 thou wilt spare thy pains until some time of indulgence, when I,
 perhaps, may be able to bear thee company.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01020016"/>The Jew replied:
 <q>Jehannot, I doubt not that so it is as thou sayst; but once and
 for all I tell thee that I am minded to go there, and will never otherwise
 do that which thou wouldst have me and hast so earnestly
 besought me to do.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01020017"/><q>Go then,</q> said Jehannot, seeing that his
 mind was made up, <q>and good luck go with thee;</q> and so he gave
 up the contest because nothing would be lost, though he felt sure
 that he would never become a Christian after seeing the court of
 <placeName>Rome</placeName>. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01020018"/>The Jew took horse, and posted with all possible speed
 to <placeName>Rome</placeName>; where on his arrival he was honourably received by his
 fellow Jews. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01020019"/>He said nothing to any one of the purpose for which
 he had come; but began circumspectly to acquaint himself with the
 ways of the Pope and the cardinals and the other prelates and all the
 courtiers; and from what he saw for himself, being a man of great
 intelligence, or learned from others, he discovered that without
 distinction of rank they were all sunk in the most disgraceful lewdness,
 sinning not only in the way of nature but after the manner
 of the men of Sodom, without any restraint of remorse or shame, in
 such sort that, when any great favour was to be procured, the influence
 of the courtesans and boys was of no small moment. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01020020"/>Moreover he
 found them one and all gluttonous, wine-bibbers, drunkards, and next
 after lewdness, most addicted to the shameless service of the belly,
 like brute beasts. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01020021"/>And, as he probed the matter still further, he
 perceived that they were all so greedy and avaricious that human, nay
 Christian blood, and things sacred of what kind soever, spiritualities
 no less than temporalities, they bought and sold for money; which
 traffic was greater and employed more brokers than the drapery trade
 and all the other trades of <placeName>Paris</placeName> put together; open simony and
 gluttonous excess being glosed under such specious terms as
 <q>arrangement</q>
 and <q>moderate use of creature comforts,</q> as if God could not
 penetrate the thoughts of even the most corrupt hearts, to say nothing
 of the signification of words, and would suffer Himself to be misled
 after the manner of men by the names of things. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01020022"/>Which matters,
 <pb n="37"/>with many others which are not to be mentioned, our modest and
 sober-minded Jew found by no means to his liking, so that, his
 curiosity being fully satisfied, he was minded to return to <placeName>Paris</placeName>; which
 accordingly he did. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01020023"/>There, on his arrival, he was met by Jehannot;
 and the two made great cheer together. Jehannot expected Abraham's
 conversion least of all things, and allowed him some days of rest before
 he asked what he thought of the Holy Father and the cardinals and
 the other courtiers. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01020024"/>To which the Jew forthwith replied: <q>I think
 God owes them all an evil recompense: I tell thee, so far as I was
 able to carry my investigations, holiness, devotion, good works or
 exemplary living in any kind was nowhere to be found in any clerk;
 but only lewdness, avarice, gluttony, and the like, and worse, if worse
 may be, appeared to be held in such honour of all, that (to my thinking)
 the place is a centre of diabolical rather than of divine activities.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01020025"/>To the best of my judgment, your Pastor, and by consequence all
 that are about him devote all their zeal and ingenuity and subtlety
 to devise how best and most speedily they may bring the Christian
 religion to nought and banish it from the world. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01020026"/>And because I see
 that what they so zealously endeavour does not come to pass, but
 that on the contrary your religion continually grows, and shines
 more and more clear, therein I seem to discern a very evident token
 that it, rather than any other, as being more true and holy than any
 other, has the Holy Spirit for its foundation and support. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01020027"/>For which
 cause, whereas I met your exhortations in a harsh and obdurate
 temper, and would not become a Christian, now I frankly tell you
 that I would on no account omit to become such. Go we then to
 the church, and there according to the traditional rite of your holy
 faith let me receive baptism.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01020028"/>Jehannot, who had anticipated a
 diametrically opposite conclusion, as soon as he heard him so speak,
 was the best pleased man that ever was in the world. So taking
 Abraham with him to <placeName>Notre Dame</placeName> he prayed the clergy there to
 baptise him. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01020029"/>When they heard that it was his own wish, they forthwith
 did so, and Jehannot raised him from the sacred font, and named
 him Jean; and afterwards he caused teachers of great eminence
 thoroughly to instruct him in our faith, which he readily learned,
 and afterwards practised in a good, a virtuous, nay, a holy life.</p></div><pb n="38"/><!--****************************************Novella 3*****************************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0103"><head>Novel III</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01030001"/><persName>Melchisedech</persName>, a Jew, by a story of three rings averts a

      himself Soldan of <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, and gained many victories over kings both
      Christian and Saracen, having in divers wars and by divers lavish
      displays of magnificence spent all his treasure, and in order to meet
      a certain emergency being in need of a large sum of money, and
      being at a loss to raise it with a celerity adequate to his necessity,
      <pb n="39"/>bethought him of a wealthy Jew, <persName>Melchisedech</persName> by name, who lent

      believed, able to accommodate him, but was so miserly that he would
      never do so of his own accord, nor was Saladin disposed to constrain him
      thereto. So great, however, was his necessity that, after pondering
      every method whereby the Jew might be induced to be compliant, at
      last he determined to devise a colourably reasonable pretext for extorting
      the money from him. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01030008"/>So he sent for him, received him affably,
      seated him by his side, and presently said to him: <q>My good man, I
	have heard from many people that thou art very wise, and of great
	discernment in divine things; wherefore I would gladly know of thee,
	which of the three laws thou reputest the true law, the law of the
	Jews, the law of the Saracens, or the law of the Christians?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01030009"/>The Jew,
      who was indeed a wise man, saw plainly enough that Saladin meant
      to entangle him in his speech, that he might have occasion to harass
      him, and bethought him that he could not praise any of the three laws
      above another without furnishing Saladin with the pretext which he
      sought. So, concentrating all the force of his mind to shape such an
      answer as might avoid the snare, he presently lit on what he sought,
      saying: 
      <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01030010"/><q>My lord, a pretty question indeed is this which you propound,
	and fain would I answer it; to which end it is apposite that
	I tell you a story, which, if you will hearken, is as follows: 
	<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01030011"/>If I
	mistake not, I remember to have often heard tell of a great and rich
	man of old time, who among other most precious jewels had in his
	treasury a ring of extraordinary beauty and value, which by reason
	of its value and beauty he was minded to leave to his heirs for ever;
	for which cause he ordained, that, whichever of his sons was found
	in possession of the ring as by his bequest, should thereby be designate
	his heir, and be entitled to receive from the rest the honour and
	homage due to a superior. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01030012"/>The son, to whom he bequeathed the
	ring, left it in like manner to his descendants, making the like
	ordinance as his predecessor. In short the ring passed from hand to
	hand for many generations; and in the end came to the hands of
	one who had three sons, goodly and virtuous all, and very obedient
	to their father, so that he loved them all indifferently. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01030013"/>The rule
	touching the descent of the ring was known to the young men, and
	each aspiring to hold the place of honour among them did all he
	could to persuade his father, who was now old, to leave the ring to
	<pb n="40"/>him at his death. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01030014"/>The worthy man, who loved them all equally, and
	knew not how to choose from among them a sole legatee, promised
	the ring to each in turn, and in order to satisfy all three, caused a
	cunning artificer secretly to make other two rings, so like the first,
	that the maker himself could hardly tell which was the true ring.
	So, before he died, he disposed of the rings, giving one privily to
	each of his sons; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01030015"/>whereby it came to pass, that after his decease each
	of the sons claimed the inheritance and the place of honour, and, his
	claim being disputed by his brothers, produced his ring in witness of
	right. And the rings being found so like one to another that it
	was impossible to distinguish the true one, the suit to determine the
	true heir remained pendent, and still so remains. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01030016"/>And so, my lord,
	to your question, touching the three laws given to the three peoples
	by God the Father, I answer: Each of these peoples deems itself to
	have the true inheritance, the true law, the true commandments of
	God; but which of them is justified in so believing, is a question
	which, like that of the rings, remains pendent.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01030017"/>The excellent
      adroitness with which the Jew had contrived to evade the snare
      which he had laid for his feet was not lost upon Saladin. He therefore
      determined to let the Jew know his need, and did so, telling him
      at the same time what he had intended to do, in the event of his
      answering less circumspectly than he had done.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01030018"/>Thereupon the Jew gave the Soldan all the accommodation that
      he required, which the Soldan afterwards repaid him in full. He
      also gave him most munificent gifts with his lifelong amity and a
      great and honourable position near his person.</p></div><pb n="41"/><!--****************************************Novella 4*****************************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0104"><head>Novel IV</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01040001"/>A monk lapses into a sin meriting the most severe punishment,

 severe chastisement.</p></body></floatingText><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01040004"/>In the not very remote district of <placeName>Lunigiana</placeName> there flourished
 formerly a community of monks more numerous and holy than is
 there to be found to-day, among whom was a young brother, whose
 vigour and lustihood neither the fasts nor the vigils availed to subdue.
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01040005"/> One afternoon, while the rest of the confraternity slept, our young
 monk took a stroll around the church, which lay in a very sequestered
 spot, and chanced to espy a young and very beautiful girl, a
 daughter, perhaps, of one of the husbandmen of those parts, going
 through the fields and gathering herbs as she went. No sooner had
 <pb n="42"/>he seen her than he was sharply assailed by carnal concupiscence,
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01040006"/>insomuch that he made up to and accosted her; and (she hearkening)
 little by little they came to an understanding, and unobserved
 by any entered his cell together. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01040007"/>Now it so chanced that, while
 they fooled it within somewhat recklessly, he being overwrought
 with passion, the abbot awoke and passing slowly by the young
 monk's cell, heard the noise which they made within, and the better
 to distinguish the voices, came softly up to the door of the cell, and
 listening discovered that beyond all doubt there was a woman within.
 His first thought was to force the door open; but, changing his
 mind, he returned to his chamber and waited until the monk should
 come out.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01040008"/>Delightsome beyond measure though the monk found his
 intercourse with the girl, yet was he not altogether without anxiety.
 He had heard, as he thought, the sound of footsteps in the dormitory,
 and having applied his eye to a convenient aperture had had a good
 view of the abbot as he stood by the door listening. He was thus
 fully aware that the abbot might have detected the presence of a
 woman in the cell. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01040009"/>Whereat he was exceedingly distressed, knowing
 that he had a severe punishment to expect; but he concealed his
 vexation from the girl while he busily cast about in his mind for
 some way of escape from his embarrassment. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01040010"/>He thus hit on a novel
 stratagem which was exactly suited to his purpose. With the air of
 one who had had enough of the girl's company he said to her: <q>I
 shall now leave you in order that I may arrange for your departure
 hence unobserved. Stay here quietly until I return.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01040011"/>So out he
 went, locking the door of the cell, and withdrawing the key, which
 he carried straight to the abbot's chamber and handed to him, as was
 the custom when a monk was going out, saying with a composed air:
 <q>Sir, I was not able this morning to bring in all the faggots which I
 had made ready, so with your leave I will go to the wood and bring
 them in.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01040012"/>The abbot, desiring to have better cognisance of the
 monk's offence, and not dreaming that the monk knew that he had
 been detected, was pleased with the turn matters had taken, and
 received the key gladly, at the same time giving the monk the desired
 leave. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01040013"/>So the monk withdrew, and the abbot began to consider what
 course it were best for him to take, whether to assemble the brotherhood
 and open the door in their presence, that, being witnesses of
 <pb n="43"/>the delinquency, they might have no cause to murmur against him
 when he proceeded to punish the delinquent, or whether it were not
 better first to learn from the girl's own lips how it had come about.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01040014"/>And reflecting that she might be the wife or daughter of some man
 who would take it ill that she should be shamed by being exposed to
 the gaze of all the monks, he determined first of all to find out who
 she was, and then to make up his mind. So he went softly to the
 cell, opened the door, and, having entered, closed it behind him.
 The girl, seeing that her visitor was none other than the abbot, quite
 lost her presence of mind, and quaking with shame began to weep.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01040015"/>Master abbot surveyed her from head to foot, and seeing that she
 was fresh and comely, fell a prey, old though he was, to fleshly
 cravings no less poignant and sudden than those which the young
 monk had experienced, and began thus to commune with himself:
 <q>Alas! why take I not my pleasure when I may, seeing that I
 never need lack for occasions of trouble and vexation of spirit? Here
 is a fair wench, and no one in the world to know. If I can bring her
 to pleasure me, I know not why I should not do so. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01040016"/>Who will
 know? No one will ever know; and sin that is hidden is half
 forgiven; this chance may never come again; so, methinks, it were
 the part of wisdom to take the boon which God bestows.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01040017"/>So
 musing, with an altogether different purpose from that with which
 he had come, he drew near the girl, and softly bade her to be
 comforted, and besought her not to weep; and so little by little he
 came at last to show her what he would be at. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01040018"/>The girl, being
 made neither of iron nor of adamant, was readily induced to gratify
 the abbot, who after bestowing upon her many an embrace and
 kiss, got upon the monk's bed, where, being sensible, perhaps, of the
 disparity between his reverend portliness and her tender youth, and
 fearing to injure her by his excessive weight, he refrained from lying
 upon her, but laid her upon him, and in that manner disported
 himself with her for a long time. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01040019"/>The monk, who had only pretended
 to go to the wood, and had concealed himself in the dormitory,
 no sooner saw the abbot enter his cell than he was overjoyed to
 think that his plan would succeed; and when he saw that he had
 locked the door, he was well assured thereof. So he stole out of his
 hiding-place, and set his eye to an aperture through which he saw
 and heard all that the abbot did and said. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01040020"/>At length the abbot,
 <pb n="44"/>having had enough of dalliance with the girl, locked her in the cell
 and returned to his chamber. Catching sight of the monk soon
 afterwards, and supposing him to have returned from the wood,
 he determined to give him a sharp reprimand and have him
 imprisoned, that he might thus secure the prey for himself alone.
 He therefore caused him to be summoned, chid him very severely and
 with a stern countenance, and ordered him to be put in prison. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01040021"/>The
 monk replied trippingly: <q>Sir, I have not been so long in the order
 of St. Benedict as to have every particular of the rule by heart; nor
 did you teach me before to-day in what posture it behoves the monk
 to have intercourse with women, but limited your instruction to such
 matters as fasts and vigils. As, however, you have now given me
 my lesson, I promise you, if you also pardon my offence, that I will
 never repeat it, but will always follow the example which you have
 set me.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01040022"/>The abbot, who was a shrewd man, saw at once that the monk
 was not only more knowing than he, but had actually seen what he
 had done; nor, conscience-stricken himself, could he for shame mete
 out to the monk a measure which he himself merited. So pardon
 given, with an injunction to bury what had been seen in silence,
 they decently conveyed the young girl out of the monastery, whither,
 it is to be believed, they now and again caused her to return.</p></div><pb n="45"/><!--****************************************Novella 5*****************************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0105"><head>Novel V</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01050001"/>The Marchioness of Monferrato by a banquet of hens

      <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01050006"/>Whose merits being canvassed at the court of
      Philippe le Borgne, on the eve of his departure from <placeName>France</placeName> on the

      <pb n="46"/>a couple comparable to the Marquis and his lady; in that, while the

      and honour was without a peer among all the other ladies of the

      the King of <placeName>France</placeName> that, though he had never seen the lady, he fell
      ardently in love with her, and, being to join the armada, resolved that
      his port of embarcation should be no other than <placeName>Genoa</placeName>, in order that,
      travelling thither by land, he might find a decent pretext for visiting
      the Marchioness, with whom in the absence of the Marquis he
      trusted to have the success which he desired; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01050008"/>nor did he fail to put
      his design in execution. Having sent his main army on before, he
      took the road himself with a small company of gentlemen, and, as
      they approached the territory of the Marquis, he despatched a courier
      to the Marchioness, a day in advance, to let her know that he
      expected to breakfast with her the next morning. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01050009"/>The lady, who
      knew her part and played it well, replied graciously, that he would
      be indeed welcome, and that his presence would be the greatest of
      all favours. She then began to commune with herself, what this
      might import, that so great a king should come to visit her in her
      husband's absence, nor was she so deluded as not to surmise that it
      was the fame of her beauty that drew him thither. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01050010"/>Nevertheless she
      made ready to do him honour in a manner befitting her high degree,
      summoning to her presence such of the retainers as remained in the
      castle, and giving all needful directions with their advice, except that
      the order of the banquet and the choice of the dishes she reserved
      entirely to herself. Then, having caused all the hens that could be
      found in the country-side to be brought with all speed into the castle,
      she bade her cooks furnish forth the royal table with divers dishes
      made exclusively of such fare. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01050011"/>The King arrived on the appointed
      day, and was received by the lady with great and ceremonious cheer.
      Fair and noble and gracious seemed she in the eyes of the King
      beyond all that he had conceived from the knight's words, so that he
      was lost in admiration and inly extolled her to the skies, his passion
      being the more inflamed in proportion as he found the lady surpass
      the idea which he had formed of her. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01050012"/>A suite of rooms furnished
      with all the appointments befitting the reception of so great a king,
      was placed at his disposal, and after a little rest, breakfast-time being
      come, he and the Marchioness took their places at the same table,
      <pb n="47"/>while his suite were honourably entertained at other boards according
      to their several qualities. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01050013"/>Many courses were served with no lack
      of excellent and rare wines, whereby the King was mightily pleased,
      as also by the extraordinary beauty of the Marchioness, on whom his
      eye from time to time rested. However, as course followed course,
      the King observed with some surprise, that, though the dishes were
      diverse, yet they were all but variations of one and the same fare, to
      wit, the pullet. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01050014"/>Besides which he knew that the domain was one
      which could not but afford plenty of divers sorts of game, and by
      forewarning the lady of his approach, he had allowed time for hunting;
      yet, for all his surprise, he would not broach the question more
      directly with her than by a reference to her hens; so, turning to her
      with a smile, he said: <q>Madam, do hens grow in this country
	without so much as a single cock?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01050015"/>The Marchioness, who perfectly
      apprehended the drift of the question, saw in it an opportunity,
      sent her by God, of evincing her virtuous resolution; so casting a
      haughty glance upon the King she answered thus: <q>Sire, no; but
	the women, though they may differ somewhat from others in dress
	and rank, are yet of the same nature here as elsewhere.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01050016"/>The 
      significance of the banquet of pullets was made manifest to the King
      by these words, as also the virtue which they veiled. He perceived
      that on a lady of such a temper words would be wasted, and that
      force was out of the question. Wherefore, yielding to the dictates
      of prudence and honour, he was now as prompt to quench, as he
      had been inconsiderate in conceiving, his unfortunate passion for the
      lady; 
      <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01050017"/>and fearing her answers, he refrained from further jesting with
      her, and dismissing his hopes devoted himself to his breakfast, which
      done, he disarmed suspicion of the dishonourable purpose of his visit
      by an early departure, and thanking her for the honour she had

 was in our city, not long ago, a friar minor, an inquisitor in
 matters of heresy, who, albeit he strove might and main to pass
 himself off as a holy man and tenderly solicitous for the integrity
 of the Christian Faith, as they all do, yet he had as keen a
 scent for a full purse as for a deficiency of faith. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01060005"/>Now it so
 chanced that his zeal was rewarded by the discovery of a good man
 far better furnished with money than with sense, who in an unguarded
 moment, not from defect of faith, but rather, perhaps, from
 excess of hilarity, being heated with wine, had happened to say to
 his boon companions, that he had a wine good enough for Christ
 Himself to drink. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01060006"/>Which being reported to the inquisitor, he,
 knowing the man to be possessed of large estates and a well-lined
 purse, set to work in hot haste, <q>cum gladiis et fustibus,</q> to bring
 all the rigour of the law to bear upon him, designing thereby not to
 lighten the load of his victim's misbelief, but to increase the weight of
 his own purse by the florins, which he might, as he did, receive from
 him. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01060007"/>So he cited him to his presence, and asked him whether what
 was alleged against him were true. The good man answered in the
 affirmative, and told him how it had happened. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01060008"/><q>Then,</q> said our

 thou made Christ a wine-bibber, and a lover of rare vintages, as if
 He were a sot, a toper and a tavern-haunter even as one of you. And
 thinkest thou now by a few words of apology to pass this off as a
 light matter? It is no such thing as thou supposest. Thou hast
 deserved the fire; and we should but do our duty, did we inflict it
 upon thee.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01060009"/>With these and the like words in plenty he upbraided
 him, bending on him meanwhile a countenance as stern as if
 Epicurus had stood before him denying the immortality of the soul.
 In short he so terrified him that the good man was fain to employ
 certain intermediaries to anoint his palms with a liberal allowance of
 St. John Goldenmouth's grease, an excellent remedy for the disease of
 avarice which spreads like a pestilence among the clergy, and notably
 among the friars minors, who dare not touch a coin, that he might
 deal gently with him. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01060010"/>And great being the virtue of this ointment,
 albeit no mention is made thereof by Galen in any part of his
 Medicines, it had so gracious an effect that the threatened fire gave
 place to a cross, which he was to wear as if he were bound for the
 emprise over seas; and to make the ensign more handsome the
 inquisitor ordered that it should be yellow upon a black ground.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01060011"/>Besides which, after pocketing the coin, he kept him dangling about
 him for some days, bidding him by way of penance hear mass every
 morning at <placeName>Santa Croce</placeName>, and afterwards wait upon him at the
 breakfast-hour, after which he was free to do as he pleased for the
 rest of the day. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01060012"/>All which he most carefully observed; and so it
 fell out that one of these mornings there were chanted at the mass
 at which he assisted the following words of the Gospel: You shall
 receive an hundredfold and shall possess eternal life. With these
 words deeply graven in his memory, he presented himself, as he was
 bidden, before the inquisitor, where he sate taking his breakfast, and
 being asked whether he had heard mass that morning, 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01060013"/>he promptly answered: <q>Yes, sir.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01060014"/>And being further asked: <q>Heardest
 thou aught therein, as to which thou art in doubt, or hast thou any
 question to propound?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01060015"/>the good man responded: <q>Nay indeed,
 doubt have I none of aught that I heard; but rather assured faith in
 the verity of all. One thing, however, I heard, which caused me to

 of the evil plight in which you must find yourselves in the other
 world.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01060016"/><q>And what,</q> said the inquisitor, <q>was the passage that so
 moved thee to commiserate us?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01060017"/><q>Sir,</q> rejoined the good man,
 <q>it was that passage in the Gospel which says: You shall receive
 an hundredfold.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01060018"/><q>You heard aright,</q> said the inquisitor; <q>but
 why did the passage so affect you?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01060019"/><q>Sir,</q> replied the good man,
 <q>I will tell you. Since I have been in attendance here, I have seen
 a crowd of poor folk receive a daily dole, now of one, now of two,

 in the other world, you will have so much that it will go hard
 but you are all drowned therein.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01060020"/>This raised a general laugh
 among those who sat at the inquisitor's table, whereat the inquisitor,
 feeling that their gluttony and hypocrisy had received a home-thrust,
 was very wroth, and, but that what he had already done had not
 escaped censure, would have instituted fresh proceedings against him
 in revenge for the pleasantry with which he had rebuked the baseness
 of himself and his brother friars; so in impotent wrath he bade

      and reprehension. Wherefore, though the worthy man did well

      But Messer Cane was possessed with the idea that whatever he

      but still he waited a while, not deeming it expedient to leave. 
      <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01070009"/>He
      had brought with him three rich and goodly robes, given him by
      other lords, that he might make a brave show at the festival, and
      when his host began to press for payment he gave him one of the
      robes; afterwards, there being still much outstanding against him, he
      must needs, if he would tarry longer at the inn, give the host the
      second robe; after which he began to live on the third, being minded
      to remain there, as long as it would hold out, in expectation of better

      elicit from him any pleasant retort: <q>What ails thee, <persName>Bergamino</persName>,
	that thou art still so melancholy? Let me know the reason why.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01070011"/>Whereupon <persName>Bergamino</persName>, without a moment's reflection, told the
      following story, which could not have fitted his own case more
      exactly if it had been long premeditated.</p><p><q type="novella">My lord, you must know that Primasso was a grammarian of great
	eminence, and excellent and quick beyond all others in versifying;
	whereby he waxed so notable and famous that, albeit he was not
	everywhere known by sight, yet there were scarce any that did not
	at least by name and report know who Primasso was. 
	<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01070012"/>Now it so
	<pb n="53"/>happened that, being once at <placeName>Paris</placeName> in straitened circumstances, as
	it was his lot to be most of his time by reason that virtue is little
	appreciated by the powerful, he heard speak of the Abbot of Cluny,
	who, except the Pope, is supposed to be the richest prelate, in regard
	of his vast revenues, that the Church of God can shew; and marvellous
	and magnificent things were told him of the perpetual court
	which the abbot kept, and how, wherever he was, he denied not to
	any that came there either meat or drink, so only that he preferred
	his request while the abbot was at table. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01070013"/>Which when
	Primasso heard, he determined to go and see for himself what
	magnificent state this abbot kept, for he was one that took great
	delight in observing the ways of powerful and lordly men; wherefore
	he asked how far from <placeName>Paris</placeName> was the abbot then sojourning. He
	was informed that the abbot was then at one of his places distant
	perhaps six miles; which Primasso concluded he could reach in time
	for breakfast, if he started early in the morning. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01070014"/>When he had
	learned the way, he found that no one else was travelling by it, and
	fearing lest by mischance he should lose it, and so find himself where
	it would not be easy for him to get food, he determined to obviate so
	disagreeable a contingency by taking with him three loaves of bread--as
	for drink, water, though not much to his taste, was, he supposed,
	to be found everywhere. So, having disposed the loaves in the fold of
	his tunic, he took the road and made such progress that he reached
	the abbot's place of sojourn before the breakfast-hour. 
	<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01070015"/>Having
	entered, he made the circuit of the entire place, observing everything,
	the vast array of tables, and the vast kitchen well-appointed with all
	things needful for the preparation and service of the breakfast, and
	saying to himself: <q type="internalmonologue" who="primasso">In very truth this
	  man is even such a magnifico
	  as he is reported to be.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01070016"/>While his attention was thus occupied,
	the abbot's seneschal, it being now breakfast-time, gave order to serve
	water for the hands, which being washen, they sat them all down to
	breakfast. Now it so happened that Primasso was placed immediately
	in front of the door by which the abbot must pass from his chamber
	into the hall; 
	<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01070017"/>in which, according to rule of his court, neither wine,
	nor bread, nor aught else drinkable or eatable was ever set on the
	tables before he made his appearance and was seated. The seneschal,
	therefore, having set the tables, sent word to the abbot, that all
	was now ready, and they waited only his pleasure. 
	<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01070018"/>So the abbot
	<pb n="54"/>gave the word, the door of his chamber was thrown open, and he
	took a step or two forward towards the hall, gazing straight in front
	of him as he went. Thus it fell out that the first man on whom he
	set eyes was Primasso, who was in very sorry trim. The abbot, who
	knew him not by sight, no sooner saw him, than, surprised by a
	churlish mood to which he had hitherto been an entire stranger, he
	said to himself: 
	<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01070019"/><q type="internalmonologue" who="abatecligni">So it is
	  to such as this man that I give my hospitality;</q>
	and going back into the chamber he bade lock the door, and
	asked of his attendants whether the vile fellow that sate at table
	directly opposite the door was known to any of them, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01070020"/>who, one and all,
	answered in the negative. Primasso waited a little, but he was not
	used to fast, and his journey had whetted his appetite. So, as the abbot
	did not return, he drew out one of the loaves which he had brought
	with him, and began to eat. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01070021"/>The abbot, after a while, bade one of
	his servants go see whether Primasso were gone. The servant
	returned with the answer: <q>No, sir, and (what is more) he is
	  eating a loaf of bread, which he seems to have brought with him.</q><q who="abatecligni">Be it so then,</q> said the abbot, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01070022"/>who was
	vexed that he was not gone
	of his own accord, but was not disposed to turn him out; <q>let him
	  eat his own bread, if he have any, for he shall have none of ours today.</q>
	By and by Primasso, having finished his first loaf, began, as
	the abbot did not make his appearance, to eat the second; which was
	likewise reported to the abbot, who had again sent to see if he were
	gone. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01070023"/>Finally, as the abbot still delayed his coming, Primasso,
	having finished the second loaf, began upon the third; whereof, once
	more, word was carried to the abbot, who now began to commune
	with himself and say: <q who="abatecligni">Alas! my soul, what unwonted mood
	  harbourest thou to-day? What avarice? what scorn? and of whom?
	  I have given my hospitality, now for many a year, to whoso craved
	  it, without looking to see whether he were gentle or churl, poor or
	  rich, merchant or cheat, and mine eyes have seen it squandered on
	  vile fellows without number; and nought of that which I feel
	  towards this man ever entered my mind. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01070024"/>Assuredly it cannot be that
	  he is a man of no consequence, who is the occasion of this access of
	  avarice in me. Though he seem to me a vile fellow, he must be some
	  great man, that my mind is thus obstinately averse to do him honour.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01070025"/>Of which musings the upshot was that he sent to inquire who the
	vile fellow was, and learning that he was Primasso, come to see if what
	<pb n="55"/>he had heard of his magnificent state were true, he was stricken with
	shame, having heard of old Primasso's fame, and knowing him to be
	a great man. Wherefore, being zealous to make him the amend, he
	studied to do him honour in many ways; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01070026"/>and after breakfast, that
	his garb might accord with his native dignity, he caused him to be
	nobly arrayed, and setting him upon a palfrey and filling his purse,
	left it to his own choice, whether to go or to stay. So Primasso, with
	a full heart, thanked him for his courtesy in terms the amplest that
	he could command, and, having left <placeName>Paris</placeName> afoot, returned thither on
	horseback.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01070027"/>Messer Cane was shrewd enough to apprehend <persName>Bergamino</persName>'s
	meaning perfectly well without a gloss, and said with a smile:
	<q><persName>Bergamino</persName>, thy parable is apt, and declares to me very plainly
	  thy losses, my avarice, and what thou desirest of me. And in good
	  sooth this access of avarice, of which thou art the occasion, is the
	  first that I have experienced. But I will expel the intruder with
	  the <!--(i)-->bâton<!--(/i)--> which thou thyself hast furnished.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01070028"/>So he paid <persName>Bergamino</persName>'s
	reckoning, habited him nobly in one of his own robes, gave

	whether to go or to stay.</p></div><pb n="56"/><!--****************************************Novella 8*****************************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0108"><head>Novel VIII</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01080001"/>Guglielmo Borsiere by a neat retort sharply censures

 be the less appreciated by you, because it has a happy termination.</p></body></floatingText><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01080004"/>Know then that in <placeName>Genoa</placeName> there dwelt long ago a gentleman,
 who was known as Messer Ermino de' Grimaldi, and whose wealth,
 both in lands and money, was generally supposed to be far in excess
 of that of any other burgher then in <placeName>Italy</placeName>; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01080005"/>and as in wealth he was
 without a rival in <placeName>Italy</placeName>, so in meanness and avarice there was not
 any in the entire world, however richly endowed with those qualities,
 whom he did not immeasurably surpass, insomuch that, not only
 did he keep a tight grip upon his purse when honour was to be done
 to another, but in his personal expenditure, even upon things meet
 and proper, contrary to the general custom of the Genoese, whose
 wont is to array themselves nobly, he was extremely penurious, as
 also in his outlay upon his table. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01080006"/>Wherefore, not without just cause,
 folk had dropped his surname de' Grimaldi, and called him instead
 Messer Ermino Avarizia. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01080007"/>While thus by thrift his wealth waxed
 greater and greater, it so chanced that there came to <placeName>Genoa</placeName> a jester
 of good parts, a man debonair and ready of speech, his name
 Guglielmo Borsiere, whose like is not to be found to-day, when
 <pb n="57"/>jesters (to the great reproach be it spoken of those that claim the
 name and reputation of gentlemen) are rather to be called asses,
 being without courtly breeding, and formed after the coarse pattern
 of the basest of churls. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01080008"/>And whereas in the days of which I speak
 they made it their business, they spared no pains, to compose quarrels,
 to allay heart-burnings, between gentlemen, or arrange marriages, or
 leagues of amity, ministering meanwhile relief to jaded minds and
 solace to courts by the sprightly sallies of their wit, and with keen
 sarcasm, like fathers, censuring churlish manners, being also satisfied
 with very trifling guerdons; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01080009"/>nowadays all their care is to spend their
 time in scandal-mongering, in sowing discord, in saying, and (what
 is worse) in doing in the presence of company things churlish and
 flagitious, in bringing accusations, true or false, of wicked, shameful
 or flagitious conduct against one another; and in drawing gentlemen
 into base and nefarious practices by sinister and insidious arts. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01080010"/>And
 by these wretched and depraved lords he is held most dear and best
 rewarded whose words and deeds are the most atrocious, to the
 great reproach and scandal of the world of to-day; whereby it is
 abundantly manifest that virtue has departed from the earth, leaving
 a degenerate generation to wallow in the lowest depths of vice.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01080011"/>But reverting to the point at which I started, wherefrom under
 stress of just indignation I have deviated somewhat further than I
 intended, I say that the said Guglielmo was had in honour, and was
 well received by all the gentlemen of <placeName>Genoa</placeName>; and tarrying some
 days in the city, heard much of the meanness and avarice of Messer
 Ermino, and was curious to see him. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01080012"/>Now Messer Ermino had
 heard that this Guglielmo Borsiere was a man of good parts, and,
 notwithstanding his avarice, having in him some sparks of good
 breeding, received him with words of hearty greeting and a gladsome
 mien, and conversed freely with him and of divers matters, and so
 conversing, took him with other Genoese that were of his company
 to a new and very beautiful house which he had built, 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01080013"/>and after
 shewing him over the whole of it, said to him: <q>Now, Messer
 Guglielmo, you have seen and heard many things; could you suggest
 to me something, the like of which has not hitherto been seen,
 which I might have painted here in the saloon of this house?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01080014"/>To
 which ill-judged question Guglielmo replied: <q>Sir, it would not, I
 think, be in my power to suggest anything the like of which has
 <pb n="58"/>never been seen, unless it were a sneeze or something similar; but
 if it so please you, I have something to suggest, which, I think, you
 have never seen.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01080015"/><q>Prithee, what may that be?</q> said Messer
 Ermino, not expecting to get the answer which he got. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01080016"/>For
 Guglielmo replied forthwith: <q>Paint Courtesy here;</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01080017"/>which Messer
 Ermino had no sooner heard, than he was so stricken with shame
 that his disposition underwent a complete change, and he said:
 <q>Messer Guglielmo, I will see to it that Courtesy is here painted
 in such wise that neither you nor any one else shall ever again have
 reason to tell me that I have not seen or known that virtue.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01080018"/>And
 henceforward (so enduring was the change wrought by Guglielmo's
 words) there was not in <placeName>Genoa</placeName>, while he lived, any gentleman so

 temper that, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01100010"/>being now nigh upon seventy years of age, and all but
 devoid of natural heat of body, he was yet receptive of the flames of
 love; and having at an assembly seen a very beautiful widow lady,
 Madonna Malgherida de' Ghisolieri, as some say, and being charmed
 with her beyond measure, was, notwithstanding his age, no less
 ardently enamoured than a young man, insomuch that he was not
 well able to sleep at night, unless during the day he had seen the fair

 and could not in men be either harboured or engendered. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01100013"/>Master Alberto thus continuing to haunt the front of the house, it so
 happened that one feast-day the lady with other ladies was seated

 him and shew him honour, and then to rally him on his love; 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01100014"/>and so they did, rising with one accord to receive him, bidding him
 welcome, and ushering him into a cool courtyard, where they regaled

 <q>Madam, my love for you need surprise none that is conversant

<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01100016"/>And though old men, of course, have lost the strength which love demands
 for its full fruition, yet are they not therefore without the

 they have more experience. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01100017"/>My hope in thus old aspiring to love
 you, who are loved by so many young men, is founded on what I
 have frequently observed of ladies' ways at lunch, when they trifle
 with the lupin and the leek. In the leek no part is good, but the
 head is at any rate not so bad as the rest, and indeed not unpalatable;
 you, however, for the most part, following a depraved taste, hold it in
 your hand and munch the leaves, which are not only of no account
 but actually distasteful. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01100018"/>How am I to know, madam, that in your

 should be the man of your choice, and the rest would be cast aside.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01100019"/>Whereto the gentle lady, somewhat shame-stricken, as were also her
 fair friends, thus made answer: <q>Master Alberto, our presumption
 has received from you a most just and no less courteous reproof; but
 your love is dear to me, as should ever be that of a wise and worthy
 man. And therefore, saving my honour, I am yours, entirely and
 devotedly at your pleasure and command.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01100020"/>This speech brought
 Master Alberto to his feet, and the others also rising, he thanked the
 lady for her courtesy, bade her a gay and smiling adieu, and so

      and soon recovered her composure. She then began by confirming
      all the appointments made by <persName>Pampinea</persName>, and making all needful
      arrangements for the following morning and evening, which they
      were to pass where they then were. Whereupon she thus spoke:
      <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01970006"/><q>Dearest gossips, though, thanks rather to <persName>Pampinea</persName>'s courtesy than
	to merit of mine, I am made queen of you all; yet I am not on
	that account minded to have respect merely to my own judgment in
	the governance of our life, but to unite your wisdom with mine; and
	that you may understand what I think of doing, and by consequence
	may be able to amplify or curtail it at your pleasure, I will in few
	words make known to you my purpose. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01970007"/>The course observed by
	<persName>Pampinea</persName> to-day, if I have judged aright, seems to be alike commendable
	and delectable; wherefore, until by lapse of time, or for some
	other cause, it grow tedious, I purpose not to alter it. 
	<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01970008"/>So when we
	have arranged for what we have already taken in hand, we will go
	hence and enjoy a short walk; at sundown we will sup in the cool;
	and we will then sing a few songs and otherwise divert ourselves,
	until it is time to go to sleep. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01970009"/>To-morrow we will rise in the cool
	of the morning, and after enjoying another walk, each at his or her
	sweet will, we will return, as to-day, and in due time break our fast,
	dance, sleep, and having risen, will here resume our story-telling,
	<pb n="65"/>wherein, methinks, pleasure and profit unite in superabundant
	measure. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01970010"/>True it is that <persName>Pampinea</persName>, by reason of her late election to
	the sovereignty, neglected one matter, which I mean to introduce,
	to wit, the circumscription of the topic of our story-telling, and its
	preassignment, that each may be able to premeditate some apt story
	bearing upon the theme; and seeing that from the beginning of the
	world Fortune has made men the sport of divers accidents, and so it
	will continue until the end, the theme, so please you, shall in each
	case be the same;

      laid down, and agreed to follow it. <persName>Dioneo</persName>, however, when the rest
      had done speaking, said: <q>Madam, as all the rest have said, so say
	I, briefly, that the rule prescribed by you is commendable and delectable;
	but of your especial grace I crave a favour, which, I trust,
	may be granted and continued to me, so long as our company shall
	endure; which favour is this: that I be not bound by the assigned
	theme if I am not so minded, but that I have leave to choose such
	topic as best shall please me. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01970013"/>And lest any suppose that I crave this
	grace as one that has not stories ready to hand, I am henceforth
	content that mine be always the last.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01970014"/>The queen, knowing him to
      be a merry and facetious fellow, and feeling sure that he only craved
      this favour in order that, if the company were jaded, he might have
      an opportunity to recreate them by some amusing story, gladly, with
      the consent of the rest, granted his petition. 
      <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01970015"/>She then rose, and
      attended by the rest sauntered towards a stream, which, issuing clear
      as crystal from a neighbouring hill, precipitated itself into a valley
      shaded by trees close set amid living rock and fresh green herbage.
      Bare of foot and arm they entered the stream, and roving hither and
      thither amused themselves in divers ways till <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p01970016"/>in due time they returned
      to the palace, and gaily supped. Supper ended, the queen sent for
      instruments of music, and bade <persName>Lauretta</persName> lead a dance, while <persName>Emilia</persName>

 and very felicitous issue.</p></body></floatingText><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02010003"/>Not long ago there was at <placeName>Treviso</placeName> a German, named Arrigo, a
 poor man who got his living as a common hired porter, but, though
 of so humble a condition, was respected by all, being accounted not
      only an honest but a most holy man; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02010004"/>insomuch that, whether truly
 or falsely I know not, the Trevisans affirm, that on his decease all
 the bells of the cathedral of <placeName>Treviso</placeName> began to toll of their own accord.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02010005"/>Which being accounted a miracle, this Arrigo was generally reputed
 a saint; and all the people of the city gathered before the house where
 his body lay, and bore it, with a saint's honours, into the cathedral,
 and brought thither the halt and paralytic and blind, and others
 afflicted with disease or bodily defects, as hoping that by contact with
 this holy body they would all be healed. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02010006"/>The people thus tumultuously
 thronging the church, it so chanced that there arrived in
 <placeName>Treviso</placeName> three of our own citizens, of whom one was named Stecchi,
 another <persName>Martellino</persName>, and the third <persName>Marchese</persName>; all three being men
 <pb n="69"/>whose habit it was to frequent the courts of the nobles and afford
 spectators amusement by assuming disguises and personating other
 men. Being entire strangers to the place, and seeing everybody
 running to and fro, they were much astonished, and having learned
 the why and wherefore, were curious to go see what was to be seen.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02010007"/>So at the inn, where they put up, <persName>Marchese</persName> began: <q>We would
 fain go see this saint; but for my part I know not how we are to
 reach the spot, for I hear the piazza is full of Germans and other
 armed men, posted there by the Lord who rules here to prevent an
 uproar, and moreover the church, so far as one may learn, is so full
 of folk that scarce another soul may enter it.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02010008"/>Whereupon <persName>Martellino</persName>,
 who was bent on seeing what was to be seen, said: <q>Let not
 this deter us; I will assuredly find a way of getting to the saint's
 body.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02010009"/><q>How?</q> rejoined <persName>Marchese</persName>. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02010010"/><q>I will tell you,</q> replied <persName>Martellino</persName>;
 <q>I will counterfeit a paralytic, and thou wilt support me on one side
 and Stecchi on the other, as if I were not able to go alone, and so
 you will enter the church, making it appear as if you were leading
 me up to the body of the saint that he may heal me, and all that see
 will make way and give us free passage.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02010011"/><persName>Marchese</persName> and Stecchi
 approved the plan; so all three forthwith left the inn and repaired to
 a lonely place, where <persName>Martellino</persName> distorted his hands, his fingers, his
 arms, his legs, and also his mouth and eyes and his entire face in a
 manner horrible to contemplate; so that no stranger that saw him
 could have doubted that he was impotent and paralysed in every part
 of his body. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02010012"/>In this guise <persName>Marchese</persName> and Stecchi laid hold of him,
 and led him towards the church, assuming a most piteous air, and
 humbly beseeching everybody for God's sake to make way for them.
 Their request was readily granted; and, in short, observed by all,
 and crying out at almost every step, <q>make way, make way,</q> they
 reached the place where St. Arrigo's body was laid. Whereupon
 some gentlemen who stood by hoisted <persName>Martellino</persName> on to the saint's
 body, that thereby he might receive the boon of health. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02010013"/>There he
 lay still for a while, the eyes of all in the church being riveted upon
 him in expectation of the result; then, being a very practised performer,
 he stretched, first, one of his fingers, next a hand, afterwards
 an arm, and so forth, making as if he gradually recovered the use of
 all his natural powers. Which the people observing raised such a
 clamour in honour of St. Arrigo that even thunder would have been
 <pb n="70"/>inaudible.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02010014"/>Now it chanced that hard by stood a Florentine, who
 knew <persName>Martellino</persName> well, though he had failed to recognise him, when,
 in such strange guise, he was led into the church; but now, seeing
 him resume his natural shape, the Florentine recognised him, and at
 once said with a laugh: <q>God's curse upon him. Who that saw
 him come but would have believed that he was really paralysed?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02010015"/>These words were overheard by some of the Trevisans, who began
 forthwith to question the Florentine. <q>How?</q> said they; <q>was
 he then not paralysed?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02010016"/><q>No, by God!</q> returned the Florentine;
 <q>he has always been as straight as any of us; he has merely
 shewn you that he knows better than any man alive how to play
 this trick of putting on any counterfeit semblance that he chooses.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02010017"/>Thereupon the Trevisans, without further parley, made a rush, clearing
 the way and crying out as they went: <q>Seize this traitor who
 mocks at God and His saints; who, being no paralytic, has come
 hither in the guise of a paralytic to deride our patron saint and us.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02010018"/>So saying, they laid hands on him, dragged him down from where
 he stood, seized him by the hair, tore the clothes from his back, and
 fell to beating and kicking him, so that it seemed to him as if all the
 world were upon him. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02010019"/>He cried out: <q>Pity, for God's sake,</q> and
 defended himself as best he could: all in vain, however; the press
 became thicker and thicker moment by moment. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02010020"/>Which Stecchi and
 <persName>Marchese</persName> observing began to say one to the other that 'twas a bad
 business; yet, being apprehensive on their own account, they did not
 venture to come to his assistance, but cried out with the rest that he
 ought to die, at the same time, however, casting about how they
 might find the means to rescue him from the hands of the people,
 who would certainly have killed him, but for a diversion which
 <persName>Marchese</persName> hastily effected. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02010021"/>The entire posse of the signory being just
 outside, he ran off at full speed to the Podestà's lieutenant, and
 said
 to him: <q>Help, for God's sake; there is a villain here that has cut
 my purse with full a hundred florins of gold in it; prithee have him
 arrested that I may have my own again.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02010022"/>Whereupon, twelve
 sergeants or more ran forthwith to the place where hapless <persName>Martellino</persName>
 was being carded without a comb, and, forcing their way with the
 utmost difficulty through the throng, rescued him all bruised and
 battered from their hands, and led him to the palace; whither he was
 followed by many who, resenting what he had done, and hearing that
 <pb n="71"/>he was arrested as a cutpurse, and lacking better pretext for harassing
 him, began one and all to charge him with having cut their purses.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02010023"/>All which the deputy of the Podestà had no sooner heard, than, being
 a harsh man, he straightway took <persName>Martellino</persName> aside and began to
 examine him. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02010024"/><persName>Martellino</persName> answered his questions in a bantering tone,
 making light of the arrest; whereat the deputy, losing patience, had
 him bound to the strappado, and caused him to receive a few hints of
 the cord with intent to extort from him a confession of his guilt, by
 way of preliminary to hanging him. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02010025"/>Taken down from the strappado,
 and questioned by the deputy if what his accusers said were
 true, <persName>Martellino</persName>, as nothing was to be gained by denial, answered:
 <q>My lord, I am ready to confess the truth; let but my accusers say,
 each of them, when and where I cut his purse, and I will tell you
 what I have and what I have not done.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02010026"/><q>So be it,</q> said the deputy,
 and caused a few of them to be summoned. Whereupon <persName>Martellino</persName>,
 being charged with having cut this, that or the other man's purse
 eight, six or four days ago, while others averred that he had cut their
 purses that very day, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02010027"/>answered thus: <q>My lord, these men lie in
 the throat, and for token that I speak true, I tell you that, so far from
 having been here as long as they make out, it is but very lately that
 I came into these parts, where I never was before; and no sooner was
 I come, than, as my ill-luck would have it, I went to see the body of
 this saint, and so have been carded as you see; and that what I say
 is true, his Lordship's intendant of arrivals, and his book, and also my
 host may certify. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02010028"/>Wherefore, if you find that even so it is as I say,
 hearken not to these wicked men, and spare me the torture and death
 which they would have you inflict.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02010029"/>In this posture of affairs
 <persName>Marchese</persName> and Stecchi, learning that the Podestà's deputy was dealing
 rigorously with <persName>Martellino</persName>, and had already put him to the strappado,
 grew mightily alarmed. <q>We have made a mess of it,</q> they said to
 themselves; <q>we have only taken him out of the frying-pan to toss
 him into the fire.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02010030"/>So, hurrying hither and thither with the utmost
 zeal, they made diligent search until they found their host, and told
 him how matters stood. The host had his laugh over the affair, and
 then brought them to one Sandro <persName>Agolanti</persName>, who dwelt in <placeName>Treviso</placeName>
 and had great interest with the Lord of the place. The host laid the
 whole matter before Sandro, and, backed by <persName>Marchese</persName> and Stecchi,
 besought him to undertake <persName>Martellino</persName>'s cause. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02010031"/>Sandro, after many
 <pb n="72"/>a hearty laugh, hied him to the Lord, who at his instance sent for
 <persName>Martellino</persName>. The messengers found <persName>Martellino</persName> still in his shirt before
 the deputy, at his wits' end, and all but beside himself with fear,
 because the deputy would hear nothing that he said in his defence.
 Indeed, the deputy, having a spite against Florentines, had quite
 made up his mind to have him hanged; he was therefore in the last
 degree reluctant to surrender him to the Lord, and only did so upon
 compulsion. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02010032"/>Brought at length before the Lord, <persName>Martellino</persName> detailed
 to him the whole affair, and prayed him as the greatest of favours to
 let him depart in peace. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02010033"/>The Lord had a hearty laugh over the
 adventure, and bestowed a tunic on each of the three. So, congratulating
 themselves on their unexpected deliverance from so great
 a peril, they returned home safe and sound.</p></div><pb n="73"/><!--*******************************Novella 2****************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0202"><head>Novel II</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02020001"/><!--(i)-->Rinaldo d'Asti is robbed, arrives at <placeName>Castel Guglielmo</placeName>,

 merchant, Rinaldo d'Asti by name, having disposed of certain affairs
 which had brought him to <placeName>Bologna</placeName>, set his face homeward, and
 having left <placeName>Ferrara</placeName> behind him was on his way to <placeName>Verona</placeName>, when he
 fell in with some men that looked like merchants, but were in truth
 robbers and men of evil life and condition, whose company he
      imprudently joined, riding and conversing with them. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02020005"/>They, perceiving
 that he was a merchant, and judging that he must have
 money about him, complotted to rob him on the first opportunity;
 and to obviate suspicion they played the part of worthy and reputable
 men, their discourse of nought but what was seemly and honourable
 and leal, their demeanour at once as respectful and as cordial as they
 could make it; so that he deemed himself very lucky to have met
 with them, being otherwise alone save for a single mounted servant.
 <pb n="74"/><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02020006"/>Journeying
 thus, they conversed, after the desultory manner of travellers,
 of divers matters, until at last they fell a talking of the prayers which
 men address to God, and one of the robbers--there were three of
 them--said to Rinaldo: <q>And you, gentle sir, what is your wonted
 orison when you are on your travels?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02020007"/>Rinaldo answered: <q>Why,
 to tell the truth, I am a man unskilled, unlearned in such matters,
 and few prayers have I at my command, being one that lives in the
 good old way and lets two soldi count for twenty-four deniers;
 nevertheless it has always been my custom in journeying to say of a
 morning, as I leave the inn, a paternoster and an avemaria for the
 souls of the father and mother of St. Julian, after which I pray God
 and St. Julian to provide me with a good inn for the night. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02020008"/>And
 many a time in the course of my life have I met with great perils by
 the way, and evading them all have found comfortable quarters for
 the night: whereby my faith is assured, that St. Julian, in whose
 honour I say my paternoster, has gotten me this favour of God; nor
 should I look for a prosperous journey and a safe arrival at night, if
 I had not said it in the morning.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02020009"/>Then said his interrogator:
 <q>And did you say it this morning?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02020010"/>Whereto Rinaldo answered, <q>Troth, did I,</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02020011"/>which caused the other, who by this time knew
 what course matters would take, to say to himself: <q>'Twill prove
 to have been said in the nick of time; for if we do not miscarry, I
 take it thou wilt have but a sorry lodging.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02020012"/>Then turning to
 Rinaldo he said: <q>I also have travelled much, and never a prayer
 have I said, though I have heard them much commended by many;
 nor has it ever been my lot to find other than good quarters for the
 night; it may be that this very evening you will be able to determine
 which of us has the better lodging, you that have said the paternoster,
 or I that have not said it. True, however, it is that in its stead I
 am accustomed to say the 'Dirupisti,' or the 'Intemerata,' or the
 'De profundis,' which, if what my grandmother used to say is to be
 believed, are of the greatest efficacy.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02020013"/>So, talking of divers matters,
 and ever on the look-out for time and place suited to their evil
 purpose, they continued their journey, until towards evening, some
 distance from <placeName>Castel Guglielmo</placeName>, as they were about to ford a stream,
 these three ruffians, profiting by the lateness of the hour, and the
 loneliness and straitness of the place, set upon Rinaldo and robbed
 him, and leaving him afoot and in his shirt, said by way of adieu:
 <pb n="75"/><q>Go now, and see if thy St. Julian will provide thee with good
 lodging to-night; our saint, we doubt not, will do as much by us;</q>
 and so crossing the stream, they went their way. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02020014"/>Rinaldo's servant,
 coward that he was, did nothing to help his master when he saw him
 attacked, but turned his horse's head, and was off at a smart pace;
 nor did he draw rein until he was come to <placeName>Castel Guglielmo</placeName>; where,
 it being now evening, he put up at an inn and gave himself no
 further trouble. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02020015"/>Rinaldo, left barefoot, and stripped to his shirt,
 while the night closed in very cold and snowy, was at his wits' end,
 and shivering so that his teeth chattered in his head, began to peer
 about, if haply he might find some shelter for the night, that so
 he might not perish with the cold; but, seeing none (for during a
 recent war the whole country had been wasted by fire), he set off for
 <placeName>Castel Guglielmo</placeName>, quickening his pace by reason of the cold.
 Whether his servant had taken refuge in <placeName>Castel Guglielmo</placeName> or
 elsewhere, he knew not, but he thought that, could he but enter
 the town, God would surely send him some succour. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02020016"/>However,
 dark night overtook him while he was still about a mile from the
 castle; so that on his arrival he found the gates already locked and
 the bridges raised, and he could not pass in. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02020017"/>Sick at heart, disconsolate
 and bewailing his evil fortune, he looked about for some
 place where he might ensconce himself, and at any rate find shelter
 from the snow. And by good luck he espied a house, built with a
 balcony a little above the castle-wall, under which balcony he
 purposed to shelter himself until daybreak. Arrived at the spot, he
 found beneath the balcony a postern, which, however, was locked;
 and having gathered some bits of straw that lay about, he placed
 them in front of the postern, and there in sad and sorrowful plight
 took up his quarters, with many a piteous appeal to St. Julian, whom
 he reproached for not better rewarding the faith which he reposed
 in him. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02020018"/>St. Julian, however, had not abandoned him, and in due
 time provided him with a good lodging.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02020019"/>There was in the castle a widow lady of extraordinary beauty
 (none fairer) whom Marquis Azzo loved as his own life, and kept
 there for his pleasure. She lived in the very same house beneath
 the balcony of which Rinaldo had posted himself. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02020020"/>Now it chanced
 that that very day the Marquis had come to <placeName>Castel Guglielmo</placeName> to
 pass the night with her, and had privily caused a bath to be made
 <pb n="76"/>ready, and a supper suited to his rank, in the lady's own house.
 The arrangements were complete; and only the Marquis was stayed
 for, when a servant happened to present himself at the castle-gate,
 bringing tidings for the Marquis which obliged him suddenly to take
 horse. He therefore sent word to the lady that she must not wait
 for him, and forthwith took his departure. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02020021"/>The lady, somewhat
 disconsolate, found nothing better to do than to get into the bath
 which had been intended for the Marquis, sup and go to bed: so
 into the bath she went. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02020022"/>The bath was close to the postern on the
 other side of which hapless Rinaldo had ensconced himself, and thus
 the mournful and quavering music which Rinaldo made as he
 shuddered in the cold, and which seemed rather to proceed from a
 stork's beak than from the mouth of a human being, was audible to
 the lady in the bath. She therefore called her maid, and said to
 her: <q>Go up and look out over the wall and down at the postern,
 and mark who is there, and what he is, and what he does there.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02020023"/>The maid obeyed, and, the night being fine, had no difficulty in
 making out Rinaldo as he sate there, barefoot, as I have said, and in
 his shirt, and trembling in every limb. So she called out to him,
 to know who he was. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02020024"/>Rinaldo, who could scarcely articulate for
 shivering, told as briefly as he could, who he was, and how and why
 he came to be there; which done, he began piteously to beseech
 her not, if she could avoid it, to leave him there all night to perish of
 cold. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02020025"/>The maid went back to her mistress full of pity for Rinaldo,
 and told her all she had seen and heard. The lady felt no less pity
 for Rinaldo; and bethinking her that she had the key of the postern
 by which the Marquis sometimes entered when he paid her a secret
 visit, she said to the maid: <q>Go, and let him in softly; here is
 this supper, and there will be none to eat it; and we can very well
 put him up for the night.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02020026"/>Cordially commending her mistress's
 humanity, the maid went and let Rinaldo in, and brought him to the
 lady, who, seeing that he was all but dead with cold, said to him:
 <q>Quick, good man, get into that bath, which is still warm.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02020027"/>Gladly he did so, awaiting no second invitation, and was so much
 comforted by its warmth that he seemed to have passed from death
 to life. The lady provided him with a suit of clothes, which
 had been worn by her husband shortly before his death, and which,
 when he had them on, looked as if they had been made for him. So
 <pb n="77"/>he recovered heart, and, while he awaited the lady's commands, gave
 thanks to God and St. Julian for delivering him from a woful night
 and conducting him, as it seemed, to comfortable quarters.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02020028"/>The lady meanwhile took a little rest, after which she had a
 roaring fire put in one of her large rooms, whither presently she
 came, and asked her maid how the good man did. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02020029"/>The maid
 replied: <q>Madam, he has put on the clothes, in which he shews
 to advantage, having a handsome person, and seeming to be a worthy
 man, and well-bred.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02020030"/><q>Go, call him then,</q> said the lady, <q>tell him
 to come hither to the fire, and we will sup; for I know that he has
 not supped.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02020031"/>Rinaldo, on entering the room and seeing the lady,
 took her to be of no small consequence. He therefore made her a
 low bow, and did his utmost to thank her worthily for the service
 she had rendered him. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02020032"/>His words pleased her no less than his
 person, which accorded with what the maid had said: so she made
 him heartily welcome, installed him at his ease by her side before the
 fire, and questioned him of the adventure which had brought him
 thither. Rinaldo detailed all the circumstances, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02020033"/>of which the lady
 had heard somewhat when Rinaldo's servant made his appearance at
 the castle. She therefore gave entire credence to what he said, and
 told him what she knew about his servant, and how he might easily
 find him on the morrow. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02020034"/>She then bade set the table, which done,
 Rinaldo and she washed their hands and sate down together to sup.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02020035"/>Tall he was and comely of form and feature, debonair and gracious
 of mien and manner, and in his lusty prime. The lady had eyed
 him again and again to her no small satisfaction, and, her wantonness
 being already kindled for the Marquis, who was to have come
 to lie with her, she had let Rinaldo take the vacant place in her
 mind. So when supper was done, and they were risen from the
 table, she conferred with her maid, whether, after the cruel trick
 played upon her by the Marquis, it were not well to take the good
 gift which Fortune had sent her. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02020036"/>The maid knowing the bent of
 her mistress's desire, left no word unsaid that might encourage her
 to follow it. Wherefore the lady, turning towards Rinaldo, who
 was standing where she had left him by the fire, began thus: 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02020037"/><q>So!
 Rinaldo, why still so pensive? Will nothing console you for the
 loss of a horse and a few clothes? Take heart, put a blithe face on
 it, you are at home; nay more, let me tell you that, seeing you in
 <pb n="78"/>those clothes which my late husband used to wear, and taking you
 for him, I have felt, not once or twice, but perhaps a hundred times
 this evening, a longing to throw my arms round you and kiss you;
 and, in faith, I had so done, but that I feared it might displease you.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02020038"/>Rinaldo, hearing these words, and marking the flame which shot
 from the lady's eyes, and being no laggard, came forward with open
 arms, and confronted her and said: <q>Madam, I am not unmindful
 that I must ever acknowledge that to you I owe my life, in regard
 of the peril whence you rescued me. If then there be any way in
 which I may pleasure you, churlish indeed were I not to devise it.
 So you may even embrace and kiss me to your heart's content, and
 I will embrace and kiss you with the best of good wills.</q> There
 needed no further parley. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02020039"/>The lady, all aflame with amorous desire,
 forthwith threw herself into his arms, and straining him to her
 bosom with a thousand passionate embraces, gave and received a
 thousand kisses before they sought her chamber. There with all
 speed they went to bed, nor did day surprise them until again and
 again and in full measure they had satisfied their desire. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02020040"/>With the
 first streaks of dawn they rose, for the lady was minded that none
 should surmise aught of the affair. So, having meanly habited
 Rinaldo, and replenished his purse, she enjoined him to keep the
 secret, shewed him the way to the castle, where he was to find his
 servant, and let him out by the same postern by which he had
 entered. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02020041"/>When it was broad day the gates were opened, and
 Rinaldo, passing himself off as a traveller from distant parts, entered
 the castle, and found his servant. Having put on the spare suit
 which was in his valise, he was about to mount the servant's horse,
 when, as if by miracle, there were brought into the castle the three
 gentlemen of the road who had robbed him the evening before,
 having been taken a little while after for another offence. Upon
 their confession Rinaldo's horse was restored to him, as were also his
 clothes and money; so that he lost nothing except a pair of garters,
 of which the robbers knew not where they had bestowed them.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02020042"/>Wherefore Rinaldo, giving thanks to God and St. Julian, mounted
 his horse, and returned home safe and sound, and on the morrow the
 three robbers kicked heels in the wind.</p></div><pb n="79"/><!--*******************************Novella 3****************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0203"><head>Novel III</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02030001"/><!--(i)-->Three young men squander their substance and are

 Tedaldo, of the <persName>Lamberti</persName>, according to some, or, as others say, of the
 <pb n="80"/><persName>Agolanti</persName>
 family, perhaps for no better reason than that the occupation
 of his sons was similar to that which always was and is the
      occupation of the <persName>Agolanti</persName>. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02030007"/>However, without professing to
 determine which of the two houses he belonged to, I say, that he
 was in his day a very wealthy knight, and had three sons, the eldest
 being by name Lamberto, the second Tedaldo, and the third
 Agolante. Fine, spirited young men were they all, though the
 eldest was not yet eighteen years old when their father, Messer
 Tedaldo, died very rich, leaving to them as his lawful heirs the
 whole of his property both movable and immovable. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02030008"/>Finding
 themselves thus possessed of great wealth, both in money and in
 lands and chattels, they fell to spending without stint or restraint,
 indulging their every desire, maintaining a great establishment, and
 a large and well-filled stable, besides dogs and hawks, keeping ever
 open house, scattering largesses, jousting, and, not content with these
 and the like pastimes proper to their condition, indulging every
 appetite natural to their youth. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02030009"/>They had not long followed this
 course of life before the cash left them by their father was exhausted;
 and, their rents not sufficing to defray their expenditure, they began
 to sell and pledge their property, and disposing of it by degrees, one
 item to-day and another to-morrow, they hardly perceived that they
 were approaching the verge of ruin, until poverty opened the eyes
 which wealth had fast sealed. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02030010"/>So one day Lamberto called his
 brothers to him, reminded them of the position of wealth and
 dignity which had been theirs and their father's before them, and
 shewed them the poverty to which their extravagance had reduced
 them, and adjured them most earnestly that, before their destitution
 was yet further manifest, they should all three sell what little
 remained to them and depart thence; which accordingly they did.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02030011"/>Without leave-taking, or any ceremony, they quitted <placeName>Florence</placeName>; nor
 did they rest until they had arrived in <placeName>England</placeName> and established
 themselves in a small house in <placeName>London</placeName>, where, by living with extreme
 parsimony and lending at exorbitant usances, they prospered so well
 that in the course of a few years they amassed a fortune; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02030012"/>and so,
 one by one, they returned to <placeName>Florence</placeName>, purchased not a few of their
 former estates besides many others, and married. The management
 of their affairs in <placeName>England</placeName> where they continued their business of
 usurers, they left to a young nephew, Alessandro by name, while,
 <pb n="81"/>heedless
 alike of the teaching of experience and of marital and
 parental duty, they all three launched out at <placeName>Florence</placeName> into more
 extravagant expenditure than before, and contracted debts on all
 hands and to large amounts. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02030013"/>This expenditure they were enabled
 for some years to support by the remittances made by Alessandro,
 who, to his great profit, had lent money to the barons on the
 security of their castles and rents.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02030014"/>While the three brothers thus continued to spend freely, and,
 when short of money, to borrow it, never doubting of help from
 <placeName>England</placeName>, it so happened that, to the surprise of everybody, there
 broke out in <placeName>England</placeName> a war between the King and his son, by which
 the whole island was divided into two camps; whereby Alessandro
 lost all his mortgages of the baronial castles and every other source of
 income whatsoever. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02030015"/>However, in the daily expectation that peace
 would be concluded between the King and his son, Alessandro,
 hoping that in that event all would be restored to him, principal and
 interest, tarried in the island; and the three brothers at <placeName>Florence</placeName> in
 no degree retrenched their extravagant expenditure, but went on
 borrowing from day to day. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02030016"/>Several years thus passed; and, their
 hopes being frustrated, the three brothers not only lost credit, but,
 being pressed for payment by their creditors, were suddenly arrested,
 and, their property proving deficient, were kept in prison for the
 balance, while their wives and little children went into the country
 parts, or elsewhere, wretchedly equipped, and with no other prospect
 than to pass the rest of their days in destitution. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02030017"/>Alessandro, meanwhile,
 seeing that the peace, which he had for several years awaited
 in <placeName>England</placeName>, did not come, and deeming that he would hazard his
 life to no purpose by tarrying longer in the country, made up his
 mind to return to <placeName>Italy</placeName>. He travelled at first altogether alone; but
 it so chanced that he left Bruges at the same time with an abbot,
 habited in white, attended by a numerous retinue, and preceded by
 a goodly baggage-train. Behind the abbot rode two greybeard
 knights, kinsmen of the King, in whom Alessandro recognised
 acquaintances, and, making himself known to them, was readily
 received into their company. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02030018"/>As thus they journeyed together,
 Alessandro softly asked them who the monks were that rode in front
 with so great a train, and whither they were bound. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02030019"/><q>The foremost
 rider,</q> replied one of the knights, <q>is a young kinsman of ours, the
 <pb n="82"/>newly-elected
 abbot of one of the greatest abbeys of <placeName>England</placeName>; and
 as he is not of legal age for such a dignity, we are going with him to
 <placeName>Rome</placeName> to obtain the Holy Father's dispensation and his confirmation
 in the office; but this is not a matter for common talk.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02030020"/>Now the
 new abbot, as lords are wont to do when they travel, was sometimes
 in front, sometimes in rear of his train; and thus it happened that,
 as he passed, he set eyes on Alessandro, who was still quite young,
 and very shapely and well-favoured, and as courteous, gracious and
 debonair as e'er another. The abbot was marvellously taken with
 him at first sight, having never seen aught that pleased him so much,
 called him to his side, addressed him graciously, and asked him who
 he was, whence he came, and whither he was bound. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02030021"/>Alessandro
 frankly told all about himself, and having thus answered the abbot's
 questions, placed himself at his service as far as his small ability
 might extend. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02030022"/>The abbot was struck by his easy flow of apt speech,
 and observing his bearing more closely, he made up his mind that,
 albeit his occupation was base, he was nevertheless of gentle blood,
 which added no little to his interest in him; and being moved to
 compassion by his misfortunes, he gave him friendly consolation,
 bidding him be of good hope, that if he lived a worthy life, God
 would yet set him in a place no less or even more exalted than that
 whence Fortune had cast him down, and prayed him to be of his
 company as far as <placeName>Tuscany</placeName>, as both were going the same way.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02030023"/>Alessandro thanked him for his words of comfort, and professed
 himself ready to obey his every command.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02030024"/>So fared on the abbot, his mind full of new ideas begotten by the
 sight of Alessandro, until some days later they came to a town which
 was none too well provided with inns; and, as the abbot must needs
 put up there, Alessandro, who was well acquainted with one of the
 innkeepers, arranged that the abbot should alight at his house, and
 procured him the least discomfortable quarters which it could afford.
 He thus became for the nonce the abbot's seneschal, and being very
 expert for such office, managed excellently, quartering the retinue in
 divers parts of the town. So the abbot supped, and, the night being
 far spent, all went to bed except Alessandro, who then asked the host
 where he might find quarters for the night. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02030025"/><q>In good sooth, I
 know not,</q> replied the host; <q>thou seest that every place is occupied,
 and that I and my household must lie on the benches. How<pb n="83"/>ever,
 in the abbot's chamber there are some corn-sacks. I can shew
 thee the way thither, and lay a bit of a bed upon them, and there, an
 it like thee, thou mayst pass the night very well.</q><q>How sayst
 thou?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02030026"/>said Alessandro; <q>in the abbot's chamber, which thou
 knowest is small, so that there was not room for any of the monks
 to sleep there? Had I understood this when the curtains were
 drawn, I would have quartered his monks on the corn-sacks, and
 slept myself where the monks sleep.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02030027"/><q>'Tis even so, however,</q>
 replied the host, <q>and thou canst, if thou wilt, find excellent quarters
 there: the abbot sleeps, the curtains are close drawn; I will go
 in softly and lay a small bed there, on which thou canst sleep.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02030028"/>Alessandro, satisfied that it might be managed without disturbing the
 abbot, accepted the offer, and made his arrangements for passing the
 night as quietly as he could.</p><p>The abbot was not asleep; his mind being far too overwrought
 by certain newly-awakened desires. He had heard what had passed
 between Alessandro and the host, he had marked the place where
 Alessandro had lain down, and in the great gladness of his heart had
 begun thus to commune with himself: <q>God has sent me the
 opportunity of gratifying my desire; if I let it pass, perchance it
 will be long before another such opportunity occurs.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02030029"/>So, being
 minded by no means to let it slip, when all was quiet in the inn, he
 softly called Alessandro, and bade him lie down by his side. Alessandro
 made many excuses, but ended by undressing and obeying;
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02030030"/>whereupon the abbot laid a hand on Alessandro's breast, and began to
 caress him just as amorous girls do their lovers; whereat Alessandro
 marvelled greatly, doubting the abbot was prompted to such caresses
 by a shameful love. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02030031"/>Which the abbot speedily divined, or else surmised
 from some movement on Alessandro's part, and, laughing,
 threw off a chemise which she had upon her, and taking Alessandro's
 hand, laid it on her bosom, saying: <q>Alessandro, dismiss thy foolish
 thought, feel here, and learn what I conceal.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02030032"/>Alessandro obeyed,
 laying a hand upon the abbot's bosom, where he encountered two
 little teats, round, firm and delicate, as they had been of ivory;
 whereby he at once knew that 'twas a woman, and without awaiting
 further encouragement forthwith embraced her, and would have
 kissed her, when she said: 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02030033"/><q>Before thou art more familiar with me
 hearken to what I have to say to thee. As thou mayst perceive, I
 <pb n="84"/>am no man, but a woman. Virgin I left my home, and was going
 to the Pope to obtain his sanction for my marriage, when, as Fortune
 willed, whether for thy gain or my loss, no sooner had I seen thee
 the other day, than I burned for thee with such a flame of love as
 never yet had lady for any man. Wherefore I am minded to have
 thee for my husband rather than any other; so, if thou wilt not
 have me to wife, depart at once, and return to thine own place.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02030034"/>Albeit he knew not who she was, Alessandro by the retinue which
 attended her conjectured that she must be noble and wealthy, and he
 saw that she was very fair; so it was not long before he answered
 that, if such were her pleasure, it was very much to his liking.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02030035"/>Whereupon she sate up, set a ring on his finger, and espoused him
 before a tiny picture of our Lord; after which they embraced, and
 to their no small mutual satisfaction solaced themselves for the rest
 of the night. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02030036"/>At daybreak Alessandro rose, and by preconcert with
 the lady, left the chamber as he had entered it, so that none knew
 where he had passed the night: then, blithe at heart beyond measure,
 he rejoined the abbot and his train, and so, resuming their journey,
 they after many days arrived at <placeName>Rome</placeName>. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02030037"/>They had not been there
 more than a few days, when the abbot, attended by the two knights
 and Alessandro, waited on the Pope, whom, after making the due
 obeisance, he thus addressed: <q>Holy Father, as you must know
 better than any other, whoso intends to lead a true and honourable
 life ought, as far as may be, to shun all occasion of error; for which
 cause I, having a mind to live honourably, did, the better to accomplish
 my purpose, assume the habit in which you see me, and depart
 by stealth from the court of my father, the King of <placeName>England</placeName>, who
 was minded to marry me, young as you see me to be, to the aged
 King of <placeName>Scotland</placeName>; and, carrying with me not a little of his treasure,
 set my face hitherward that your Holiness might bestow me in
 marriage. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02030038"/>Nor was it the age of the King of <placeName>Scotland</placeName> that moved
 me to flee so much as fear lest the frailty of my youth should, were I
 married to him, betray me to commit some breach of divine law, and
 sully the honour of my father's royal blood. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02030039"/>And as in this frame of
 mind I journeyed, God, who knows best what is meet for every
 one, did, as I believe, of His mercy shew me him whom He is pleased
 to appoint me for my husband, even this young man</q> (pointing to
 Alessandro) <q>whom you see by my side, who for nobility of nature
 <pb n="85"/>and bearing is a match for any great lady, though the strain of his
 blood, perhaps, be not of royal purity. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02030040"/>Him, therefore, have I
 chosen, him will I have, and no other, no matter what my father or
 any one else may think. And albeit the main purpose with which I
 started is fulfilled, yet I have thought good to continue my journey,
 that I may visit the holy and venerable places which abound in this
 city, and your Holiness, and that so in your presence, and by consequence
 in the presence of others, I may renew my marriage-vow with
 Alessandro, whereof God alone was witness. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02030041"/>Wherefore I humbly
 pray you that God's will and mine may be also yours, and that you
 pronounce your benison thereon, that therewith, having the more
 firm assurance of the favour of Him, whose vicar you are, we may
 both live together, and, when the time comes, die to God's glory
 and yours.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02030042"/>Alessandro was filled with wonder and secret delight, when he
 heard that his wife was the daughter of the King of <placeName>England</placeName>; but
 greater still was the wonder of the two knights, and such their
 wrath that, had they been anywhere else than in the Pope's presence,
 they would not have spared to affront Alessandro, and perhaps the
 lady too. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02030043"/>The Pope, on his part, found matter enough for wonder
 as well in the lady's habit as in her choice; but, knowing that he
 could not refuse, he consented to grant her request.</p><p>He therefore began by smoothing the ruffled tempers of the
 knights, and having reconciled them with the lady and Alessandro,
 proceeded to put matters in train for the marriage. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02030044"/>When the day
 appointed was come, he gave a great reception, at which were
 assembled all the cardinals and many other great lords; to whom he
 presented the lady royally robed, and looking so fair and so gracious
 that she won, as she deserved, the praise of all, and likewise Alessandro,
 splendidly arrayed, and bearing himself not a whit like the young
 usurer but rather as one of royal blood, for which cause he received
 due honour from the knights. There, before the Pope himself, the
 marriage-vows were solemnly renewed; and afterwards the marriage,
 which was accompanied by every circumstance that could add grace

 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02030045"/>Alessandro and the lady on leaving <placeName>Rome</placeName> saw fit to visit
 <placeName>Florence</placeName>, whither fame had already wafted the news, so that they
 were received by the citizens with every token of honour. The

 reinstated them and their wives in their several properties. So, leaving

 between <placeName>Reggio</placeName> and <placeName>Gaeta</placeName>; and in particular the slope which overlooks
 the sea by <placeName>Salerno</placeName>, and which the dwellers there call the Slope
 of <placeName>Amalfi</placeName>, is studded with little towns, gardens and fountains, and
 peopled by men as wealthy and enterprising in mercantile affairs as
 are anywhere to be found; in one of which towns, to wit, <placeName>Ravello</placeName>,
 rich as its inhabitants are to-day, there was formerly a merchant,
 who surpassed them all in wealth, Landolfo Ruffolo by name, who
 yet, not content with his wealth, but desiring to double it, came
      nigh to lose it all and his own life to boot. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02040006"/>Know, then, that this
 man, having made his calculations, as merchants are wont, bought a
 <pb n="88"/>great ship, which, entirely at his own expense, he loaded with divers
 sorts of merchandise, and sailed to <placeName>Cyprus</placeName>. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02040007"/>There he found several
 other ships, each laden with just such a cargo as his own, and was
 therefore fain to dispose of his goods at a very cheap rate, insomuch
 that he might almost as well have thrown them away, and was
 brought to the verge of ruin. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02040008"/>Mortified beyond measure to find
 himself thus reduced in a short space of time from opulence to something
 like poverty, he was at his wits' end, and rather than go home
 poor, having left home rich, he was minded to retrieve his losses by
 piracy or die in the attempt. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02040009"/>So he sold his great ship, and with the
 price and the proceeds of the sale of his merchandise bought a light
 bark such as corsairs use, and having excellently well equipped her
 with the armament and all things else meet for such service, took to
 scouring the seas as a rover, preying upon all folk alike, but more
 particularly upon the Turk.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02040010"/>In this enterprise he was more favoured by Fortune than in
 his trading adventures. A year had scarce gone by before he had
 taken so many ships from the Turk that not only had he recovered
 the fortune which he had lost in trade, but was well on the way
 to doubling it. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02040011"/>The bitter memory of his late losses taught him
 sobriety; he estimated his gains and found them ample; and lest
 he should have a second fall, he schooled himself to rest content
 with them, and made up his mind to return home without attempting
 to add to them. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02040012"/>Shy of adventuring once more in trade, he
 refrained from investing them in any way, but shaped his course
 for home, carrying them with him in the very same bark in which
 he had gotten them. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02040013"/>He had already entered the Archipelago when
 one evening a contrary wind sprang up from the south-east, bringing
 with it a very heavy sea, in which his bark could not well have lived.
 He therefore steered her into a bay under the lee of one of the
 islets, and there determined to await better weather. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02040014"/>As he lay
 there two great carracks of <placeName>Genoa</placeName>, homeward-bound from <placeName>Constantinople</placeName>,
 found, not without difficulty, shelter from the tempest
 in the same bay. The masters of the carracks espied the bark, and
 found out to whom she belonged: the fame of Landolfo and his
 vast wealth had already reached them, and had excited their natural
 cupidity and rapacity. They therefore determined to capture the
 bark, which lay without means of escape. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02040015"/>Part of their men, well
 <pb n="89"/>armed with cross-bows and other weapons, they accordingly sent
 ashore, so posting them that no one could leave the bark without
 being exposed to the bolts; the rest took to their boats, and rowed
 up to the side of Landolfo's little craft, which in a little time, with
 little trouble and no loss or risk, they captured with all aboard
 her. They then cleared the bark of all she contained, allowing
 Landolfo, whom they set aboard one of the carracks, only a pitiful
 doublet, and sunk her. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02040016"/>Next day the wind shifted, and the carracks
 set sail on a westerly course, which they kept prosperously enough
 throughout the day; but towards evening a tempest arose, and the
 sea became very boisterous, so that the two ships were parted one
 from the other. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02040017"/>And such was the fury of the gale that the ship,
 aboard which was poor, hapless Landolfo, was driven with prodigious
 force upon a shoal off the island of <placeName>Cephalonia</placeName>, and broke up and
 went to pieces like so much glass dashed against a wall. Wherefore
 the unfortunate wretches that were aboard her, launched amid the
 floating merchandise and chests and planks with which the sea was
 strewn, did as men commonly do in such a case; and though the night
 was of the murkiest and the sea rose and fell in mountainous surges,
 such as could swim sought to catch hold of whatever chance brought
 in their way. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02040018"/>Among whom hapless Landolfo, who only the day
 before had again and again prayed for death, rather than he should
 return home in such poverty, now, seeing death imminent, was
 afraid; and, like the rest, laid hold of the first plank that came to
 hand, in the hope that, if he could but avoid immediate drowning,
 God would in some way aid his escape. Gripping the beam with
 his legs as best he might, while wind and wave tossed him hither
 and thither, he contrived to keep himself afloat until broad day:
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02040019"/>when, looking around him, he discerned nothing but clouds and sea
 and a chest, which, borne by the wave, from time to time drew
 nigh him to his extreme terror, for he apprehended it might strike
 against the plank, and do him a mischief; and ever, as it came near
 him, he pushed it off with all the little force he had in his hand.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02040020"/>But, as it happened, a sudden gust of wind swept down upon the
 sea, and struck the chest with such force that it was driven against
 the plank on which Landolfo was, and upset it, and Landolfo went
 under the waves. Swimming with an energy begotten rather of
 fear than of strength, he rose to the surface only to see the plank
 <pb n="90"/>so far from him that, doubting he could not reach it, he made for
 the chest, which was close at hand; and resting his breast upon the
 lid, he did what he could to keep it straight with his arms. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02040021"/>In this
 manner, tossed to and fro by the sea, without tasting food, for not
 a morsel had he with him, and drinking more than he cared for,
 knowing not where he was, and seeing nothing but the sea, he
 remained all that day, and the following night. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02040022"/>The next day, as
 the will of God, or the force of the wind so ordered, more like a
 sponge than aught else, but still with both hands holding fast by
 the edges of the chest, as we see those do that clutch aught to save
 themselves from drowning, he was at length borne to the coast of
 the island of <placeName>Corfu</placeName>, where by chance a poor woman was just then
 scrubbing her kitchen-ware with sand and salt-water to make it
 shine. The woman caught sight of him as he drifted shorewards,
 but making out only a shapeless mass, was at first startled, and
 shrieked and drew back. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02040023"/>Landolfo was scarce able to see, and
 uttered no sound, for his power of speech was gone. However,
 when the sea brought him close to the shore, she distinguished the
 shape of the chest, and gazing more intently, she first made out the
 arms strained over the chest, and then discerned the face and divined
 the truth. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02040024"/>So, prompted by pity, she went out a little way into the
 sea, which was then calm, took him by the hair of the head, and
 drew him to land, chest and all. Then, not without difficulty she
 disengaged his hands from the chest, which she set on the head of
 a little girl, her daughter, that was with her, carried him home like
 a little child, and set him in a bath, where she chafed and laved him
 with warm water, until, the vital heat and some part of the strength
 which he had lost being restored, she saw fit to take him out and
 regale him with some good wine and comfits. Thus for some days
 she tended him as best she could, until he recovered his strength, and
 knew where he was. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02040025"/>Then, in due time, the good woman, who
 had kept his chest safe, gave it back to him, and bade him try his
 fortune.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02040026"/>Landolfo could not recall the chest, but took it when she brought
 it to him, thinking that, however slight its value, it must suffice for
 a few days' charges. He found it very light, and quite lost hope;
 but when the good woman was out of doors, he opened it to see
 what was inside, and found there a great number of precious stones,
 <pb n="91"/>some set, others unset. Having some knowledge of such matters,
 he saw at a glance that the stones were of great value; wherefore,
 feeling that he was still not forsaken by God, he praised His name,
 and quite recovered heart. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02040027"/>But, having in a brief space of time
 been twice shrewdly hit by the bolts of Fortune, he was apprehensive
 of a third blow, and deemed it meet to use much circumspection in
 conveying his treasure home; so he wrapped it up in rags as best
 he could, telling the good woman that he had no more use for the
 chest, but she might keep it if she wished, and give him a sack in
 exchange. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02040028"/>This the good woman readily did; and he, thanking
 her as heartily as he could for the service she had rendered him,
 threw his sack over his shoulders, and, taking ship, crossed to
 <placeName>Brindisi</placeName>. Thence he made his way by the coast as far as <placeName>Trani</placeName>,
 where he found some of his townsfolk that were drapers, to whom
 he narrated all his adventures except that of the chest. They in
 charity gave him a suit of clothes, and lent him a horse and their
 escort as far as <placeName>Ravello</placeName>, whither, he said, he was minded to return.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02040029"/>There, thanking God for bringing him safe home, he opened his sack,
 and examining its contents with more care than before, found the
 number and fashion of the stones to be such that the sale of them
 at a moderate price, or even less, would leave him twice as rich as
 when he left <placeName>Ravello</placeName>. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02040030"/>So, having disposed of his stones, he sent a
 large sum of money to <placeName>Corfu</placeName> in recompense of the service done him
 by the good woman who had rescued him from the sea, and also to
 his friends at <placeName>Trani</placeName> who had furnished him with the clothes; the
 residue he retained, and, making no more ventures in trade, lived
 and died in honourable estate.</p></div><pb n="92"/><!--*******************************Novella 5****************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0205"><head>Novel V</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050001"/><!--(i)-->Andreuccio da <placeName>Perugia</placeName> comes to <placeName>Naples</placeName> to buy horses,

 Andreuccio di Pietro by name, a horse-dealer, who, having learnt
 that horses were to be had cheap at <placeName>Naples</placeName>, put five hundred florins
 of gold in his purse, and in company with some other merchants
 went thither, never having been away from home before. On his
 arrival at <placeName>Naples</placeName>, which was on a Sunday evening, about vespers,
 he learnt from his host that the fair would be held on the following
 morning. Thither accordingly he then repaired, and looked at
 many horses which pleased him much, and cheapening them more
 and more, and failing to strike a bargain with any one, he from
 time to time, being raw and unwary, drew out his purse of florins
 in view of all that came and went, to shew that he meant business.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050004"/>While he was thus chaffering, and after he had shewn his purse,
 there chanced to come by a Sicilian girl, fair as fair could be, but
 ready to pleasure any man for a small consideration. He did not see
 her, but she saw him and his purse, and forthwith said to herself:
 <q>Who would be in better luck than I if all those florins were
	mine?</q> and so she passed on. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050005"/>With the girl was an old woman,
 <pb n="93"/>also a Sicilian, who, when she saw Andreuccio, dropped behind the
 girl, and ran towards him, making as if she would tenderly embrace
 him. The girl observing this said nothing, but stopped and waited
 a little way off for the old woman to rejoin her. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050006"/>Andreuccio turned
 as the old woman came up, recognised her, and greeted her very
 cordially; but time and place not permitting much converse, she
 left him, promising to visit him at his inn; and he resumed his
 chaffering, but bought nothing that morning.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050007"/>Her old woman's intimate acquaintance with Andreuccio had no
 more escaped the girl's notice than the contents of Andreuccio's
 purse; and with the view of devising, if possible, some way to make
 the money, either in whole or in part, her own, she began cautiously
 to ask the old woman, who and whence he was, what he did there,
 and how she came to know him. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050008"/>The old woman gave her almost
 as much and as circumstantial information touching Andreuccio and his
 affairs as he might have done himself, for she had lived a great while with
 his father, first in <placeName>Sicily</placeName>, and afterwards at <placeName>Perugia</placeName>. She likewise told
 the girl the name of his inn, and the purpose with which he had
 come to <placeName>Naples</placeName>. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050009"/>Thus fully armed with the names and all else that
 it was needful for her to know touching Andreuccio's kith and kin,
 the girl founded thereon her hopes of gratifying her cupidity, and
 forthwith devised a cunning stratagem to effect her purpose. Home
 she went, and gave the old woman work enough to occupy her all
 day, that she might not be able to visit Andreuccio; then, summoning
 to her aid a little girl whom she had well trained for such services,
 she sent her about vespers to the inn where Andreuccio lodged.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050010"/>Arrived there, the little girl asked for Andreuccio of Andreuccio
 himself, who chanced to be just outside the gate. On his answering
 that he was the man, she took him aside, and said: <q>Sir, a lady of
 this country, so please you, would fain speak with you.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050011"/>Whereto
 he listened with all his ears, and having a great conceit of his person,
 made up his mind that the lady was in love with him, as if there
 were ne'er another handsome fellow in <placeName>Naples</placeName> but himself; so forthwith
 he replied, that he would wait on the lady, and asked where
 and when it would be her pleasure to speak with him. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050012"/><q>Sir,</q> replied
 the little girl, <q>she expects you in her own house, if you be pleased
 to come.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050013"/><q>Lead on then, I follow thee,</q> said Andreuccio promptly,
 vouchsafing never a word to any in the inn. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050014"/>So the little girl guided
 <pb n="94"/>him to her mistress's house, which was situated in a quarter the
 character of which may be inferred from its name, Evil Hole.
 Of this, however, he neither knew nor suspected aught, but, supposing
 that the quarter was perfectly reputable and that he was going to see
 a sweet lady, strode carelessly behind the little girl into the house of
 her mistress, whom she summoned by calling out, <q>Andreuccio is
 here;</q> and Andreuccio then saw her advance to the head of the
 stairs to await his ascent. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050015"/>She was tall, still in the freshness of her
 youth, very fair of face, and very richly and nobly clad. As Andreuccio
 approached, she descended three steps to meet him with open
 arms, and clasped him round the neck, but for a while stood silent as
 if from excess of tenderness; then, bursting into a flood of tears, she
 kissed his brow, and in slightly broken accents said: <q>O Andreuccio,
 welcome, welcome, my Andreuccio.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050016"/>Quite lost in wonder
 to be the recipient of such caresses, Andreuccio could only answer:
 <q>Madam, well met.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050017"/>Whereupon she took him by the hand, led
 him up into her saloon, and thence without another word into her
 chamber, which exhaled throughout the blended fragrance of roses,
 orange-blossoms and other perfumes. He observed a handsome curtained
 bed, dresses in plenty hanging, as is customary in that country,
 on pegs, and other appointments very fair and sumptuous; which
 sights, being strange to him, confirmed his belief that he was in the
 house of no other than a great lady. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050018"/>They sate down side by side
 on a chest at the foot of the bed, and thus she began to speak:
 <q>Andreuccio, I cannot doubt that thou dost marvel both at the
 caresses which I bestow upon thee, and at my tears, seeing that thou
 knowest me not, and, maybe, hast never so much as heard my name;
 wait but a moment and thou shalt learn what perhaps will cause thee
 to marvel still more, to wit, that I am thy sister; and I tell thee,
 that, since of God's especial grace it is granted me to see one, albeit
 I would fain see all, of my brothers before I die, I shall not meet
 death, when the hour comes, without consolation; but thou, perchance,
 hast never heard aught of this; wherefore listen to what I
 shall say to thee. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050019"/>Pietro, my father and thine, as I suppose thou
 mayst have heard, dwelt a long while at <placeName>Palermo</placeName>, where his good
 heart and gracious bearing caused him to be (as he still is) much
 beloved by all that knew him; but by none was he loved so much as
 by a gentlewoman, afterwards my mother, then a widow, who, casting
 <pb n="95"/>aside all respect for her father and brothers, ay, and her honour,
 grew so intimate with him that a child was born, which child am I,
 thy sister, whom thou seest before thee. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050020"/>Shortly after my birth it so
 befell that Pietro must needs leave <placeName>Palermo</placeName> and return to <placeName>Perugia</placeName>, and
 I, his little daughter, was left behind with my mother at <placeName>Palermo</placeName>; nor,
 so far as I have been able to learn, did he ever again bestow a thought
 upon either of us. Wherefore--to say nothing of the love which he
 should have borne me, his daughter by no servant or woman of low
 degree--I should, were he not my father, gravely censure the ingratitude
 which he shewed towards my mother, who, prompted by a most
 loyal love, committed her fortune and herself to his keeping, without so
 much as knowing who he was. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050021"/>But to what end? The wrongs of
 long-ago are much more easily censured than redressed; enough that so
 it was. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050022"/>He left me a little girl at <placeName>Palermo</placeName>, where, when I was grown
 to be almost as thou seest me, my mother, who was a rich lady, gave
 me in marriage to an honest gentleman of the <placeName>Girgenti</placeName> family, who
 for love of my mother and myself settled in <placeName>Palermo</placeName>, and there, being
 a staunch Guelf, entered into correspondence with our King
 Charles;<note>Charles II. of <placeName>Naples</placeName>, son of Charles of Anjou.</note><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050023"/>which being discovered by King Frederic<note>Frederic II. of <placeName>Sicily</placeName>,
 younger son of Peter III. of Arragon.</note> before the time was ripe
 for action, we had perforce to flee from <placeName>Sicily</placeName> just when I was expecting
 to become the greatest lady that ever was in the island. So,
 taking with us such few things as we could, few, I say, in comparison
 of the abundance which we possessed, we bade adieu to our estates
 and palaces, and found a refuge in this country, and such favour with
 King Charles that, in partial compensation for the losses which we
 had sustained on his account, he has granted us estates and houses and
 an ample pension, which he regularly pays to my husband and thy
 brother-in-law, as thou mayst yet see. In this manner I live here;
 but that I am blest with the sight of thee, I ascribe entirely to the
 mercy of God; and no thanks to thee, my sweet brother.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050024"/>So saying
 she embraced him again, and melting anew into tears kissed his
 brow.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050025"/>This story, so congruous, so consistent in every detail, came trippingly
 and without the least hesitancy from her tongue. Andreuccio
 remembered that his father had indeed lived at <placeName>Palermo</placeName>; he knew by
 his own experience the ways of young folk, how prone they are to
 <pb n="96"/>love; he saw her melt into tears, he felt her embraces and sisterly
 kisses; and he took all she said for gospel. So, when she had done,
 he answered: 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050026"/><q>Madam, it should not surprise you that I marvel,
 seeing that, in sooth, my father, for whatever cause, said never a word
 of you and your mother, or, if he did so, it came not to my knowledge,
 so that I knew no more of you than if you had not been;
 wherefore, the lonelier I am here, and the less hope I had of such
 good luck, the better pleased I am to have found here my sister.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050027"/>And indeed, I know not any man, however exalted his station, who
 ought not to be well pleased to have such a sister; much more, then,
 I, who am but a petty merchant; but, I pray you, resolve me of one
 thing: how came you to know that I was here?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050028"/>Then answered
 she: <q>'Twas told me this morning by a poor woman who is much
 about the house, because, as she tells me, she was long in the service
 of our father both at <placeName>Palermo</placeName> and at <placeName>Perugia</placeName>; and, but that it seemed
 more fitting that thou shouldst come to see me at home than that I
 should visit thee at an inn, I had long ago sought thee out.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050029"/>She
 then began to inquire particularly after all his kinsfolk by name, and
 Andreuccio, becoming ever more firmly persuaded of that which it
 was least for his good to believe, answered all her questions. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050030"/>Their
 conversation being thus prolonged and the heat great, she had Greek
 wine and sweetmeats brought in, and gave Andreuccio to drink;
 and when towards supper-time he made as if he would leave, she
 would in no wise suffer it; but, feigning to be very much vexed, she
 embraced him, saying: 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050031"/><q>Alas! now 'tis plain how little thou carest
 for me: to think that thou art with thy sister, whom thou seest for
 the first time, and in her own house, where thou shouldst have
 alighted on thine arrival, and thou wouldst fain depart hence to go
 sup at an inn! Nay but, for certain, thou shalt sup with me; and
 albeit, to my great regret, my husband is not here, thou shalt see that
 I can do a lady's part in shewing thee honour.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050032"/>Andreuccio, not
 knowing what else to say, replied: <q>Sister, I care for you with all
 a brother's affection; but if I go not, supper will await me all the
 evening at the inn, and I shall justly be taxed with discourtesy.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050033"/>Then said she: <q>Blessed be God, there is even now in the house
 one by whom I can send word that they are not to expect thee at the
 inn, albeit thou wouldst far better discharge the debt of courtesy by
 sending word to thy friends, that they come here to sup; and then,
 <pb n="97"/>if go thou must, you might all go in a body.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050034"/>Andreuccio replied,
 that he would have none of his friends that evening, but since she
 would have him stay, he would even do her the pleasure. She then
 made a shew of sending word to the inn that they should not expect
 him at dinner. Much more talk followed; and then they sate down
 to a supper of many courses splendidly served, which she cunningly
 protracted until nightfall; nor, when they were risen from table, and
 Andreuccio was about to take his departure, would she by any means
 suffer it, saying, that <placeName>Naples</placeName> was no place to walk about in after
 dark, least of all for a stranger, and that, as she had sent word to the
 inn that they were not to expect him at supper, so she had done the
 like in regard of his bed. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050035"/>Believing what she said, and being (in his
 false confidence) overjoyed to be with her, he stayed. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050036"/>After supper
 there was matter enough for talk both various and prolonged; and,
 when the night was in a measure spent, she gave up her own chamber
 to Andreuccio, leaving him with a small boy to shew him aught that
 he might have need of, while she retired with her women to another
 chamber.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050037"/>It was a very hot night; so, no sooner was Andreuccio alone than
 he stripped himself to his doublet, and drew off his stockings and laid
 them on the bed's head; and nature demanding a discharge of the
 surplus weight which he carried within him, he asked the lad
 where this might be done, and was shewn a door in a corner of
 the room, and told to go in there. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050038"/>Andreuccio, nothing doubting,
 did so, but, by ill luck, set his foot on a plank which was detached
 from the joist at the further end, whereby down it went, and he
 with it. By God's grace he took no hurt by the fall, though it
 was from some height, beyond sousing himself from head to foot
 in the ordure which filled the whole place, which, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050039"/>that you may
 the better understand what has been said, and that which is to
 follow, I will describe to you. A narrow and blind alley, such as
 we commonly see between two houses, was spanned by planks
 supported by joists on either side, and on the planks was the stool;
 of which planks that which fell with Andreuccio was one. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050040"/>Now
 Andreuccio, finding himself down there in the alley, fell to calling on
 the lad, who, as soon as he heard him fall, had run off, and promptly
 let the lady know what had happened. She hied forthwith to her
 chamber, and after a hasty search found Andreuccio's clothes and the
 <pb n="98"/>money
 in them, for he foolishly thought to secure himself against
 risk by carrying it always on his person, and thus being possessed of
 the prize for which she had played her ruse, passing herself off as the
 sister of a man of <placeName>Perugia</placeName>, whereas she was really of <placeName>Palermo</placeName>, she
 concerned herself no further with Andreuccio except to close with
 all speed the door by which he had gone out when he fell. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050041"/>As the
 lad did not answer, Andreuccio began to shout more loudly; but all
 to no purpose. Whereby his suspicions were aroused, and he began
 at last to perceive the trick that had been played upon him; so he
 climbed over a low wall that divided the alley from the street, and
 hied him to the door of the house, which he knew very well. There
 for a long while he stood shouting and battering the door till it shook
 on its hinges; but all again to no purpose. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050042"/>No doubt of his misadventure
 now lurking in his mind, he fell to bewailing himself,
 saying: <q>Alas! in how brief a time have I lost five hundred florins
 and a sister!</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050043"/>with much more of the like sort. Then he recommenced
 battering the door and shouting, to such a tune that not a
 few of the neighbours were roused, and finding the nuisance intolerable,
 got up; and one of the lady's servant-girls presented herself at
 the window with a very sleepy air, and said angrily: <q>Who knocks
 below there?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050044"/><q>Oh!</q> said Andreuccio, <q>dost not know me? I
 am Andreuccio, Madam Fiordaliso's brother.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050045"/><q>Good man,</q> she
 rejoined, <q>if thou hast had too much to drink, go, sleep it off, and
 come back to-morrow. I know not Andreuccio, nor aught of the
 fantastic stuff thou pratest; prithee begone and be so good as to let
 us sleep in peace.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050046"/><q>How?</q> said Andreuccio, <q>dost not understand
 what I say? For sure thou dost understand; but if Sicilian kinships
 are of such a sort that folk forget them so soon, at least return me
 my clothes, which I left within, and right glad shall I be to be off.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050047"/>Half laughing she rejoined: <q>Good man, methinks thou dost
 dream:</q> and so saying, she withdrew and closed the window.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050048"/>Andreuccio by this time needed no further evidence of his wrongs;
 his wrath knew no bounds, and mortification well-nigh converted
 it into frenzy; he was minded to exact by force what he had
 failed to obtain by entreaties; and so, arming himself with a
 large stone, he renewed his attack upon the door with fury, dealing
 much heavier blows than at first. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050049"/>Wherefore, not a few of the
 neighbours, whom he had already roused from their beds, set him
 <pb n="99"/>down as an ill-conditioned rogue, and his story as a mere fiction
 intended to annoy the good woman,<note><!--(i)-->I. e.<!--(/i)--> the bawd.</note> and
 resenting the din which
 he now made, came to their windows, just as, when a stranger dog
 makes his appearance, all the dogs of the quarter will run to bark at
 him, and called out in chorus: 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050050"/><q>'Tis a gross affront to come at this
 time of night to the house of the good woman with this silly story.
 Prithee, good man, let us sleep in peace; begone in God's name; and
 if thou hast a score to settle with her, come to-morrow, but a truce
 to thy pestering to-night.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050051"/>Emboldened, perhaps, by these words, a man who lurked within
 the house, the good woman's bully, whom Andreuccio had as yet
 neither seen nor heard, shewed himself at the window, and said in a
 gruff voice and savage, menacing tone: <q>Who is below there?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050052"/>Andreuccio looked up in the direction of the voice, and saw standing
 at the window, yawning and rubbing his eyes as if he had just been
 roused from his bed, or at any rate from deep sleep, a fellow with a
 black and matted beard, who, as far as Andreuccio's means of judging
 went, bade fair to prove a most redoubtable champion. It was not
 without fear, therefore, that he replied: <q>I am a brother of the
 lady who is within.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050053"/>The bully did not wait for him to finish his
 sentence, but, addressing him in a much sterner tone than before,
 called out: <q>I know not why I come not down and give thee play
 with my cudgel, whilst thou givest me sign of life, ass, tedious driveller
 that thou must needs be, and drunken sot, thus to disturb our
 night's rest.</q> Which said, he withdrew, and closed the window.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050054"/>Some of the neighbours who best knew the bully's quality gave
 Andreuccio fair words. <q>For God's sake,</q> said they, <q>good man,
 take thyself off, stay not here to be murdered. 'Twere best for thee
 to go.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050055"/>These counsels, which seemed to be dictated by charity,
 reinforced the fear which the voice and aspect of the bully had
 inspired in Andreuccio, who, thus despairing of recovering his money
 and in the deepest of dumps, set his face towards the quarter whence
 in the daytime he had blindly followed the little girl, and began to
 make his way back to the inn. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050056"/>But so noisome was the stench
 which he emitted that he resolved to turn aside and take a bath in the
 sea. So he bore leftward up a street called <placeName>Ruga Catalana</placeName>, and was
 <pb n="100"/>on his way towards the steep of the city, when by chance he saw two
 men coming towards him, bearing a lantern, and fearing that they
 might be patrols or other men who might do him a mischief, he stole
 away and hid himself in a dismantled house to avoid them. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050057"/>The
 house, however, was presently entered by the two men, just as if they
 had been guided thither; and one of them having disburdened himself
 of some iron tools which he carried on his shoulder, they both
 began to examine them, passing meanwhile divers comments upon
 them. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050058"/>While they were thus occupied, <q>What,</q> said one, <q>means
 this? Such a stench as never before did I smell the like!</q> So
 saying, he raised the lantern a little; whereby they had a view of
 hapless Andreuccio, and asked in amazement: <q>Who is there?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050059"/>Whereupon Andreuccio was at first silent, but when they flashed
 the light close upon him, and asked him what he did there in such
 a filthy state, he told them all that had befallen him. Casting
 about to fix the place where it occurred, they said one to another:
 <q>Of a surety 'twas in the house of Scarabone <persName>Buttafuoco</persName>.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050060"/>Then
 said one, turning to Andreuccio: <q>Good man, albeit thou hast
 lost thy money, thou hast cause enough to praise God that thou
 hadst the luck to fall; for hadst thou not fallen, be sure that, no
 sooner wert thou asleep, than thou hadst been knocked on the head,
 and lost not only thy money but thy life. But what boots it now
 to bewail thee? Thou mightest as soon pluck a star from the
 firmament as recover a single denier; nay, 'tis as much as thy life
 is worth if he do but hear that thou breathest a word of the affair.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050061"/>The two men then held a short consultation, at the close of
 which they said: <q>Lo now; we are sorry for thee, and so we
 make thee a fair offer. If thou wilt join with us in a little matter
 which we have in hand, we doubt not but thy share of the gain
 will greatly exceed what thou hast lost.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050062"/>Andreuccio, being now
 desperate, answered that he was ready to join them. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050063"/>Now Messer
 <persName>Filippo</persName> Minutolo, Archbishop of <placeName>Naples</placeName>, had that day been buried
 with a ruby on his finger, worth over five hundred florins of gold,
 besides other ornaments of extreme value. The two men were
 minded to despoil the Archbishop of his fine trappings, and imparted
 their design to Andreuccio, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050064"/>who, cupidity getting the better of
 caution, approved it; and so they all three set forth. But as they
 were on their way to the cathedral, Andreuccio gave out so rank an
 <pb n="101"/>odour that one said to the other: <q>Can we not contrive that he
 somehow wash himself a little, that he stink not so shrewdly?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050065"/><q>Why yes,</q> said the other, <q>we are now close to a well, which
 is never without the pulley and a large bucket; 'tis but a step
 thither, and we will wash him out of hand.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050066"/>Arrived at the well,
 they found that the rope was still there, but the bucket had been
 removed; so they determined to attach him to the rope, and
 lower him into the well, there to wash himself, which done, he
 was to jerk the rope, and they would draw him up. Lowered
 accordingly he was; but just as, now washen, he jerked the rope, 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050067"/>it
 so happened that a company of patrols, being thirsty because 'twas a
 hot night and some rogue had led them a pretty dance, came to the
 well to drink. The two men fled, unobserved, as soon as they caught
 sight of the newcomers, who, parched with thirst, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050068"/>laid aside their
 bucklers, arms and surcoats, and fell to hauling on the rope, supposing
 that it bore the bucket, full of water. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050069"/>When, therefore, they saw
 Andreuccio, as he neared the brink of the well, loose the rope and
 clutch the brink with his hands, they were stricken with a sudden
 terror, and without uttering a word let go the rope, and took to flight
 with all the speed they could make. Whereat Andreuccio marvelled
 mightily, and had he not kept a tight grip on the brink of the well,
 he would certainly have gone back to the bottom and hardly have
 escaped grievous hurt, or death. Still greater was his astonishment,
 when, fairly landed on <!--(i)-->terra firma<!--(/i)-->, he found the patrols' arms lying
 there, which he knew had not been carried by his comrades. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050070"/>He
 felt a vague dread, he knew not why; he bewailed once more his
 evil fortune; and without venturing to touch the arms, he left the
 well and wandered he knew not whither. As he went, however, he
 fell in with his two comrades, now returning to draw him out of the
 well; who no sooner saw him than in utter amazement they
 demanded who had hauled him up. Andreuccio answered that he
 knew not, and then told them in detail how it had come about, and
 what he had found beside the well. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050071"/>They laughed as they apprehended
 the circumstances, and told him why they had fled, and who
 they were that had hauled him up. Then without further parley,
 for it was now midnight, they hied them to the cathedral. They had
 no difficulty in entering and finding the tomb, which was a magnificent
 structure of marble, and with their iron implements they raised
 <pb n="102"/>the lid, albeit it was very heavy, to a height sufficient to allow a man
 to enter, and propped it up. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050072"/>This done, a dialogue ensued. <q>Who
 shall go in?</q> said one. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050073"/><q>Not I,</q> said the other. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050074"/><q>Nor I,</q>
 rejoined his companion; <q>let Andreuccio go in.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050075"/><q>That will not I,</q> said Andreuccio. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050076"/>Whereupon both turned upon him and said:
 <q>How? thou wilt not go in? By God, if thou goest not in, we
 will give thee that over the pate with one of these iron crowbars
 that thou shalt drop down dead.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050077"/>Terror-stricken, into the tomb
 Andreuccio went, saying to himself as he did so: <q>These men will
 have me go in, that they may play a trick upon me: when I have
 handed everything up to them, and am sweating myself to get out
 of the tomb, they will be off about their business, and I shall be left
 with nothing for my pains.</q> So he determined to make sure of his
 own part first; and bethinking him of the precious ring of which he
 had heard them speak, as soon as he had completed the descent, he
 drew the ring off the Archbishop's finger, and put it on his own: he
 then handed up one by one the crosier, mitre and gloves, and other of
 the Archbishop's trappings, stripping him to his shirt; which done, he
 told his comrades that there was nothing more. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050078"/>They insisted that
 the ring must be there, and bade him search everywhere. This he
 feigned to do, ejaculating from time to time that he found it not;
 and thus he kept them a little while in suspense. But they, who
 were in their way as cunning as he, kept on exhorting him to make
 a careful search, and, seizing their opportunity, withdrew the prop
 that supported the lid of the tomb, and took to their heels, leaving
 him there a close prisoner. You will readily conceive how Andreuccio
 behaved when he understood his situation. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050079"/>More than once he
 applied his head and shoulders to the lid and sought with might and
 main to heave it up; but all his efforts were fruitless; so that at
 last, overwhelmed with anguish he fell in a swoon on the corpse of
 the Archbishop, and whether of the twain were the more lifeless,
 Andreuccio or the Archbishop, 'twould have puzzled an observer to
 determine.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050080"/>
      When he came to himself he burst into a torrent of tears, seeing
      now nothing in store for him but either to perish there of hunger
      and fetid odours beside the corpse and among the worms, or, should
      the tomb be earlier opened, to be taken and hanged as a thief. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050081"/>These
      most lugubrious meditations were interrupted by a sound of persons
      <pb n="103"/>walking and talking in the church. They were evidently a numerous
      company, and their purpose, as Andreuccio surmised, was the very
      same with which he and his comrades had come thither: whereby
      his terror was mightily increased. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050082"/>Presently the folk opened the
      tomb, and propped up the lid, and then fell to disputing as to who
      should go in. None was willing, and the contention was protracted;
      but at length one--'twas a priest--said: <q>Of what are ye afeared?
	Think ye to be eaten by him? Nay, the dead eat not the living. I
	will go in myself.</q> 
      So saying he propped his breast upon the edge
      of the lid, threw his head back, and thrust his legs within, that he
      might go down feet foremost. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050083"/>On sight whereof Andreuccio started
      to his feet, and seizing hold of one of the priest's legs, made as if he
      would drag him down; which caused the priest to utter a prodigious
      yell, and bundle himself out of the tomb with no small celerity.
      The rest took to flight in a panic, as if a hundred thousand devils
      were at their heels. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050084"/>The tomb being thus left open, Andreuccio, the
      ring still on his finger, sprang out. The way by which he had
      entered the church served him for egress, and roaming at random, he
      arrived towards daybreak at the coast. Diverging thence he came
      by chance upon his inn, where he found that his host and his
      comrades had been anxious about him all night. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02050085"/>When he told
      them all that had befallen him, they joined with the host in advising
      him to leave <placeName>Naples</placeName> at once. He accordingly did so, and returned
      to <placeName>Perugia</placeName>, having invested in a ring the money with which he had
      intended to buy horses.

      Emperor Frederic II. the crown of <placeName>Sicily</placeName> passed to Manfred; whose
      favour was enjoyed in the highest degree by a gentleman of <placeName>Naples</placeName>,
      Arrighetto Capece by name, who had to wife Madonna Beritola
      Caracciola, a fair and gracious lady, likewise a Neapolitan. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060006"/>Now
      <pb n="105"/>when Manfred was conquered and slain by King Charles I. at
      <placeName>Benevento</placeName>, and the whole realm transferred its allegiance to the
      conqueror, Arrighetto, who was then governor of <placeName>Sicily</placeName>, no sooner
      received the tidings than he prepared for instant flight, knowing that
      little reliance was to be placed on the fleeting faith of the Sicilians,
      and not being minded to become a subject of his master's enemy.
      <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060007"/>But the Sicilians having intelligence of his plans, he and many other
      friends and servants of King Manfred were surprised, taken prisoners
      and delivered over to King Charles, to whom the whole island was
      soon afterwards surrendered. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060008"/>In this signal reversal of the wonted
      course of things Madam Beritola, knowing not what was become
      of Arrighetto, and from the past ever auguring future evil, lest she
      should suffer foul dishonour, abandoned all that she possessed, and with
      a son of, perhaps, eight years, Giusfredi by name, being also pregnant,
      fled in a boat to <placeName>Lipari</placeName>, where she gave birth to another male child,
      whom she named Outcast. Then with her sons and a hired nurse
      she took ship for <placeName>Naples</placeName>, intending there to rejoin her family.
      <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060009"/>Events, however, fell out otherwise than she expected; for by stress
      of weather the ship was carried out of her course to the desert
      island of <placeName>Ponza</placeName>,<note>The largest, now inhabited, of a group of islets in
	the
	Gulf of <placeName>Gaeta</placeName>.</note> where they put in to a little bay until such time
      as they might safely continue their voyage. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060010"/>Madam Beritola
      landed with the rest on the island, and, leaving them all, sought out
      a lonely and secluded spot, and there abandoned herself to melancholy
      brooding on the loss of her dear Arrighetto. While thus she spent
      her days in solitary preoccupation with her grief it chanced that a
      galley of corsairs swooped down upon the island, and, before either
      the mariners or any other folk were aware of their peril, made
      an easy capture of them all and sailed away; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060011"/>so that, when Madam
      Beritola, her wailing for that day ended, returned, as was her wont,
      to the shore to solace herself with the sight of her sons, she found
      none there. At first she was lost in wonder, then with a sudden
      suspicion of the truth she bent her eyes seaward, and there saw the
 galley still at no great distance, towing the ship in her wake. Thus
 apprehending beyond all manner of doubt that she had lost her sons
 as well as her husband, and that, alone, desolate and destitute, she
 might not hope that any of her lost ones would ever be restored to
 <pb n="106"/>her, she fell down on the shore in a swoon with the names of her
 husband and sons upon her lips. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060012"/>None was there to administer cold
 water or aught else that might recall her truant powers; her animal
 spirits might even wander whithersoever they would at their sweet
 will: strength, however, did at last return to her poor exhausted
 frame, and therewith tears and lamentations, as, plaintively repeating
 her sons' names, she roamed in quest of them from cavern to cavern.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060013"/>Long time she sought them thus; but when she saw that her labour
 was in vain, and that night was closing in, hope, she knew not why,
 began to return, and with it some degree of anxiety on her own
 account. Wherefore she left the shore and returned to the cavern
 where she had been wont to indulge her plaintive mood. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060014"/>She
 passed the night in no small fear and indescribable anguish; the new
 day came, and, as she had not supped, she was fain after tierce to
 appease her hunger, as best she could, by a breakfast of herbs: this
 done, she wept and began to ruminate on her future way of life.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060015"/>While thus engaged, she observed a she-goat come by and go into
 an adjacent cavern, and after a while come forth again and go into
 the wood: thus roused from her reverie she got up, went into the
 cavern from which the she-goat had issued, and there saw two kids,
 which might have been born that very day, and seemed to her the
 sweetest and the most delicious things in the world: and, having,
 by reason of her recent delivery, milk still within her, she took them
 up tenderly, and set them to her breast. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060016"/>They, nothing loath,
 sucked at her teats as if she had been their own dam; and thenceforth
 made no distinction between her and the dam. Which caused
 the lady to feel that she had found company in the desert; and so,
 living on herbs and water, weeping as often as she bethought her
 of her husband and sons and her past life, she disposed herself to
 live and die there, and became no less familiar with the she-goat
 than with her young.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060017"/>The gentle lady thus leading the life of a wild creature, it
 chanced that after some months stress of weather brought a Pisan

 servants and his dogs, set forth one day upon a tour through the
 island. As they neared the place where Madam Beritola dwelt,
 <persName>Currado</persName>'s dogs on view of the two kids, which, now of a fair size,
 were grazing, gave chase. The kids, pursued by the dogs, made
 straight for Madam Beritola's cavern. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060020"/>She, seeing what was toward,
 started to her feet, caught up a stick, and drove the dogs back.
 <persName>Currado</persName> and his lady coming up after the dogs, gazed on Madam
 Beritola, now tanned and lean and hairy, with wonder, which she
 more than reciprocated. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060021"/>At her request <persName>Currado</persName> called off the
 dogs; and then he and his lady besought her again and again to
 say who she was and what she did there. So she told them all
 about herself, her rank, her misfortunes, and the savage life which
 she was minded to lead. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060022"/><persName>Currado</persName>, who had known Arrighetto
 Capece very well, was moved to tears by compassion, and exhausted
 all his eloquence to induce her to change her mind, offering to escort
 her home, or to take her to live with him in honourable estate as his
 sister until God should vouchsafe her kindlier fortune. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060023"/>The lady
 declining all his offers, <persName>Currado</persName> left her with his wife, whom he bade
 see that food was brought thither, and let Madam Beritola, who was
 all in rags, have one of her own dresses to wear, and do all that she
 could to persuade her to go with them. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060024"/>So the gentle lady stayed
 with Madam Beritola, and after condoling with her at large on her
 misfortunes had food and clothing brought to her, and with the
 greatest difficulty in the world prevailed upon her to eat and dress
 herself. At last, after much beseeching, she induced her to depart
 from her oft-declared intention never to go where she might meet
 any that knew her, and accompany them to <placeName>Lunigiana</placeName>, taking with
 her the two kids and the dam, which latter had in the meantime
 returned, and to the gentle lady's great surprise had greeted
 Madam Beritola with the utmost affection. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060025"/>So with the return
 of fair weather Madam Beritola, taking with her the dam and the
 two kids, embarked with <persName>Currado</persName> and his lady on their ship, being
 called by them--for her true name was not to be known of
 all--Cavriuola;<note><!--(i)-->I. e.<!--(/i)--> she-goat.</note> and the wind holding
 fair, they speedily reached the
 mouth of the <placeName>Magra</placeName>,<note>Between Liguria and <placeName>Tuscany</placeName>.</note> and landing
 hied
 them to <persName>Currado</persName>'s castle;
 <pb n="108"/><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060026"/>where Madam Beritola abode with <persName>Currado</persName>'s lady in the quality of
 her maid, serving her well and faithfully, wearing widow's weeds,
 and feeding and tending her kids with assiduous and loving care.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060027"/>The corsairs, who, not espying Madam Beritola, had left her at
 <placeName>Ponza</placeName> when they took the ship on which she had come thither,
 had made a course to <placeName>Genoa</placeName>, taking with them all the other folk.
 On their arrival the owners of the galley shared the booty, and so
 it happened that as part thereof Madam Beritola's nurse and her two
 boys fell to the lot of one Messer Guasparrino d'Oria, who sent all
 three to his house, being minded to keep them there as domestic
 slaves. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060028"/>The nurse, beside herself with grief at the loss of her
 mistress and the woful plight in which she found herself and her
 two charges, shed many a bitter tear. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060029"/>But, seeing that they were
 unavailing, and that she and the boys were slaves together, she,
 having, for all her low estate, her share of wit and good sense, made
 it her first care to comfort them; then, regardful of the condition
 to which they were reduced, she bethought her, that, if the lads were
 recognised, 'twould very likely be injurious to them. So, still hoping
 that some time or another Fortune would change her mood, and
 they be able, if living, to regain their lost estate, she resolved to let
 none know who they were, until she saw a fitting occasion; and
 accordingly, whenever she was questioned thereof by any, she gave
 them out as her own children. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060030"/>The name of the elder she changed
 from Giusfredi to Giannotto di <placeName>Procida</placeName>; the name of the younger
 she did not think it worth while to change. She spared no pains
 to make Giusfredi understand the reason why she had changed his
 name, and the risk which he might run if he were recognised.
 This she impressed upon him not once only but many times; and
 the boy, who was apt to learn, followed the instructions of the wise
 nurse with perfect exactitude.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060031"/>So the two boys, ill clad and worse shod, continued with the
 nurse in Messer Guasparrino's house for two years, patiently performing
 all kinds of menial offices. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060032"/>But Giannotto, being now
 sixteen years old, and of a spirit that consorted ill with servitude,
 brooked not the baseness of his lot, and dismissed himself from
 Messer Guasparrino's service by getting aboard a galley bound
 for <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>, and travelled far and wide, and fared never the
 better. In the course of his wanderings he learned that his father,
 <pb n="109"/>whom he had supposed to be dead, was still living, but kept in prison
 under watch and ward by King Charles. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060033"/>He was grown a tall
 handsome young man, when, perhaps three or four years after he
 had given Messer Guasparrino the slip, weary of roaming and all
 but despairing of his fortune, he came to <placeName>Lunigiana</placeName>, and by chance
 took service with <persName>Currado</persName> Malespini, who found him handy, and
 was well-pleased with him. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060034"/>His mother, who was in attendance
 on <persName>Currado</persName>'s lady, he seldom saw, and never recognised her, nor
 she him; so much had time changed both from their former aspect
 since they last met. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060035"/>While Giannotto was thus in the service of
 <persName>Currado</persName>, it fell out by the death of Niccolò da Grignano that his
 widow, Spina, <persName>Currado</persName>'s daughter, returned to her father's house.
 Very fair she was and loveable, her age not more than sixteen years,
 and so it was that she saw Giannotto with favour, and he her, and
 both fell ardently in love with one another. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060036"/>Their passion was
 early gratified; but several months elapsed before any detected its
 existence. Wherefore, growing overbold, they began to dispense with
 the precautions which such an affair demanded. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060037"/>So one day, as
 they walked with others through a wood, where the trees grew fair
 and close, the girl and Giannotto left the rest of the company some
 distance behind, and, thinking that they were well in advance, found
 a fair pleasaunce girt in with trees and carpeted with abundance of
 grass and flowers, and fell to solacing themselves after the manner
 of lovers. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060038"/>Long time they thus dallied, though such was their
 delight that all too brief it seemed to them, and so it befell that they
 were surprised first by the girl's mother and then by <persName>Currado</persName>.
 Pained beyond measure by what he had seen, <persName>Currado</persName>, without
 assigning any cause, had them both arrested by three of his servants
 and taken in chains to one of his castles; where in a frenzy of
 passionate wrath he left them, resolved to put them to an ignominious
 death. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060039"/>The girl's mother was also very angry, and deemed her
 daughter's fall deserving of the most rigorous chastisement, but,
 when by one of <persName>Currado</persName>'s chance words she divined the doom which
 he destined for the guilty pair, she could not reconcile herself to
 it, and hasted to intercede with her angry husband, beseeching him
 to refrain the impetuous wrath which would hurry him in his
 old age to murder his daughter and imbrue his hands in the
 blood of his servant, and vent it in some other way, as by close
 <pb n="110"/>confinement and duress, whereby the culprits should be brought to
 repent them of their fault in tears. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060040"/>Thus, and with much more
 to the like effect, the devout lady urged her suit, and at length
 prevailed upon her husband to abandon his murderous design.
 Wherefore, he commanded that the pair should be confined in
 separate prisons, and closely guarded, and kept short of food and
 in sore discomfort, until further order; which was accordingly done;
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060041"/>and the life which the captives led, their endless tears, their fasts of
 inordinate duration, may be readily imagined.</p><p>Giannotto and Spina had languished in this sorry plight for full
 a year, entirely ignored by <persName>Currado</persName>, when in concert with Messer
 Gian di <placeName>Procida</placeName>, King Peter of Arragon raised a rebellion<note>The Sicilian
 Vespers, Easter, 1282.</note> in the island
 of <placeName>Sicily</placeName>, and wrested it from King Charles, whereat <persName>Currado</persName>, being a
 Ghibelline, was overjoyed. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060042"/>Hearing the tidings from one of his warders,
 Giannotto heaved a great sigh, and said: <q>Alas, fourteen years have I
 been a wanderer upon the face of the earth, looking for no other than
 this very event; and now, that my hopes of happiness may be for ever
 frustrate, it has come to pass only to find me in prison, whence I
 may never think to issue alive.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060043"/><q>How?</q> said the warder; <q>what
 signify to thee these doings of these mighty monarchs? What part
 hadst thou in <placeName>Sicily</placeName>?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060044"/>Giannotto answered: <q>'Tis as if my heart
 were breaking when I bethink me of my father and what part he had
 in <placeName>Sicily</placeName>. I was but a little lad when I fled the island, but yet I
 remember him as its governor in the time of King Manfred.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060045"/><q>And who then was thy father?</q> demanded the warder. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060046"/><q>His
 name,</q> rejoined Giannotto, <q>I need no longer scruple to disclose,
 seeing that I find myself in the very strait which I hoped to avoid by
 concealing it. He was and still is, if he live, Arrighetto Capece;
 and my name is not Giannotto but Giusfredi; and I doubt not but,
 were I once free, and back in <placeName>Sicily</placeName>, I might yet hold a very honourable
 position in the island.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060047"/>The worthy man asked no more questions, but, as soon as he found
 opportunity, told what he had learned to <persName>Currado</persName>; who, albeit he
 made light of it in the warder's presence, repaired to Madam Beritola,
 and asked her in a pleasant manner, whether she had had by Arrighetto
 a son named Giusfredi. The lady answered, in tears, that, if
 <pb n="111"/>the elder of her two sons were living, such would be his name, and
 his age twenty-two years. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060048"/>This inclined <persName>Currado</persName> to think that
 Giannotto and Giusfredi were indeed one and the same; and it
 occurred to him, that, if so it were, he might at once shew himself
 most merciful and blot out his daughter's shame and his own by
 giving her to him in marriage; wherefore he sent for Giannotto
 privily, and questioned him in detail touching his past life. And
 finding by indubitable evidence that he was indeed Giusfredi, son of
 Arrighetto Capece, he said to him: 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060049"/><q>Giannotto, thou knowest the
 wrong which thou hast done me in the person of my daughter, what
 and how great it is, seeing that I used thee well and kindly, and thou
 shouldst therefore, like a good servant, have shewn thyself jealous
 of my honour, and zealous in my interest; and many there are who,
 hadst thou treated them as thou hast treated me, would have caused
 thee to die an ignominious death; which my clemency would not
 brook. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060050"/>But now, as it is even so as thou sayst, and thou art of
 gentle blood by both thy parents, I am minded to put an end to thy
 sufferings as soon as thou wilt, releasing thee from the captivity in
 which thou languishest, and setting thee in a happy place, and reinstating
 at once thy honour and my own. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060051"/>Thy intimacy with Spina--albeit
 shameful to both--was yet prompted by love. Spina, as
 thou knowest, is a widow, and her dower is ample and secure. What
 her breeding is, and her father's and her mother's, thou knowest:
 of thy present condition I say nought. Wherefore, when thou wilt,
 I am consenting, that, having been with dishonour thy friend, she
 become with honour thy wife, and that, so long as it seem good to
 thee, thou tarry here with her and me as my son.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060052"/>Captivity had wasted Giannotto's flesh, but had in no degree
 impaired the generosity of spirit which he derived from his ancestry,
 or the whole-hearted love which he bore his lady. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060053"/>So, albeit he
 ardently desired that which <persName>Currado</persName> offered, and knew that he was
 in <persName>Currado</persName>'s power, yet, even as his magnanimity prompted, so,
 unswervingly, he made answer: <q><persName>Currado</persName>, neither ambition nor
 cupidity nor aught else did ever beguile me to any treacherous
 machination against either thy person or thy property. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060054"/>Thy daughter
 I loved, and love and shall ever love, because I deem her worthy of
 my love; and, if I dealt with her after a fashion which to the
 mechanic mind seems hardly honourable, I did but commit that fault
 <pb n="112"/>which is ever congenial to youth, which can never be eradicated so
 long as youth continues, and which, if the aged would but remember
 that they were once young and would measure the delinquencies
 of others by their own and their own by those of others, would not
 be deemed so grave as thou and many others depict it; and what
 I did, I did as a friend, not as an enemy. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060055"/>That which thou offerest
 I have ever desired, and should long ago have sought, had I supposed
 that thou wouldst grant it, and 'twill be the more grateful to me in
 proportion to the depth of my despair. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060056"/>But if thy intent be not such
 as thy words import, feed me not with vain hopes, but send me back
 to prison there to suffer whatever thou mayst be pleased to inflict; nor
 doubt that even as I love Spina, so for love of her shall I ever love
 thee, though thou do thy worst, and still hold thee in reverent
 regard.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060057"/><persName>Currado</persName> marvelled to hear him thus speak, and being assured of
 his magnanimity and the fervour of his love, held him the more dear;
 wherefore he rose, embraced and kissed him, and without further
 delay bade privily bring thither Spina, who left her prison wasted and
 wan and weak, and so changed that she seemed almost another
 woman than of yore, even as Giannotto was scarce his former self.
 Then and there in <persName>Currado</persName>'s presence they plighted their troth
 according to our custom of espousals; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060058"/>and some days afterwards
 <persName>Currado</persName>, having in the meantime provided all things meet for their
 convenience and solace, yet so as that none should surmise what had
 happened, deemed it now time to gladden their mothers with the
 news. So he sent for his lady and Cavriuola, and thus, addressing first
 Cavriuola, he spoke: <q>What would you say, madam, were I to
 restore you your elder son as the husband of one of my daughters?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060059"/>Cavriuola answered: <q>I should say, that, were it possible for you
 to strengthen the bond which attaches me to you, then assuredly you
 had so done, in that you restored to me that which I cherish more
 tenderly than myself, and in such a guise as in some measure to renew
 within me the hope which I had lost: more I could not say.</q> And
 so, weeping, she was silent. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060060"/>Then, turning to his lady, <persName>Currado</persName> said:
 <q>And thou, madam, what wouldst thou think if I were to present
 thee with such a son-in-law?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060061"/><q>A son-in-law,</q> she answered,
 <q>that was not of gentle blood, but a mere churl, so he pleased you,
 would well content me.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060062"/><q>So!</q> returned <persName>Currado</persName>; <q>I hope within
 a few days to gladden the hearts of both of you.</q></p><pb n="113"/><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060063"/>He waited only until the two young folk had recovered their
 wonted mien, and were clad in a manner befitting their rank. Then,
 addressing Giusfredi, he said: <q>Would it not add to thy joy to see
 thy mother here?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060064"/><q>I dare not hope,</q> returned Giusfredi, <q>that she
 has survived calamities and sufferings such as hers; but were it so,
 great indeed would be my joy, and none the less that by her counsel
 I might be aided to the recovery (in great measure) of my lost heritage
 in <placeName>Sicily</placeName>.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060065"/>Whereupon <persName>Currado</persName> caused both the ladies to come
 thither, and presented to them the bride. The gladness with which
 they both greeted her was a wonder to behold, and no less great was
 their wonder at the benign inspiration that had prompted <persName>Currado</persName> to
 unite her in wedlock with Giannotto, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060066"/>whom <persName>Currado</persName>'s words caused
 Madam Beritola to survey with some attention. A hidden spring of
 memory was thus touched; she recognised in the man the lineaments
 of her boy, and awaiting no further evidence she ran with open arms
 and threw herself upon his neck. No word did she utter, for very
 excess of maternal tenderness and joy; but, every avenue of sense
 closed, she fell as if bereft of life within her son's embrace. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060067"/>Giannotto,
 who had often seen her in the castle and never recognised her,
 marvelled not a little, but nevertheless it at once flashed upon him
 that 'twas his mother, and blaming himself for his past inadvertence
 he took her in his arms and wept and tenderly kissed her. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060068"/>With gentle
 solicitude <persName>Currado</persName>'s lady and Spina came to her aid, and restored her
 suspended animation with cold water and other remedies. She then
 with many tender and endearing words kissed him a thousand times
 or more, which tokens of her love he received with a look of reverential
 acknowledgment. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060069"/>Thrice, nay a fourth time were these glad
 and gracious greetings exchanged, and joyful indeed were they that
 witnessed them, and hearkened while mother and son compared their
 past adventures. Then <persName>Currado</persName>, who had already announced his new
 alliance to his friends, and received their felicitations, proceeded to
 give order for the celebration of the event with all becoming gaiety
 and splendour. As he did so, Giusfredi said to him: 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060070"/><q><persName>Currado</persName>, you
 have long given my mother honourable entertainment, and on me
 you have conferred many boons; wherefore, that you may fill up the
 measure of your kindness, 'tis now my prayer that you be pleased to
 gladden my mother and my marriage feast and me with the presence
 of my brother, now in servitude in the house of Messer Guasparrino
 <pb n="114"/>d'Oria, who, as I have already told you, made prize of both him and
 me; and that then you send some one to <placeName>Sicily</placeName>, who shall make himself
 thoroughly acquainted with the circumstances and condition of
 the country, and find out how it has fared with my father Arrighetto,
 whether he be alive or dead, and if alive, in what circumstances, and
 being thus fully informed, return to us with the tidings.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060071"/><persName>Currado</persName>
 assented, and forthwith sent most trusty agents both to <placeName>Genoa</placeName> and to
 <placeName>Sicily</placeName>. So in due time an envoy arrived at <placeName>Genoa</placeName>, and made instant
 suit to Guasparrino on <persName>Currado</persName>'s part for the surrender of Outcast and
 the nurse, setting forth in detail all that had passed between <persName>Currado</persName>
 and Giusfredi and his mother. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060072"/>Whereat Messer Guasparrino was
 mightily astonished, and said: <q>Of a surety there is nought that, being
 able, I would not do to pleasure <persName>Currado</persName>; and true it is that I have
 had in my house for these fourteen years the boy whom thou dost now
 demand of me, and his mother, and gladly will I surrender them; but
 tell <persName>Currado</persName> from me to beware of excessive credulity, and to put no
 faith in the idle tales of Giannotto, or Giusfredi, as thou sayst he
 calls himself, who is by no means so guileless as he supposes.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060073"/>Then, having provided for the honourable entertainment of the
 worthy envoy, he sent privily for the nurse, and cautiously sounded
 her as to the affair. The nurse had heard of the revolt of <placeName>Sicily</placeName>, and
 had learned that Arrighetto was still alive. She therefore banished
 fear, and told Messer Guasparrino the whole story, and explained to
 him the reasons why she had acted as she had done. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060074"/>Finding that
 what she said accorded very well with what he had learned from
 <persName>Currado</persName>'s envoy, he inclined to credit the story, and most astutely
 probing the matter in divers ways, and always finding fresh grounds
 for confidence, he reproached himself for the sorry manner in which
 he had treated the boy, and by way of amends gave him one of his
 own daughters, a beautiful girl of eleven years, to wife with a dowry
 suited to Arrighetto's rank, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060075"/>and celebrated their nuptials with great
 festivity. He then brought the boy and girl, <persName>Currado</persName>'s envoy, and the
 nurse in a well-armed galliot to <placeName>Lerici</placeName>, being there met by <persName>Currado</persName>,
 who had a castle not far off, where great preparations had been made
 for their entertainment: and thither accordingly he went with his
 whole company. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060076"/>What cheer the mother had of her son, the brothers
 of one another, and all the three of the faithful nurse; what cheer
 Messer Guasparrino and his daughter had of all, and all of them, and
 <pb n="115"/>what cheer all had of <persName>Currado</persName> and his lady and their sons and their
 friends, words may not describe; wherefore, my ladies, I leave it to
 your imagination. And that their joy might be full, God, who, when
 He gives, gives most abundantly, added the glad tidings that Arrighetto
 Capece was alive and prosperous. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060077"/>For, when in the best of spirits the
 ladies and gentlemen had sat them down to feast, and they were yet
 at the first course, the envoy from <placeName>Sicily</placeName> arrived, and among other
 matters reported, that, no sooner had the insurrection broken out in the
 island than the people hied them in hot haste to the prison where
 Arrighetto was kept in confinement by King Charles, and despatching
 the guards, brought him forth, and knowing him to be a capital
 enemy to King Charles made him their captain, and under his command
 fell upon and massacred the French. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060078"/>Whereby he had won
 the highest place in the favour of King Peter, who had granted him
 restitution of all his estates and honours, so that he was now both
 prosperous and mighty. The envoy added that Arrighetto had
 received him with every token of honour, had manifested the utmost
 delight on hearing of his lady and son, of whom no tidings had reached
 him since his arrest, and had sent, to bring them home, a brigantine
 with some gentlemen aboard, whose arrival might hourly be expected.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060079"/>The envoy, and the good news which he brought, were heartily
 welcome; and presently <persName>Currado</persName>, with some of his friends, encountered
 the gentlemen who came for Madam Beritola and Giusfredi, and
 saluting them cordially invited them to his feast, which was not yet
 half done. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060080"/>Joy unheard-of was depicted on the faces of the lady, of
 Giusfredi, and of all the rest as they greeted them; nor did they on
 their part take their places at the table before, as best they might,
 they had conveyed to <persName>Currado</persName> and his lady Arrighetto's greetings and
 grateful acknowledgments of the honour which they had conferred
 upon his lady and his son, and had placed Arrighetto, to the uttermost
 of his power, entirely at their service. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060081"/>Then, turning to Messer
 Guasparrino, of whose kindness Arrighetto surmised nothing, they
 said that they were very sure that, when he learned the boon which
 Outcast had received at his hands, he would pay him the like and an
 even greater tribute of gratitude. This speech ended, they feasted
 most joyously with the brides and bridegrooms. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060082"/>So passed the day,
 the first of many which <persName>Currado</persName> devoted to honouring his son-in-law
 and his other intimates, both kinsfolk and friends. The time of
 <pb n="116"/>festivity ended, Madam Beritola and Giusfredi and the rest felt that
 they must leave: so, taking Spina with them, they parted, not
 without many tears, from <persName>Currado</persName> and his lady and Guasparrino, and
 went aboard the brigantine, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02060083"/>which, wafted by a prosperous wind,
 soon brought them to <placeName>Sicily</placeName>. At <placeName>Palermo</placeName> they were met by
 Arrighetto, who received them all, ladies and sons alike, with such
 cheer as it were vain to attempt to describe. There it is believed
 that they all lived long and happily and in amity with God, being
 not unmindful of the blessings which He had conferred upon them.</p></div><pb n="117"/><!--*********************************Novella 7***************************--><!--*********<persName>Alatiel</persName>*******--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0207"><head>Novel VII</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070001"/><!--(i)-->The Soldan of <placeName>Babylon</placeName> sends one of his daughters overseas,

 now that it was ended, the Queen bade Pamfilo follow suit; and he,

 for our good; insomuch that, as has been observable in a multitude
 of instances, many, deeming that the acquisition of great riches would
 ensure them an easy and tranquil existence, have not only besought
 them of God in prayer, but have sought them with such ardour that
 they have spared no pains and shrunk from no danger in the quest,
 and have attained their end only to lose, at the hands of some one
 covetous of their vast inheritance, a life with which before the days
 of their prosperity they were well content. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070004"/>Others, whose course,
 perilous with a thousand battles, stained with the blood of their
 brothers and their friends, has raised them from base to regal estate,
 have found in place of the felicity they expected an infinity of cares
 and fears, and have proved by experience that a chalice may be
 poisoned, though it be of gold, and set on the table of a king. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070005"/>Many
 <pb n="118"/>have most ardently desired beauty and strength and other advantages
 of person, and have only been taught their error by the death or
 dolorous life which these very advantages entailed upon them.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070006"/>And so, not to instance each particular human desire, I say, in sum,
 that there is none of them that men may indulge in full confidence
 as exempt from the chances and changes of fortune; wherefore, if we
 would act rightly, we ought to school ourselves to take and be
 content with that which He gives us, who alone knows and can
 afford us that of which we have need. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070007"/>But, divers as are the
 aberrations of desire to which men are prone, so, gracious ladies,
 there is one to which you are especially liable, in that you are unduly
 solicitous of beauty, insomuch, that, not content with the charms
 which nature has allotted you, you endeavour to enhance them with
 wondrous ingenuity of art; wherefore I am minded to make you
 acquainted with the coil of misadventures in which her beauty
 involved a fair Saracen, who in the course of, perhaps, four years was
 wedded nine several times.</p></body></floatingText><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070008"/>There was of yore a Soldan of <placeName>Babylon</placeName>,<note><!--(i)-->I. e.<!--(/i)--> according to
 medieval usage, <placeName>Egypt</placeName>.</note> by name of Beminedab,
 who in his day had cause enough to be well content with his luck.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070009"/>Many children male and female had he, and among them a daughter,
 <persName>Alatiel</persName> by name, who by common consent of all that saw her was
 the most beautiful woman then to be found in the world. Now the
 Soldan, having been signally aided by the King of Algarve<note><!--(i)-->I. e.<!--(/i)--><placeName>Garbo</placeName>, the coast of Africa opposite Andalusia and <placeName>Granada</placeName>.</note> in
 inflicting a great defeat upon a host of Arabs that had attacked him,
 had at his instance and by way of special favour given <persName>Alatiel</persName> to the
 King to wife; wherefore, with an honourable escort of gentlemen
 and ladies most nobly and richly equipped, he placed her aboard a
 well-armed, well-furnished ship, and, commending her to God, sped
 her on her journey. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070010"/>The mariners, as soon as the weather was
 favourable, hoisted sail, and for some days after their departure from
 <placeName>Alexandria</placeName> had a prosperous voyage; but when they had passed
 <placeName>Sardinia</placeName>, and were beginning to think that they were nearing their
 journey's end, they were caught one day between divers cross winds,
 each blowing with extreme fury, whereby the ship laboured so sorely
 that not only the lady but the seamen from time to time gave them<pb n="119"/>selves
 up for lost. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070011"/>But still, most manfully and skilfully they
 struggled might and main with the tempest, which, ever waxing
 rather than waning, buffeted them for two days with immense unintermittent
 surges; and being not far from the island of <placeName>Majorca</placeName>, as
 the third night began to close in, wrapt in clouds and mist and thick
 darkness, so that they saw neither the sky nor aught else, nor by any
 nautical skill might conjecture where they were, they felt the ship's
 timbers part. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070012"/>Wherefore, seeing no way to save the ship, each thought
 only how best to save himself, and, a boat being thrown out, the
 masters first, and then the men, one by one, though the first-comers
 sought with knives in their hands to bar the passage of the rest, all,
 rather than remain in the leaky ship, crowded into it, and there
 found the death which they hoped to escape. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070013"/>For the boat, being in
 such stress of weather and with such a burden quite unmanageable,
 went under, and all aboard her perished; whereas the ship, leaky
 though she was, and all but full of water, yet, driven by the fury of
 the tempest, was hurled with prodigious velocity upon the shore of
 the island of <placeName>Majorca</placeName>, and struck it with such force as to embed
 herself in the sand, perhaps a stone's throw from <!--(i)-->terra firma<!--(/i)-->, where
 she remained all night beaten and washed by the sea, but no more
 to be moved by the utmost violence of the gale. None had remained
 aboard her but the lady and her women, whom the malice of
 the elements and their fears had brought to the verge of death.
      <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070014"/>When it was broad day and the storm was somewhat abated, the
 lady, half dead, raised her head, and in faltering accents began to call
 first one and then another of her servants. She called in vain, however;
 for those whom she called were too far off to hear. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070015"/>Great
 indeed was her wonder and fear to find herself thus without sight of
 human face or sound of other voice than her own; but, struggling
 to her feet as best she might, she looked about her, and saw the ladies
 that were of her escort, and the other women, all prostrate on the
 deck; so, after calling them one by one, she began at length to touch
 them, and finding few that shewed sign of life, for indeed, between
 grievous sea-sickness and fear, they had little life left, she grew more
 terrified than before. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070016"/>However, being in sore need of counsel, all
 alone as she was, and without knowledge or means of learning where
 she was, she at last induced such as had life in them to get upon their
 feet, with whom, as none knew where the men were gone, and the
 <pb n="120"/>ship was now full of water and visibly breaking up, she abandoned
 herself to piteous lamentations.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070017"/>It was already none before they descried any one on the shore or
 elsewhere to whom they could make appeal for help; but shortly
 after none it so chanced that a gentleman, Pericone da Visalgo by
 name, being on his return from one of his estates, passed that way
 with some mounted servants. Catching sight of the ship, he apprehended
 the circumstances at a glance, and bade one of his servants
 try to get aboard her, and let him know the result. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070018"/>The servant
 with some difficulty succeeded in boarding the vessel, and found the
 gentle lady with her few companions ensconced under shelter of the
 prow, and shrinking timidly from observation. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070019"/>At the first sight of
 him they wept, and again and again implored him to have pity on
 them; but finding that he did not understand them, nor they him,
 they sought by gestures to make him apprehend their forlorn
 condition.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070020"/>With these tidings the servant, after making such survey of the
 ship as he could, returned to Pericone, who forthwith caused the
 ladies, and all articles of value which were in the ship and could be
 removed, to be brought off her, and took them with him to one of
 his castles. The ladies' powers were soon in a measure restored by
 food and rest, and by the honour which was paid to <persName>Alatiel</persName>, and
 <persName>Alatiel</persName> alone by all the rest, as well as by the richness of her dress,
 Pericone perceived that she must be some great lady. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070021"/>Nor, though
 she was still pale, and her person bore evident marks of the sea's
 rough usage, did he fail to note that it was cast in a mould of
 extraordinary
 beauty. Wherefore his mind was soon made up that, if she
 lacked a husband, he would take her to wife, and that, if he could
 not have her to wife, then he would make her his mistress. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070022"/>So
 this ardent lover, who was a man of powerful frame and haughty
 mien, devoted himself for several days to the service of the
 lady with excellent effect, for the lady completely recovered her
 strength and spirits, so that her beauty far exceeded Pericone's most
 sanguine conjectures. Great therefore beyond measure was his
 sorrow that he understood not her speech, nor she his, so that neither
 could know who the other was; but being inordinately enamoured of
 her beauty, he sought by such mute blandishments as he could devise
 to declare his love, and bring her of her own accord to gratify his
 <pb n="121"/>desire. All in vain, however; she repulsed his advances point blank;
 whereby his passion only grew the stronger. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070023"/>So some days passed;
 and the lady perceiving Pericone's constancy, and bethinking her that
 sooner or later she must yield either to force or to love, and gratify his
 passion, and judging by what she observed of the customs of the people
 that she was amongst Christians, and in a part where, were she able
 to speak their language, she would gain little by making herself
 known, determined with a lofty courage to stand firm and immovable
 in this extremity of her misfortunes. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070024"/>Wherefore she bade the
 three women, who were all that were left to her, on no account to let
 any know who they were, unless they were so circumstanced that
 they might safely count on assistance in effecting their escape: she
 also exhorted them most earnestly to preserve their chastity, averring
 that she was firmly resolved that none but her husband should enjoy
 her. The women heartily assented, and promised that her injunctions
 should be obeyed to the utmost of their power.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070025"/>Day by day Pericone's passion waxed more ardent, being fomented
 by the proximity and contrariety of its object. Wherefore seeing
 that blandishment availed nothing, he was minded to have recourse to
 wiles and stratagems, and in the last resort to force. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070026"/>The lady,
 debarred by her law from the use of wine, found it, perhaps, on that
 account all the more palatable; which Pericone observing determined
 to enlist Bacchus in the service of Venus. So, ignoring her
 coyness, he provided one evening a supper, which was ordered with
 all possible pomp and beauty, and graced by the presence of the lady.
 No lack was there of incentives to hilarity; and Pericone directed
 the servant who waited on <persName>Alatiel</persName> to ply her with divers sorts of
 blended wines; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070027"/>which command the man faithfully executed. She,
 suspecting nothing, and seduced by the delicious flavour of the
 liquor, drank somewhat more freely than was seemly, and forgetting
 her past woes, became frolicsome, and incited by some women who
 trod some measures in the <placeName>Majorca</placeName>n style, she shewed the company
 how they footed it in <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070028"/>This novel demeanour was by no
 means lost on Pericone, who saw in it a good omen of his speedy
 success; so, with profuse relays of food and wine he prolonged the
 supper far into the night.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070029"/>When the guests were at length gone, he attended the lady alone
 to her chamber, where, the heat of the wine overpowering the cold
 <pb n="122"/>counsels of modesty, she made no more account of Pericone's presence
 than if he had been one of her women, and forthwith undressed and
 went to bed. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070030"/>Pericone was not slow to follow her, and as soon as
 the light was out lay down by her side, and taking her in his arms,
 without the least demur on her part, began to solace himself with her
 after the manner of lovers; which experience--she knew not till then
 with what horn men butt--caused her to repent that she had not
 yielded to his blandishments; nor did she thereafter wait to be
 invited to such nights of delight, but many a time declared her readiness,
 not by words, for she had none to convey her meaning, but by
 gestures.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070031"/>But this great felicity which she now shared with Pericone was
 not to last: for not content with making her, instead of the consort
 of a king, the mistress of a castellan, Fortune had now in store for her
 a harsher experience, though of an amorous character. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070032"/>Pericone had
 a brother, twenty-five years of age, fair and fresh as a rose, his name
 <persName>Marato</persName>. On sight of <persName>Alatiel</persName><persName>Marato</persName> had been mightily taken with
 her; he inferred from her bearing that he stood high in her good
 graces; he believed that nothing stood between him and the gratification
 of his passion but the jealous vigilance with which Pericone
 guarded her. So musing, he hit upon a ruthless expedient, which
 had effect in action as hasty as heinous.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070033"/>It so chanced that there then lay in the port of the city a ship,
 commanded by two Genoese, bound with a cargo of merchandise for
 Klarenza in the <placeName>Morea</placeName>: her sails were already hoist; and she tarried
 only for a favourable breeze. <persName>Marato</persName> approached the masters and
 arranged with them to take himself and the lady aboard on the
 following night. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070034"/>This done he concerted further action with some
 of his most trusty friends, who readily lent him their aid to carry his
 design into execution. So on the following evening towards nightfall,
 the conspirators stole unobserved into Pericone's house, which
 was entirely unguarded, and there hid themselves, as pre-arranged.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070035"/>Then, as the night wore on, <persName>Marato</persName> shewed them where Pericone
 and the lady slept, and they entered the room, and slew Pericone.
 The lady thus rudely roused wept; but silencing her by menaces of
 death they carried her off with the best part of Pericone's treasure,
 and hied them unobserved to the coast, where <persName>Marato</persName> parted from his
 companions, and forthwith took the lady aboard the ship. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070036"/>The wind
 <pb n="123"/>was now fair and fresh, the mariners spread the canvas, and the vessel
 sped on her course.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070037"/>This new misadventure, following so hard upon the former, caused
 the lady no small chagrin; but <persName>Marato</persName>, with the aid of the good St.
 Crescent-in-hand that God has given us, found means to afford her
 such consolation that she was already grown so familiar with him as
 entirely to forget Pericone, when Fortune, not content with her
 former caprices, added a new dispensation of woe; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070038"/>for what with
 the beauty of her person, which, as we have often said, was extraordinary,
 and the exquisite charm of her manners, the two young
 men, who commanded the ship, fell so desperately in love with her
 that they thought of nothing but how they might best serve and
 please her, so only that <persName>Marato</persName> should not discover the reason of their
 assiduous attentions. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070039"/>And neither being ignorant of the other's love,
 they held secret counsel together, and resolved to make conquest of
 the lady on joint account: as if love admitted of being held in partnership
 like merchandise or money. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070040"/>Which design being thwarted
 by the jealousy with which <persName>Alatiel</persName> was guarded by <persName>Marato</persName>, they
 chose a day and hour, when the ship was speeding amain under canvas,
 and <persName>Marato</persName> was on the poop looking out over the sea and quite off
 his guard; and going stealthily up behind him, they suddenly laid
 hands on him, and threw him into the sea, and were already more
 than a mile on their course before any perceived that <persName>Marato</persName> was
 overboard. Which when the lady learned, and knew that he was
 irretrievably lost, she relapsed into her former plaintive mood. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070041"/>But
 the twain were forthwith by her side with soft speeches and profuse
 promises, which, however ill she understood them, were not altogether
 inapt to allay a grief which had in it more of concern for her own
 hapless self than of sorrow for her lost lover. So, in course of time,
 the lady beginning visibly to recover heart, they began privily to
 debate which of them should first take her to bed with him; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070042"/>and
 neither being willing to give way to the other, and no compromise
 being discoverable, high words passed between them, and the dispute
 grew so hot, that they both waxed very wroth, drew their knives, and
 rushed madly at one another, and before they could be parted by their
 men, several stabs had been given and received on either side, whereby
 the one fell dead on the spot, and the other was severely wounded in
 divers parts of the body. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070043"/>The lady was much disconcerted to find
 <pb n="124"/>herself thus alone with none to afford her either succour or counsel,
 and was mightily afraid lest the wrath of the kinsfolk and friends of
 the twain should vent itself upon her. From this mortal peril she
 was, however, delivered by the intercessions of the wounded man and
 their speedy arrival at Klarenza.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070044"/>As there she tarried at the same inn with her wounded lover, the
 fame of her great beauty was speedily bruited abroad, and reached the
 ears of the Prince of the <placeName>Morea</placeName>, who was then staying there. The
 Prince was curious to see her, and having so done, pronounced her even
 more beautiful than rumour had reported her; nay, he fell in love
 with her in such a degree that he could think of nought else; and
 having heard in what guise she had come thither, he deemed that he
 might have her. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070045"/>While he was casting about how to compass his
 end, the kinsfolk of the wounded man, being apprised of the fact,
 forthwith sent her to him to the boundless delight, as well of the lady,
 who saw therein her deliverance from a great peril, as of the Prince.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070046"/>The royal bearing, which enhanced the lady's charms, did not escape
 the Prince, who, being unable to discover her true rank, set her down
 as at any rate of noble lineage; wherefore he loved her as much again
 as before, and shewed her no small honour, treating her not as his
 mistress but as his wife. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070047"/>So the lady, contrasting her present happy
 estate with her past woes, was comforted; and, as her gaiety revived,
 her beauty waxed in such a degree that all the <placeName>Morea</placeName> talked of it and
 of little else: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070048"/>insomuch that the Prince's friend and kinsman, the
 young, handsome and gallant Duke of Athens, was smitten with a
 desire to see her, and taking occasion to pay the Prince a visit, as he
 was now and again wont to do, came to Klarenza with a goodly
 company of honourable gentlemen. The Prince received him with
 all distinction and made him heartily welcome, but did not at first
 shew him the lady. By and by, however, their conversation began
 to turn upon her and her charms, and the Duke asked if she were
 really so marvellous a creature as folk said. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070049"/>The Prince replied:
 <q>Nay, but even more so; and thereof thou shalt have better assurance
 than my words, to wit, the witness of thine own eyes.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070050"/>So, without
 delay, for the Duke was now all impatience, they waited on the lady,
 who was prepared for their visit, and received them very courteously
 and graciously. They seated her between them, and being debarred
 from the pleasure of conversing with her, for of their speech she
 <pb n="125"/>understood little or nothing, they both, and especially the Duke, who
 was scarce able to believe that she was of mortal mould, gazed upon
 her in mute admiration; whereby the Duke, cheating himself with
 the idea that he was but gratifying his curiosity, drank with his eyes,
 unawares, deep draughts of the poisoned chalice of love, and, to his
 own lamentable hurt, fell a prey to a most ardent passion. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070051"/>His first
 thought, when they had left her, and he had time for reflection, was
 that the Prince was the luckiest man in the world to have a creature so
 fair to solace him; and swayed by his passion, his mind soon inclined
 to divers other and less honourable meditations, whereof the issue was
 that, come what might, he would despoil the Prince of his felicity, and,
 if possible, make it his own. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070052"/>This resolution was no sooner taken than,
 being of a hasty temperament, he cast to the winds all considerations
 of honour and justice, and studied only how to compass his end by
 craft. So, one day, as the first step towards the accomplishment of his
 evil purpose, he arranged with the Prince's most trusted chamberlain,
 one <persName>Ciuriaci</persName>, that his horses and all other his personal effects should,
 with the utmost secrecy, be got ready against a possible sudden departure:
 and then at nightfall, attended by a single comrade (both
 carrying arms), he was privily admitted by <persName>Ciuriaci</persName> into the Prince's
 chamber. It was a hot night, and the Prince had risen without
 disturbing the lady, and was standing bare to the skin at an open
 window fronting the sea, to enjoy a light breeze that blew thence.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070053"/>So, by preconcert with his comrade, the Duke stole up to the window,
 and in a trice ran the Prince through the body, and caught him up,
 and threw him out of the window. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070054"/>The palace was close by the
 sea, but at a considerable altitude above it, and the window, through
 which the Prince's body was thrown, looked over some houses, which,
 being sapped by the sea, had become ruinous, and were rarely or
 never visited by a soul; whereby, as the Duke had foreseen, the fall
 of the Prince's body passed, as indeed it could not but pass, unobserved.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070055"/>Thereupon the Duke's accomplice whipped out a halter,
 which he had brought with him for the purpose, and, making as if he
 were but in play, threw it round <persName>Ciuriaci</persName>'s neck, drew it so tight that
 he could not utter a sound, and then, with the Duke's aid, strangled
 him, and sent him after his master. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070056"/>All this was accomplished, as the
 Duke knew full well, without awakening any in the palace, not even
 the lady, whom he now approached with a light, and holding it
 <pb n="126"/>over the bed gently uncovered her person, as she lay fast asleep, and
 surveyed her from head to foot to his no small satisfaction; for fair
 as she had seemed to him dressed, he found her unadorned charms
 incomparably greater. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070057"/>As he gazed, his passion waxed beyond
 measure, and, reckless of his recent crime, and of the blood which
 still stained his hands, he got forthwith into the bed; and she, being
 too sound asleep to distinguish between him and the Prince, suffered
 him to lie with her.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070058"/>But, boundless as was his delight, it brooked no long continuance;
 so, rising, he called to him some of his comrades, by whom he had
 the lady secured in such manner that she could utter no sound, and
 borne out of the palace by the same secret door by which he had
 gained entrance; he then set her on horseback and in dead silence
 put his troop in motion, taking the road to Athens. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070059"/>He did not,
 however, venture to take the lady to Athens, where she would have
 encountered his Duchess--for he was married--but lodged her in a
 very beautiful villa which he had hard by the city overlooking the
 sea, where, most forlorn of ladies, she lived secluded, but with no lack
 of meet and respectful service.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070060"/>On the following morning the Prince's courtiers awaited his
      rising until none, but perceiving no sign of it, opened the doors,
      which had not been secured, and entered his bedroom. Finding it
      vacant, they supposed that the Prince was gone off privily somewhere
      to have a few days of unbroken delight with his fair lady; and so
      they gave themselves no further trouble. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070061"/>But the next day it so
      chanced that an idiot, roaming about the ruins where lay the corpses
      of the Prince and <persName>Ciuriaci</persName>, drew the latter out by the halter and
      went off dragging it after him. The corpse was soon recognised by
      not a few, who, at first struck dumb with amazement, soon recovered
      sense enough to cajole the idiot into retracing his steps and shewing
      them the spot where he had found it; and having thus, to the
      immeasurable grief of all the citizens, discovered the Prince's body,
      they buried it with all honour. Needless to say that no pains were
      spared to trace the perpetrators of so heinous a crime, and that the
      absence and evidently furtive departure of the Duke of Athens
      caused him to be suspected both of the murder and of the abduction
      of the lady. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070062"/>So the citizens were instant with one accord that
      the Prince's brother, whom they chose as his successor, should exact
      <pb n="127"/>the debt of vengeance; and he, having satisfied himself by further
      investigation that their suspicion was well founded, summoned to his
      aid his kinsfolk, friends and divers vassals, and speedily gathered a
      large, powerful and well-equipped army, with intent to make war
      upon the Duke of Athens. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070063"/>The Duke, being informed of his
      movements, made ready likewise to defend himself with all his
      power; nor had he any lack of allies, among whom the Emperor of
      <placeName>Constantinople</placeName> sent his son, Constantine, and his nephew, Manuel,
      with a great and goodly force. The two young men were honourably
      received by the Duke, and still more so by the Duchess, who
      was Constantine's sister.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070064"/>Day by day war grew more imminent; and at last the Duchess
      took occasion to call Constantine and Manuel into her private
      chamber, and with many tears told them the whole story at large,
      explaining the <!--(i)-->casus belli<!--(/i)-->, dilating on the indignity which she
      suffered
      at the hands of the Duke, if, as was believed, he really kept a mistress
      in secret, and beseeching them in most piteous accents to do the best
      they could to devise some expedient whereby the Duke's honour
      might be cleared, and her own peace of mind assured. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070065"/>The young
      men knew exactly how matters stood; and so, without wearying the
      Duchess with many questions, they did their best to console her, and
      succeeded in raising her hopes. Before taking their leave they
      learned from her where the lady was, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070066"/>whose marvellous beauty they
      had heard lauded so often; and being eager to see her, they besought
      the Duke to afford them an opportunity. Forgetful of what a like
      complaisance had cost the Prince, he consented, and next morning
      brought them to the villa where the lady lived, and with her and a
      few of his boon companions regaled them with a lordly breakfast,
      which was served in a most lovely garden. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070067"/>Constantine had no
      sooner seated himself and surveyed the lady, than he was lost in
      admiration, inly affirming that he had never seen so beautiful a
      creature, and that for such a prize the Duke, or any other man,
      might well be pardoned treachery or any other crime: he scanned
      her again and again, and ever with more and more admiration; whereby
      it fared with him even as it had fared with the Duke. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070068"/>He went
      away hotly in love with her, and dismissing all thought of the war,
      cast about for some method by which, without betraying his passion to
      any, he might devise some means of wresting the lady from the Duke.</p><pb n="128"/><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070069"/>As he thus burned and brooded, the Prince drew dangerously
      near the Duke's dominions; wherefore order was given for an
      advance, and the Duke, with Constantine and the rest, marshalled
      his forces and led them forth from Athens to bar the Prince's passage
      of the frontier at certain points. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070070"/>Some days thus passed, during
      which Constantine, whose mind and soul were entirely absorbed by
      his passion for the lady, bethought him, that, as the Duke was no
      longer in her neighbourhood, he might readily compass his end. He
      therefore feigned to be seriously unwell, and, having by this pretext
      obtained the Duke's leave, he ceded his command to Manuel, and
      returned to his sister at Athens. He had not been there many days
      before the Duchess recurred to the dishonour which the Duke did
      her by keeping the lady; whereupon he said that of that, if she
      approved, he would certainly relieve her by seeing that the lady was
      removed from the villa to some distant place. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070071"/>The Duchess,
      supposing that Constantine was prompted not by jealousy of the
      Duke but by jealousy for her honour, gave her hearty consent to his
      plan, provided he so contrived that the Duke should never know that
      she had been privy to it; on which point Constantine gave her ample
      assurance. So, being authorised by the Duchess to act as he might
      deem best, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070072"/>he secretly equipped a light bark and manned her with
      some of his men, to whom he confided his plan, bidding them lie to
      off the garden of the lady's villa; and so, having sent the bark
      forward, he hied him with other of his men to the villa. He gained
      ready admission of the servants, and was made heartily welcome by
      the lady, who, at his desire, attended by some of her servants, walked
      with him and some of his comrades in the garden. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070073"/>By and by,
      feigning that he had a message for her from the Duke, he drew her
      aside towards a gate that led down to the sea, and which one of his
      confederates had already opened. A concerted signal brought the
      bark alongside, and to seize the lady and set her aboard the bark was
      but the work of an instant. Her retinue hung back as they heard
      Constantine menace with death whoso but stirred or spoke, and
      suffered him, protesting that what he did was done not to wrong the
      Duke but solely to vindicate his sister's honour, to embark with his
      men. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070074"/>The lady wept, of course, but Constantine was at her side,
      the rowers gave way, and the bark, speeding like a thing of life over
      the waves, made <placeName>Egina</placeName> shortly after dawn. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070075"/>There Constantine and
      <pb n="129"/>the lady landed, she still lamenting her fatal beauty, and took a
      little
      rest and pleasure. Then, re-embarking, they continued their voyage,
      and in the course of a few days reached <placeName>Chios</placeName>, which Constantine,
      fearing paternal censure, and that he might be deprived of his fair
      booty, deemed a safe place of sojourn. So, after some days of repose
      the lady ceased to bewail her harsh destiny, and suffering Constantine
      to console her as his predecessors had done, began once more to enjoy
      the good gifts which Fortune sent her.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070076"/>Now while they thus dallied, Osbech, King of the Turks, who
      was perennially at war with the Emperor, came by chance to
      <placeName>Smyrna</placeName>; and there learning that Constantine was wantoning in
      careless ease at <placeName>Chios</placeName> with a lady of whom he had made prize, he
      made a descent by night upon the island with an armed flotilla.
      Landing his men in dead silence, he made captives of not a few of
      the Chians whom he surprised in their beds; others, who took the
      alarm and rushed to arms, he slew; and having wasted the whole
      island with fire, he shipped the booty and the prisoners, and sailed
      back to <placeName>Smyrna</placeName>. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070077"/>As there he overhauled the booty, he lit upon the
      fair lady, and knew her for the same that had been taken in bed
      and fast asleep with Constantine: whereat, being a young man,
      he was delighted beyond measure, and made her his wife out of
      hand with all due form and ceremony. And so for several months
      he enjoyed her.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070078"/>Now there had been for some time and still was a treaty pending
      between the Emperor and <persName>Basano</persName>, King of <placeName>Cappadocia</placeName>, whereby
      <persName>Basano</persName> with his forces was to fall on Osbech on one side while the
      Emperor attacked him on the other. Some demands made by
      <persName>Basano</persName>, which the Emperor deemed unreasonable, had so far retarded
      the conclusion of the treaty; but no sooner had the Emperor learned
      the fate of his son than, distraught with grief, he forthwith conceded
      the King of <placeName>Cappadocia</placeName>'s demands, and was instant with him to fall
      at once upon Osbech while he made ready to attack him on the other
      side. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070079"/>Getting wind of the Emperor's design, Osbech collected his
      forces, and, lest he should be caught and crushed between the convergent
      armies of two most mighty potentates, advanced against the
      King of <placeName>Cappadocia</placeName>. The fair lady he left at <placeName>Smyrna</placeName> in the care of
      a faithful dependant and friend, and after a while joined battle with
      the King of <placeName>Cappadocia</placeName>, in which battle he was slain, and his army
      <pb n="130"/>defeated and dispersed. Wherefore <persName>Basano</persName> with his victorious host
      advanced, carrying everything before him, upon <placeName>Smyrna</placeName>, and receiving
      everywhere the submission due to a conqueror.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070080"/>Meanwhile Osbech's dependant, by name <persName>Antioco</persName>, who had
      charge of the fair lady, was so smitten with her charms that, albeit
      he was somewhat advanced in years, he broke faith with his friend
      and lord, and allowed himself to become enamoured of her. He had
      the advantage of knowing her language, which counted for much with
      one who for some years had been, as it were, compelled to live the
      life of a deaf mute, finding none whom she could understand or by
      whom she might be understood; and goaded by passion, he in the
      course of a few days established such a degree of intimacy with her
      that in no long time it passed from friendship into love, so that their
      lord, far away amid the clash of arms and the tumult of the battle,
      was forgotten, and marvellous pleasure had they of one another
      between the sheets.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070081"/>However, news came at last of Osbech's defeat and death, and
      the victorious and unchecked advance of <persName>Basano</persName>, whose advent they
      were by no means minded to await. Wherefore, taking with them
      the best part of the treasure that Osbech had left there, they hied
      them with all possible secrecy to <placeName>Rhodes</placeName>. There they had not along
      abode before <persName>Antioco</persName> fell ill of a mortal disease. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070082"/>He had then with
      him a Cypriote merchant, an intimate and very dear friend, to whom,
      as he felt his end approach, he resolved to leave all that he possessed,
      including his dear lady. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070083"/>So, when he felt death imminent, he called
      them to him and said: <q>'Tis now quite evident to me that my life
	is fast ebbing away; and sorely do I regret it, for never had I so much
	pleasure of life as now. Well content indeed I am in one respect,
	in that, as die I must, I at least die in the arms of the two persons
	whom I love more than any other in the world, to wit, in thine
	arms, dearest friend, and those of this lady, whom, since I have
	known her, I have loved more than myself. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070084"/>But yet 'tis grievous to
	me to know that I must leave her here in a strange land with none
	to afford her either protection or counsel; and but that I leave her
	with thee, who, I doubt not, wilt have for my sake no less care of her
	than thou wouldst have had of me, 'twould grieve me still more;
	wherefore with all my heart and soul I pray thee, that, if I die, thou
	take her with all else that belongs to me into thy charge, and so
	<pb n="131"/>acquit thyself of thy trust as thou mayst deem conducive to
	the peace of my soul. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070085"/>And of thee, dearest lady, I entreat one
	favour, that I be not forgotten of thee, after my death, so that there
	whither I go it may still be my boast to be beloved here of the
	most beautiful lady that nature ever formed. Let me but die
	with these two hopes assured, and without doubt I shall depart in
	peace.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070086"/>Both the merchant and the lady wept to hear him thus speak,
      and, when he had done, comforted him, and promised faithfully, in the
      event of his death, to do even as he besought them. He died almost
      immediately afterwards, and was honourably buried by them. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070087"/>A
      few days sufficed the merchant to wind up all his affairs in <placeName>Rhodes</placeName>;
      and being minded to return to <placeName>Cyprus</placeName> aboard a Catalan boat that was
      there, he asked the fair lady what she purposed to do if he went back
      to <placeName>Cyprus</placeName>. The lady answered, that, if it were agreeable to him, she
      would gladly accompany him, hoping that for love of <persName>Antioco</persName> he
      would treat and regard her as his sister. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070088"/>The merchant replied that
      it would afford him all the pleasure in the world; and, to protect her
      from insult until their arrival in <placeName>Cyprus</placeName>, he gave her out as his wife,
      and, suiting action to word, slept with her on the boat in an alcove
      in a little cabin in the poop. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070089"/>Whereby that happened which on
      neither side was intended when they left <placeName>Rhodes</placeName>, to wit, that the
      darkness and the comfort and the warmth of the bed, forces of no
      mean efficacy, did so prevail with them that dead <persName>Antioco</persName> was forgotten
      alike as lover and as friend, and by a common impulse they
      began to wanton together, insomuch that before they were arrived
      at <placeName>Baffa</placeName>, where the Cypriote resided, they were indeed man and wife.
      At <placeName>Baffa</placeName> the lady tarried with the merchant a good while, 
      <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070090"/>during
      which it so befell that a gentleman, Antigono by name, a man of
      ripe age and riper wisdom but no great wealth, being one that had
      had vast and various experience of affairs in the service of the King
      of <placeName>Cyprus</placeName> but had found fortune adverse to him, came to <placeName>Baffa</placeName> on
      business; and <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070091"/>passing one day by the house where the fair lady was
      then living by herself, for the Cypriote merchant was gone to <placeName>Armenia</placeName>
      with some of his wares, he chanced to catch sight of the lady at
      one of the windows, and, being struck by her extraordinary beauty,
      regarded her attentively, and began to have some vague recollection
      of having seen her before, but could by no means remember where.
      <pb n="132"/><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070092"/>The fair lady, however, so long the sport of Fortune, but now nearing
      the term of her woes, no sooner saw Antigono than she remembered
      to have seen him in her father's service, and in no mean
      capacity, at <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>. Wherefore she forthwith sent for him,
      hoping that by his counsel she might elude her merchant and be
      reinstated in her true character and dignity of princess. 
      <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070093"/>When he
      presented himself, she asked him with some embarrassment whether
      he were, as she took him to be, Antigono of <placeName>Famagosta</placeName>. 
      <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070094"/>He answered
      in the affirmative, adding: <q>And of you, madam, I have a sort of
	recollection, though I cannot say where I have seen you; wherefore,
	so it irk you not, bring, I pray you, yourself to my remembrance.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070095"/>Satisfied that it was Antigono himself, the lady in a flood of tears threw
      herself upon him to his no small amazement, and embraced his neck:
      then, after a little while, she asked him whether he had never seen
      her in <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>. The question awakened Antigono's memory; he
      at once recognised <persName>Alatiel</persName>, the Soldan's daughter, whom he had thought
      to have been drowned at sea, and would have paid her due homage;
      but she would not suffer it, and bade him be seated with her for a
      while. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070096"/>Being seated, he respectfully asked her, how, and when and
      whence she had come thither, seeing that all <placeName>Egypt</placeName> believed for
      certain that she had been drowned at sea some years before. 
      <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070097"/><q>And
	would that so it had been,</q> said the lady, <q>rather than I should
	have led the life that I have led; and so doubtless will my father
	say, if he shall ever come to know of it.</q> And so saying, she
      burst into such a flood of tears that 'twas a wonder to see. 
      <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070098"/>Wherefore
      <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070099"/>Antigono said to her: <q>Nay but, madam, be not distressed
	before the occasion arises. I pray you, tell me the story of your
	adventures, and what has been the tenor of your life; perchance
	'twill prove to be no such matter but, God helping us, we may set it
	all straight.</q><q>Antigono,</q> said the fair lady, <q>when I saw thee,
	'twas as if I saw my father, and 'twas the tender love by which I
	am holden to him that prompted me to make myself known to thee,
	though I might have kept my secret; and few indeed there are,
	whom to have met would have afforded me such pleasure as this
	which I have in meeting and recognising thee before all others;
	wherefore I will now make known to thee as to a father that which
	in my evil fortune I have ever kept close. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070100"/>If, when thou hast heard
	my story, thou seest any means whereby I may be reinstated in my
	<pb n="133"/>
	former honour, I pray thee use it. If not, disclose to none that thou
	hast seen me or heard aught of me.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070101"/>Then, weeping between every word, she told him her whole
      story from the day of the shipwreck at <placeName>Majorca</placeName> to that hour.
      Antigono wept in sympathy, and then said: <q>Madam, as throughout
	this train of misfortunes you have happily escaped recognition, I
	undertake to restore you to your father in such sort that you shall be
	dearer to him than ever before, and be afterwards married to the King
	of Algarve. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070102"/><q>How?</q> she asked. Whereupon he explained to her
	in detail how he meant to proceed; and, lest delay should give
	occasion to another to interfere, he went back at once to <placeName>Famagosta</placeName>,
	and having obtained audience of the King, thus he spoke: <q>Sire,
	  so please you, you have it in your power at little cost to yourself to
	  do a thing, which will at once redound most signally to your honour
	  and confer a great boon on me, who have grown poor in your
	  service.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070103"/><q>How?</q> asked the King. Then said Antigono: 
	<q>At
	  <placeName>Baffa</placeName> is of late arrived a fair damsel, daughter of the Soldan, long
	  thought to be drowned, who to preserve her chastity has suffered
	  long and severe hardship. She is now reduced to poverty, and is
	  desirous of returning to her father. If you should be pleased to send
	  her back to him under my escort, your honour and my interest would
	  be served in high and equal measure; nor do I think that such a
	  service would ever be forgotten by the Soldan.</q></q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070104"/>With true royal generosity the King forthwith signified his
      approval, and had <persName>Alatiel</persName> brought under honourable escort to <placeName>Famagosta</placeName>,
      where, attended by his Queen, he received her with every
      circumstance of festal pomp and courtly magnificence. Schooled by
      Antigono, she gave the King and Queen such a version of her
      adventures as satisfied their inquiries in every particular. 
      <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070105"/>So, after a
      few days, the King sent her back to the Soldan under escort of
      Antigono, attended by a goodly company of honourable men and
      women; and of the cheer which the Soldan made her, and not her
      only but Antigono and all his company, it boots not to ask. When she
      was somewhat rested, the Soldan inquired how it was that she was
      yet alive, and where she had been so long without letting him know
      how it fared with her. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070106"/>Whereupon the lady, who had got Antigono's
      lesson by heart, answered thus: <q>My father, 'twas perhaps the
	twentieth night after my departure from you when our ship parted her
	<pb n="134"/>timbers in a terrible storm and went ashore nigh a place called
	<placeName>Aguamorta</placeName>, away there in the West: what was the fate of the men
	that were aboard our ship I know not, nor knew I ever; 
	<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070107"/>I remember
	only, that, when day came, and I returned, as it were, from death to
	life, the wreck, having been sighted, was boarded by folk from all the
	country-side, intent on plunder; and I and two of my women were
	taken ashore, where the women were forthwith parted from me by
	the young men, nor did I ever learn their fate. Now hear my own.
	<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070108"/>Struggling might and main, I was seized by two young men, who
	dragged me, weeping bitterly, by the hair of the head, towards a
	great forest; but, on sight of four men who were then passing that
	way on horseback, they forthwith loosed me and took to flight.
	<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070109"/>Whereupon the four men, who struck me as persons of great
	authority, ran up to me; and much they questioned me, and much I
	said to them; but neither did they understand me, nor I them. So,
	after long time conferring together, they set me on one of their
	horses and brought me to a house, where dwelt a community of
	ladies, religious according to their law; and what the men may have
	said I know not, but there I was kindly received and ever honourably
	entreated by all; and with them I did afterwards most reverentially
	pay my devotions to St. Crescent-in-Hollow, who is held in great
	honour by the women of that country. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070110"/>When I had been some
	time with them, and had learned something of their language, they
	asked me who and whence I was: whereto I, knowing that I was in
	a convent, and fearing to be cast out as a foe to their law if I told the
	truth, answered that I was the daughter of a great gentleman of
	<placeName>Cyprus</placeName>, who had intended to marry me to a gentleman of <placeName>Crete</placeName>;
	but that on the voyage we had been driven out of our course and
	wrecked at <placeName>Aguamorta</placeName>. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070111"/>And so I continued, as occasion required,
	observing their usages with much assiduity, lest worse should befall
	me; but being one day asked by their superior, whom they call
 abbess, whether I was minded to go back to <placeName>Cyprus</placeName>, I answered that
	there was nought that I desired so much. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070112"/>However, so solicitous for
	my honour was the abbess, that there was none going to <placeName>Cyprus</placeName> to
	whom she would entrust me, until, two months or so ago, there
	arrived some worthy men from <placeName>France</placeName>, of whom one was a kinsman
	of the abbess, with their wives. They were on their way to visit the
	sepulchre where He whom they hold to be God was buried after He
	<pb n="135"/>had suffered death at the hands of the Jews; and the abbess, learning
	their destination, prayed them to take charge of me, and restore me
	to my father in <placeName>Cyprus</placeName>. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070113"/>With what cheer, with what honour, these
	gentlemen and their wives entertained me, 'twere long to tell. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070114"/>But,
	in brief, we embarked, and in the course of a few days arrived at
	<placeName>Baffa</placeName>, where it was so ordered by the providence of God, who perchance
	took pity on me, that in the very hour of our disembarkation
	I, not knowing a soul and being at a loss how to answer the gentlemen,
	who would fain have discharged the trust laid upon them by
	the reverend abbess and restored me to my father, fell in, on the
	shore, with Antigono, whom I forthwith called, and in our language,
	that I might be understood neither of the gentlemen nor of their
	wives, bade him acknowledge me as his daughter. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070115"/>He understood
	my case at once, made much of me, and to the utmost of his
	slender power honourably requited the gentlemen. He then brought
	me to the King of <placeName>Cyprus</placeName>, who accorded me welcome there and
	conduct hither so honourable as words of mine can never describe. It
	aught remains to tell, you may best learn it from the lips of Antigono,
	who has often heard my story.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070116"/>Then Antigono, addressing the Soldan, said: <q>Sire, what she
 has told you accords with what she has often told me, and with
 what I have learned from the gentlemen and ladies who accompanied
 her. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070117"/>One thing, however, she has omitted, because, I suppose, it
 hardly becomes her to tell it; to wit, all that the gentlemen and
 ladies, who accompanied her, said of the virtuous and gracious and
 noble life which she led with the devout ladies, and of the tears and
 wailings of both the ladies and the gentlemen, when they parted
 with her to me. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070118"/>But were I to essay to repeat all that they said to
 me, the day that now is, and the night that is to follow, were all too
 short: suffice it to say so much as this, that, by what I gathered
 from their words and have been able to see for myself, you may make
 it your boast, that among all the daughters of all your peers that
 wear the crown none can be matched with yours for virtue and true
 worth.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070119"/>By all which the Soldan was so overjoyed that 'twas a wonder to
 see. Again and again he made supplication to God, that of His
 grace power might be vouchsafed him adequately to recompense all
 who had done honour to his daughter, and most especially the King
 <pb n="136"/>of <placeName>Cyprus</placeName>, for the honourable escort under which he had sent her
 thither; for Antigono he provided a magnificent guerdon, and some
 days later gave him his <!--(i)-->congè<!--(/i)--> to return to <placeName>Cyprus</placeName>, at the same
 time
 by a special ambassage conveying to the King his grateful acknowledgments
 of the manner in which he had treated his daughter.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070120"/>Then, being minded that his first intent, to wit, that his daughter
 should be the bride of the King of Algarve, should not be frustrate,
 he wrote to the King, telling him all, and adding that, if he were
 still minded to have her, he might send for her. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02070121"/>The King was
 overjoyed by these tidings, and having sent for her with great pomp,
 gave her on her arrival a hearty welcome. So she, who had lain

 Franks to the Germans, the greatest enmity prevailed between the
 two nations, with warfare perpetual and relentless: wherefore,
 deeming that the offensive would be their best defence, the King of
 <placeName>France</placeName> and his son mustered all the forces they could raise from
 their own dominions and those of their kinsmen and allies, and
 arrayed a grand army for the subjugation of their enemies. Before
 <pb n="138"/>they took the field, as they could not leave the realm without a
 governor, they chose for that office Gautier, Count of Antwerp, a
 true knight and sage counsellor, and their very loyal ally and vassal,
 choosing him the rather, because, albeit he was a thorough master of
 the art of war, yet they deemed him less apt to support its hardships
 than for the conduct of affairs of a delicate nature. Him, therefore,
 they set in their place as their vicar-general and regent of the whole
 realm of <placeName>France</placeName>, and having so done, they took the field.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080005"/>Count Gautier ordered his administration wisely and in a regular
 course, discussing all matters with the queen and her daughter-in-law;
 whom, albeit they were left under his charge and jurisdiction,
 he nevertheless treated as his ladies paramount. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080006"/>The Count was
 about forty years of age, and the very mould of manly beauty; in
 bearing as courteous and chivalrous as ever a gentleman might be,
 and withal so debonair and dainty, so feat and trim of person that
 he had not his peer among the gallants of that day. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080007"/>His wife was
 dead, leaving him two children and no more, to wit, a boy and a
 girl, still quite young. Now the King and his son being thus away
 at the war, and the Count frequenting the court of the two said
 ladies, and consulting with them upon affairs of state, it so befell
 that the Prince's lady regarded him with no small favour, being very
 sensible alike of the advantages of his person and the nobility of his
 bearing; whereby she conceived for him a passion which was all the
 more ardent because it was secret. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080008"/>And, as he was without a wife,
 and she was still in the freshness of her youth, she saw not why she
 should not readily be gratified; but supposing that nothing stood in
 the way but her own shamefastness, she resolved to be rid of that,
 and disclose her mind to him without any reserve. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080009"/>So one day,
 when she was alone, she seized her opportunity, and sent for him, as
 if she were desirous to converse with him on indifferent topics. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080010"/>The
 Count, his mind entirely aloof from the lady's purpose, presented
 himself forthwith, and at her invitation sate down by her side on a
 settee. They were quite alone in the room; but the Count had
 twice asked her the reason why she had so honoured him, before,
 overcome by passion, she broke silence, and crimson from brow to
 neck with shame, half sobbing, trembling in every limb, and faltering
 at every word, she thus spoke: 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080011"/><q>Dearest friend and sweet my lord,
 sagacity such as yours cannot but be apt to perceive how great is the
 <pb n="139"/>frailty of men and women, and how, for divers reasons, it varies in
 different persons in such a degree that no just judge would mete
 out the same measure to each indifferently, though the fault were
 apparently the same. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080012"/>Who would not acknowledge that a poor man
 or woman, fain to earn daily bread by the sweat of the brow, is far
 more reprehensible in yielding to the solicitations of love, than a
 rich lady, whose life is lapped in ease and unrestricted luxury? 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080013"/>Not
 a soul, I am persuaded, but would so acknowledge! Wherefore I
 deem that the possession of these boons of fortune should go far
 indeed to acquit the possessor, if she, perchance, indulge an errant
 love; and, for the rest, that, if she have chosen a wise and worthy
 lover, she should be entirely exonerated. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080014"/>And as I think I may
 fairly claim the benefit of both these pleas, and of others beside, to
 wit, my youth and my husband's absence, which naturally incline me
 to love, 'tis meet that I now urge them in your presence in defence
 of my passion; and if they have the weight with you which they
 should have with the wise, I pray you to afford me your help and
 counsel in the matter wherein I shall demand it. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080015"/>I avow that in the
 absence of my husband I have been unable to withstand the promptings
 of the flesh and the power of love, forces of such potency that
 even the strongest men--not to speak of delicate women--have not
 seldom been, nay daily are, overcome by them; and so, living thus,
 as you see me, in ease and luxury, I have allowed the allurements of
 love to draw me on until at last I find myself a prey to passion.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080016"/>Wherein were I discovered, I were, I confess, dishonoured; but
 discovery being avoided, I count the dishonour all but nought.
 Moreover, love has been so gracious to me that not only has he
 spared to blind me in the choice of my lover, but he has even lent me
 his most effective aid, pointing me to one well worthy of the love of
 a lady such as I, even to yourself; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080017"/>whom, if I misread not my
 mind, I deem the most handsome and courteous and debonair, and
 therewithal the sagest cavalier that the realm of <placeName>France</placeName> may shew.
 And as you are without a wife, so may I say that I find myself
 without a husband. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080018"/>Wherefore in return for this great love I bear
 you, deny me not, I pray you, yours; but have pity on my youth,
 which wastes away for you like ice before the fire.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080019"/>These words were followed by such a flood of tears, that, albeit
 she had intended yet further to press her suit, speech failed her; her
 <pb n="140"/>eyes drooped, and, almost swooning with emotion, she let her head
 fall upon the Count's breast. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080020"/>The Count, who was the most loyal
 of knights, began with all severity to chide her mad passion and to
 thrust her from him--for she was now making as if she would throw
 her arms around his neck--and to asseverate with oaths that he
 would rather be hewn in pieces than either commit, or abet another
 in committing such an offence against the honour of his lord; 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080021"/>when
 the lady, catching his drift, and forgetting all her love in a sudden
 frenzy of rage, cried out: <q>So! unknightly knight, is it thus you
 flout my love? Now Heaven forbid, but, as you would be the death
 of me, I either do you to death or drive you from the world!</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080022"/>So
 saying, she dishevelled and tore her hair and rent her garments to
 shreds about her bosom. Which done, she began shrieking at the top
 of her voice: <q>Help! help! The Count of Antwerp threatens to
 violate me!</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080023"/>Whereupon the Count, who knew that a clear conscience
 was no protection against the envy of courtiers, and doubted that
 his innocence would prove scarce a match for the cunning of the
 lady, started to his feet, and hied him with all speed out of the room,
 out of the palace, and back to his own house. Counsel of none he
 sought; but forthwith set his children on horseback, and taking
 horse himself, departed post haste for <placeName>Calais</placeName>. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080024"/>The lady's cries
 brought not a few to her aid, who, observing her plight, not only
 gave entire credence to her story, but improved upon it, alleging that
 the debonair and accomplished Count had long employed all the arts
 of seduction to compass his end. So they rushed in hot haste to the
 Count's house, with intent to arrest him, and not finding him, sacked
 it and razed it to the ground. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080025"/>The news, as glosed and garbled,
 being carried to the King and Prince in the field, they were mightily
 incensed, and offered a great reward for the Count, dead or alive, and
 condemned him and his posterity to perpetual banishment.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080026"/>Meanwhile the Count, sorely troubled that by his flight his
 innocence shewed as guilt, pursued his journey, and concealing his
 identity, and being recognised by none, arrived with his two children
 at <placeName>Calais</placeName>. Thence he forthwith crossed to <placeName>England</placeName>, and, meanly
 clad, fared on for <placeName>London</placeName>, taking care as he went to school his
 children in all that belonged to their new way of life, and especially
 in two main articles: to wit, that they should bear with resignation
 the poverty to which, by no fault of theirs, but solely by one of
 <pb n="141"/>Fortune's caprices, they and he were reduced, and that they should
 be most sedulously on their guard to betray to none, as they valued
 their lives, whence they were, or who their father was. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080027"/>The son,
 Louis by name, was perhaps nine, and the daughter, Violante, perhaps
 seven years of age. For years so tender they proved apt pupils, and
 afterwards shewed by their conduct that they had well learned their
 father's lesson. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080028"/>He deemed it expedient to change their names, and
 accordingly called the boy Perrot and the girl Jeannette. So, meanly
 clad, the Count and his two children arrived at <placeName>London</placeName>, and there
 made shift to get a living by going about soliciting alms in the guise
 of French mendicants.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080029"/>Now, as for this purpose they waited one morning outside a
      church, it so befell that a great lady, the wife of one of the marshals
      of the King of <placeName>England</placeName>, observed them, as she left the church, asking
      alms, and demanded of the Count whence he was, and whether
      the children were his. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080030"/>He answered that he was from <placeName>Picardy</placeName>, that
      the children were his, and that he had been fain to leave <placeName>Picardy</placeName> by
      reason of the misconduct of their reprobate elder brother. 
      <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080031"/>The lady
      looked at the girl, who being fair, and of gentle and winning mien
      and manners, found much favour in her eyes. So the kind-hearted
      lady said to the Count: <q>My good man, if thou art willing to
	leave thy little daughter with me, I like her looks so well that I will
	gladly take her; and if she grow up a good woman, I will see that
	she is suitably married when the right time comes.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080032"/>The Count
      was much gratified by the proposal, which he forthwith accepted,
      and parted with the girl, charging the lady with tears to take every
      care of her.</p><!--**probably**--><p>Having thus placed the girl with one in whom he felt sure that he
 might trust, he determined to tarry no longer in <placeName>London</placeName>; wherefore,
 taking Perrot with him and begging as he went, he made his way
 to <placeName>Wales</placeName>, not without great suffering, being unused to go afoot.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080033"/>Now in <placeName>Wales</placeName> another of the King's marshals had his court, maintaining
 great state and a large number of retainers; to which court
 the Count and his son frequently repaired, there to get food; 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080034"/>and
 there Perrot, finding the marshal's son and other gentlemen's sons
 vying with one another in boyish exercises, as running and leaping,
 little by little joined their company, and shewed himself a match or
 more for them all in all their contests. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080035"/>The marshal's attention
 <pb n="142"/>being thus drawn to him, he was well pleased with the boy's mien
 and bearing, and asked who he was. He was told that he was the
 son of a poor man who sometimes came there to solicit alms.
 Whereupon he asked the Count to let him have the boy, and the
 Count, to whom God could have granted no greater boon, readily
 consented, albeit he was very loath to part with Perrot.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080036"/>Having thus provided for his son and daughter, the Count
 resolved to quit the island; and did so, making his way as best he
 could to <placeName>Stamford</placeName>, in <placeName>Ireland</placeName>, where he obtained a menial's place in
 the service of a knight, retainer to one of the earls of that country,
 and so abode there a long while, doing all the irksome and wearisome
 drudgery of a lackey or groom.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080037"/>Meanwhile under the care of the gentle lady at <placeName>London</placeName> Violante
 or Jeannette increased, as in years and stature so also in beauty, and
 in such favour with the lady and her husband and every other
 member of the household and all who knew her that 'twas a
 wonder to see; nor was there any that, observing her bearing and
 manners, would not have said that estate or dignity there was none so
 high or honourable but she was worthy of it. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080038"/>So the lady, who, since
 she had received her from her father, had been unable to learn aught
 else about him than what he had himself told, was minded to marry
 her honourably according to what she deemed to be her rank. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080039"/>But
 God, who justly apportions reward according to merit, having
 regard to her noble birth, her innocence, and the load of suffering
 which the sin of another had laid upon her, ordered otherwise; and
 in His good providence, lest the young gentlewoman should be mated
 with a churl, permitted, we must believe, events to take the course
 they did.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080040"/>The gentle lady with whom Jeannette lived had an only son,
 whom she and her husband loved most dearly, as well because he was
 a son as for his rare and noble qualities, for in truth there were few
 that could compare with him in courtesy and courage and personal
 beauty. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080041"/>Now the young man marked the extraordinary beauty and
 grace of Jeannette, who was about six years his junior, and fell so
 desperately in love with her that he had no eyes for any other maiden;
 but, deeming her to be of low degree, he not only hesitated to ask her
 of his parents in marriage, but, fearing to incur reproof for indulging
 a passion for an inferior, he did his utmost to conceal his love.
 <pb n="143"/>Whereby it gave him far more disquietude than if he had avowed
 it; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080042"/>insomuch that--so extreme waxed his suffering--he fell ill, and
 that seriously. Divers physicians were called in, but, for all their
 scrutiny of his symptoms, they could not determine the nature of
 his malady, and one and all gave him up for lost. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080043"/>Nothing could
 exceed the sorrow and dejection of his father and mother, who again
 and again piteously implored him to discover to them the cause of his
 malady, and received no other answer than sighs or complaints that
 he seemed to be wasting away. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080044"/>Now it so happened that one day,
 Jeannette, who from regard for his mother was sedulous in waiting
 upon him, for some reason or another came into the room where he
 lay, while a very young but very skilful physician sate by him and
 held his pulse. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080045"/>The young man gave her not a word or other sign
 of recognition; but his passion waxed, his heart smote him, and the
 acceleration of his pulse at once betrayed his inward commotion to
 the physician, who, albeit surprised, remained quietly attentive to see
 how long it would last, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080046"/>and observing that it ceased when Jeannette
 left the room, conjectured that he was on the way to explain the
 young man's malady. So, after a while, still holding the young
 man's pulse, he sent for Jeannette, as if he had something to ask
 of her. She returned forthwith; the young man's pulse mounted
 as soon as she entered the room, and fell again as soon as she left
 it. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080047"/>Wherefore the physician no longer hesitated, but rose, and
 taking the young man's father and mother aside, said to them:
 <q>The restoration of your son's health rests not with medical skill,
 but solely with Jeannette, whom, as by unmistakable signs I have
 discovered, he ardently loves, though, so far I can see, she is not
 aware of it. So you know what you have to do, if you value his
 life.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080048"/>The prospect thus afforded of their son's deliverance from
 death reassured the gentleman and his lady, albeit they were troubled,
 misdoubting it must be by his marriage with Jeannette. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080049"/>So, when
 the physician was gone, they went to the sick lad, and the lady
 thus spoke: <q>My son, never would I have believed that thou
 wouldst have concealed from me any desire of thine, least of all
 if such it were that privation should cause thee to languish; for
 well assured thou shouldst have been and shouldst be, that I hold
 thee dear as my very self, and that whatever may be for thy
 contentment, even though it were scarce seemly, I would do it
 <pb n="144"/>for thee; 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080050"/>but, for all thou hast so done, God has shewn Himself
 more merciful to theeward than thyself, and, lest thou die of this
 malady, has given me to know its cause, which is nothing else than
 the excessive love which thou bearest to a young woman, be she
 who she may. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080051"/>Which love in good sooth thou needest not have
 been ashamed to declare; for it is but natural at thy age; and
 hadst thou not loved, I should have deemed thee of very little
 worth. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080052"/>So, my son, be not shy of me, but frankly discover to me
 thy whole heart; and away with this gloom and melancholy
 whereof thy sickness is engendered, and be comforted, and assure
 thyself that there is nought that thou mayst require of me which
 I will not do to give thee ease, so far as my powers may reach,
 seeing that thou art dearer to me than my own life. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080053"/>Away with
 thy shamefastness and fears, and tell me if there is aught wherein
 I may be helpful to thee in the matter of thy love; and if I bestir
 not myself and bring it to pass, account me the most harsh mother
 that ever bore son.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080054"/>The young man was at first somewhat shamefast to hear his
 mother thus speak, but, reflecting that none could do more for his
 happiness than she, he took courage, and thus spoke: <q>Madam,
 my sole reason for concealing my love from you was that I have
 observed that old people for the most part forget that they once were
 young; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080055"/>but, as I see that no such unreasonableness is to be apprehended
 in you, I not only acknowledge the truth of what you say
 that you have discerned, but I will also disclose to you the object of
 my passion, on the understanding that your promise shall to the best
 of your power be performed, as it must be, if I am to be restored to
 you in sound health.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080056"/>Whereupon the lady, making too sure of that
 which was destined to fall out otherwise than she expected, gave him
 every encouragement to discover all his heart, and promised to lose
 no time and spare no pains in endeavouring to compass his gratification.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080057"/><q>Madam,</q> said then the young man, <q>the rare beauty and
 exquisite manners of our Jeannette, my powerlessness to make her
 understand--I do not say commiserate--my love, and my reluctance
 to disclose it to any, have brought me to the condition in which you
 see me; and if your promise be not in one way or another performed,
 be sure that my life will be brief.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080058"/>The lady, deeming that the
 occasion called rather for comfort than for admonition, replied with a
 <pb n="145"/>smile: <q>Ah! my son, was this then of all things the secret of thy
 suffering? Be of good cheer, and leave me to arrange the affair,
 when you are recovered.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080059"/>So, animated by a cheerful hope, the
 young man speedily gave sign of a most marked improvement, which
 the lady observed with great satisfaction, and then began to cast about
 how she might keep her promise. So one day she sent for Jeannette,
 and in a tone of gentle raillery asked her if she had a lover.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080060"/>Jeannette turned very red as she answered: <q>Madam, 'twould scarce,
 nay, 'twould ill become a damsel such as I, poor, outcast from home,
 and in the service of another, to occupy herself with thoughts of
 love.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080061"/>Whereto the lady answered: <q>So you have none, we will
 give you one, who will brighten all your life and give you more joy
 of your beauty; for it is not right that so fair a damsel as you remain
 without a lover.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080062"/><q>Madam,</q> rejoined Jeannette, <q>you found me
 living in poverty with my father, you adopted me, you have brought
 me up as your daughter; wherefore I should, if possible, comply with
 your every wish; but in this matter I will render you no compliance,
 nor do I doubt that I do well. So you will give me a husband, I
 will love him, but no other will I love; for, as patrimony I now have
 none save my honour, that I am minded to guard and preserve while
 my life shall last.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080063"/>Serious though the obstacle was which these
 words opposed to the plan by which the lady had intended to keep
 her promise to her son, her sound judgment could not but secretly
 acknowledge that the spirit which they evinced was much to be
 commended in the damsel. Wherefore she said: <q>Nay but,
 Jeannette; suppose that our Lord the King, who is a young knight
 as thou art a most fair damsel, craved some indulgence of thy
 love, wouldst thou deny him?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080064"/><q>The King,</q> returned Jeannette
 without the least hesitation, <q>might constrain me, but with my
 consent he should never have aught of me that was not honourable.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080065"/>Whereto the lady made no answer, for she now understood the girl's
 temper; but, being minded to put her to the proof, she told her son
 that, as soon as he was recovered, she would arrange that he should
 be closeted with her in the same room, and be thus able to use all his
 arts to bring her to his will, saying that it ill became her to play the
 part of procuress and urge her son's suit upon her own maid. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080066"/>But
 as the young man, by no means approving this idea, suddenly grew
 worse, the lady at length opened her mind to Jeannette, 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080067"/>whom she
 <pb n="146"/>found in the same frame as before, and indeed even more resolute.
 Wherefore she told her husband all that she had done; and as both
 preferred that their son should marry beneath him, and live, than that
 he should remain single and die, they resolved, albeit much disconcerted,
 to give Jeannette to him to wife; and so after long debate
 they did. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080068"/>Whereat Jeannette was overjoyed, and with devout heart
 gave thanks to God that He had not forgotten her; nevertheless she
 still gave no other account of herself than that she was the daughter
 of a Picard. So the young man recovered, and blithe at heart as
 ne'er another, was married, and began to speed the time gaily with
 his bride.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080069"/>Meanwhile Perrot, left in <placeName>Wales</placeName> with the marshal of the King
 of <placeName>England</placeName>, had likewise with increase of years increase of favour
 with his master, and grew up most shapely and well-favoured, and of
 such prowess that in all the island at tourney or joust or any other
 passage of arms he had not his peer; being everywhere known and
 renowned as Perrot the Picard. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080070"/>And as God had not forgotten
 Jeannette, so likewise He made manifest by what follows that He had
 not forgotten Perrot. Well-nigh half the population of those parts
 being swept off by a sudden visitation of deadly pestilence, most of the
 survivors fled therefrom in a panic, so that the country was, to all
 appearance, entirely deserted. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080071"/>Among those that died of the pest
 were the marshal, his lady, and his son, besides brothers and nephews
 and kinsfolk in great number; whereby of his entire household there
 were left only one of his daughters, now marriageable, and a few
 servants, among them Perrot. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080072"/>Now Perrot being a man of such
 notable prowess, the damsel, soon after the pestilence had spent
 itself, took him, with the approval and by the advice of the few folk
 that survived, to be her husband, and made him lord of all that fell
 to her by inheritance. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080073"/>Nor was it long before the King of <placeName>England</placeName>,
 learning that the marshal was dead, made Perrot the Picard, to whose
 merit he was no stranger, marshal in the dead man's room. Such,
 in brief, was the history of the two innocent children, with whom
 the Count of Antwerp had parted, never expecting to see them
 again.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080074"/>'Twas now the eighteenth year since the Count of Antwerp had
 taken flight from <placeName>Paris</placeName>, when, being still in <placeName>Ireland</placeName>, where he had
 led a very sorry and suffering sort of life, and feeling that age was
 <pb n="147"/>now come upon him, he felt a longing to learn, if possible, what was
 become of his children. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080075"/>The fashion of his outward man was now
 completely changed; for long hardship had (as he well knew) given
 to his age a vigour which his youth, lapped in ease, had lacked. So
 he hesitated not to take his leave of the knight with whom he had
 so long resided, and poor and in sorry trim he crossed to <placeName>England</placeName>,
 and made his way to the place where he had left Perrot--to find him
 a great lord and marshal of the King, and in good health, and withal
 a hardy man and very handsome. All which was very grateful to
 the old man; but yet he would not make himself known to his son,
 until he had learned the fate of Jeannette. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080076"/>So forth he fared again,
 nor did he halt until he was come to <placeName>London</placeName>, where, cautiously
 questing about for news of the lady with whom he had left his
 daughter, and how it fared with her, he learned that Jeannette was
 married to the lady's son. Whereat, in the great gladness of his
 heart, he counted all his past adversity but a light matter, since
 he had found his children alive and prosperous. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080077"/>But sore he
 yearned to see Jeannette. Wherefore he took to loitering, as poor
 folk are wont, in the neighbourhood of the house. And so one
 day Jacques Lamiens--such was the name of Jeannette's husband--saw
 him and had pity on him, observing that he was poor and aged,
 and bade one of his servants take him indoors, and for God's sake
 give him something to eat; and nothing loath the servant did so.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080078"/>Now Jeannette had borne Jacques several children, the finest and the
 most winsome children in the world, the eldest no more than eight
 years old; who gathered about the Count as he ate, and, as if by
 instinct divining that he was their grandfather, began to make friends
 with him. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080079"/>He, knowing them for his grandchildren, could not
 conceal his love, and repaid them with caresses; insomuch that they
 would not hearken to their governor when he called them, but
 remained with the Count. Which being reported to Jeannette, she
 came out of her room, crossed to where the Count was sitting with
 the children, and bade them do as their master told them, or she
 would certainly have them whipped. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080080"/>The children began to cry,
 and to say that they would rather stay with the worthy man, whom
 they liked much better than their master; whereat both the lady and
 the Count laughed in sympathy. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080081"/>The Count had risen, with no
 other intention--for he was not minded to disclose his paternity--<pb n="148"/>than
 to pay his daughter the respect due from his poverty to her
 rank, and the sight of her had thrilled his soul with a wondrous
 delight. By her he was and remained unrecognised; utterly
 changed as he was from his former self; aged, grey-haired, bearded,
 lean and tanned--in short to all appearance another man than the
 Count.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080082"/>However, seeing that the children were unwilling to leave him,
 but wept when she made as if she would constrain them, she bade
 the master let them be for a time. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080083"/>So the children remained with
 the worthy man, until by chance Jacques' father came home, and
 learned from the master what had happened. Whereupon, having a
 grudge against Jeannette, he said: <q>Let them be; and God give
 them the ill luck which He owes them: whence they sprang, thither
 they must needs return; they descend from a vagabond on the
 mother's side, and so 'tis no wonder that they consort readily with
 vagabonds.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080084"/>The Count caught these words and was sorely pained,
 but, shrugging his shoulders, bore the affront silently as he had borne
 many another. Jacques, who had noted his children's fondness for
 the worthy man, to wit, the Count, was displeased; but nevertheless,
 such was the love he bore them, that, rather than see them weep, he
 gave order that, if the worthy man cared to stay there in his service,
 he should be received. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080085"/>The Count answered that he would gladly
 do so, but that he was fit for nothing except to look after horses, to
 which he had been used all his life. So a horse was assigned him,
 and when he had groomed him, he occupied himself in playing with
 the children.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080086"/>While Fortune thus shaped the destinies of the Count of Antwerp
 and his children, it so befell that after a long series of truces
 made with the Germans the King of <placeName>France</placeName> died, and his crown
 passed to his son, whose wife had been the occasion of the Count's
 banishment. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080087"/>The new king, as soon as the last truce with the
 Germans was run out, renewed hostilities with extraordinary vigour,
 being aided by his brother of <placeName>England</placeName> with a large army under the
 command of his marshal, Perrot, and his other marshal's son,
 Jacques Lamiens. With them went the worthy man, that is to say,
 the Count, who, unrecognised by any, served for a long while in the
 army in the capacity of groom, and acquitted himself both in counsel
 and in arms with a wisdom and valour unwonted in one of his
 <pb n="149"/>supposed rank. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080088"/>The war was still raging when the Queen of <placeName>France</placeName>
 fell seriously ill, and, as she felt her end approach, made a humble and
 contrite confession of all her sins to the Archbishop of <placeName>Rouen</placeName>, who
 was universally reputed a good and most holy man. Among her other
 sins she confessed the great wrong that she had done to the Count
 of Antwerp; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080089"/>nor was she satisfied to confide it to the Archbishop,
 but recounted the whole affair, as it had passed, to not a few other
 worthy men, whom she besought to use their influence with the
 King to procure the restitution of the Count, if he were still alive,
 and if not, of his children, to honour and estate. And so, dying
 shortly afterwards, she was honourably buried. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080090"/>The Queen's confession
 wrung from the King a sigh or two of compunction for a
 brave man cruelly wronged; after which he caused proclamation
 to be made throughout the army and in many other parts, that
 whoso should bring him tidings of the Count of Antwerp, or his
 children, should receive from him such a guerdon for each of them
 as should justly be matter of marvel; seeing that he held him
 acquitted, by confession of the Queen, of the crime for which he
 had been banished, and was therefore now minded to grant him not
 only restitution but increase of honour and estate.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080091"/>Now the Count, being still with the army in his character of
 groom, heard the proclamation, which he did not doubt was made
 in good faith. Wherefore he hied him forthwith to Jacques, and
 begged a private interview with him and Perrot, that he might discover
 to them that whereof the King was in quest. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080092"/>So the meeting
 was had; and Perrot was on the point of declaring himself, when
 the Count anticipated him: <q>Perrot,</q> he said, <q>Jacques here has
 thy sister to wife, but never a dowry had he with her. Wherefore
 that thy sister be not dowerless, 'tis my will that he, and no other,
 have this great reward which the King offers for thee, son, as he
 shall certify, of the Count of Antwerp, and for his wife and thy
 sister, Violante, and for me, Count of Antwerp, thy father.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080093"/>So
 hearing, Perrot scanned the Count closely, and forthwith recognising
 him, burst into tears, and throwing himself at his feet embraced
 him, saying: <q>My father, welcome, welcome indeed art thou.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080094"/>Whereupon, between what he had heard from the Count and what
 he had witnessed on the part of Perrot, Jacques was so overcome
 with wonder and delight, that at first he was at a loss to know how
 <pb n="150"/>to act. However, giving entire credence to what he had heard, and
 recalling insulting language which he had used towards the quondam
 groom, the Count, he was sore stricken with shame, and wept, and
 fell at the Count's feet, and humbly craved his pardon for all past
 offences; which the Count, raising him to his feet, most graciously
 granted him. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080095"/>So with many a tear and many a hearty laugh the
 three men compared their several fortunes; which done, Perrot and
 Jacques would have arrayed the Count in manner befitting his rank,
 but he would by no means suffer it, being minded that Jacques, so
 soon as he was well assured that the guerdon was forthcoming,
 should present him to the King in his garb of groom, that thereby
 the King might be the more shamed. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080096"/>So Jacques, with the Count
 and Perrot, went presently to the King and offered to present to him
 the Count and his children, provided the guerdon were forthcoming
 according to the proclamation. Jacques wondered not a little as
 forthwith at a word from the King a guerdon was produced ample
 for all three, and he was bidden take it away with him, so only that
 he should in very truth produce, as he had promised, the Count and
 his children in the royal presence. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080097"/>Then, withdrawing a little and
 causing his quondam groom, now Count, to come forward with
 Perrot, he said: <q>Sire, father and son are before you; the daughter,
 my wife, is not here, but, God willing, you shall soon see her.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080098"/>So
 hearing, the King surveyed the Count, whom, notwithstanding his
 greatly changed appearance, he at length recognised, and well-nigh
 moved to tears, he raised him from his knees to his feet, and kissed
 and embraced him. He also gave a kindly welcome to Perrot, and
 bade forthwith furnish the Count with apparel, servants and horses,
 suited to his rank; all which was no sooner said than done. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080099"/>Moreover
 the King shewed Jacques no little honour, and particularly
 questioned him of all his past adventures.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02080100"/>As Jacques was about to take the noble guerdons assigned him for
 the discovery of the Count and his children, the Count said to
 him: <q>Take these tokens of the magnificence of our Lord the
 King, and forget not to tell thy father that 'tis from no vagabond
 that thy children, his and my grandchildren, descend on the mother's
 side.</q> So Jacques took the guerdons, and sent for his wife and
 mother to join him at <placeName>Paris</placeName>. Thither also came Perrot's wife: and
 there with all magnificence they were entertained by the Count, to
 <pb n="151"/>whom the King had not only restored all his former estates and
 honours, but added thereto others, whereby he was now become a
 greater man than he had ever been before. Then with the
 Count's leave they all returned to their several houses. The
 Count himself spent the rest of his days at <placeName>Paris</placeName> in greater glory
 than ever.</p></div><pb n="152"/><!--*************************Novella 9************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0209"><head>Novel IX</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090001"/><!--(i)-->Bernabò of <placeName>Genoa</placeName>, deceived by Ambrogiuolo, loses his

 as merchants use, for divers reasons proper to each, at a hostelry in
 <placeName>Paris</placeName>, and having one evening jovially supped together, fell a talking
 <pb n="153"/>of divers matters, and so, passing from one topic to another, they
 came at last to discuss the ladies whom they had left at home, 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090005"/>and
 one jocosely said: <q>I cannot answer for my wife; but for myself
 I own, that, whenever a girl that is to my mind comes in my way, I

 of the new-comer to the best of my power.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090006"/><q>And so do I,</q> said

 wall are quits.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090007"/>A third added his testimony to the same effect;
 and in short all seemed to concur in the opinion that the ladies they
 had left behind them were not likely to neglect their opportunities,
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090008"/>when one, a Genoese, Bernabò Lomellin by name, dissociated
 himself from the rest, affirming that by especial grace of God he was
 blessed with a wife who was, perhaps, the most perfect paragon to be
 found in <placeName>Italy</placeName> of all the virtues proper to a lady, ay, and in great
 measure, to a knight or squire; inasmuch as she was fair, still quite
 young, handy, hardy, and clever beyond all other women in
 embroidery work and all other forms of lady's handicraft. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090009"/>Moreover
 so well-mannered, discreet and sensible was she that she was as fit to
 wait at a lord's table as any squire or manservant or such like, the
 best and most adroit that could be found. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090010"/>To which encomium he
 added that she knew how to manage a horse, fly a hawk, read, write
 and cast up accounts better than as if she were a merchant; and after
 much more in the same strain of commendation he came at length to
 the topic of their conversation, asseverating with an oath that 'twas
 not possible to find a woman more honest, more chaste than she:
 nay, he verily believed that, if he remained from home for ten years,
 or indeed for the rest of his days, she would never think of any of
 these casual amours with any other man.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090011"/>Among the merchants who thus gossiped was a young man,
 Ambrogiuolo da Piacenza by name, who, when Bernabò thus concluded
 his eulogy of his wife, broke out into a mighty laugh, and
 asked him with a leer, whether he of all men had this privilege by
 special patent of the Emperor. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090012"/>Bernabò replied, somewhat angrily,
 that 'twas a boon conferred upon him by God, who was rather more
 powerful than the Emperor. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090013"/>To which Ambrogiuolo rejoined: <q>I
 make no doubt, Bernabò, that thou believest that what thou sayst is
 true; but, methinks, thou hast been but a careless observer of the
 <pb n="154"/>nature of things; otherwise, I do not take thee to be of so gross
 understanding but that thou must have discerned therein reasons
 for speaking more judiciously of this matter. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090014"/>And that thou
 mayst not think that we, who have spoken with much freedom
 about our wives, deem them to be of another nature and mould
 than thine, but mayst know that we have but uttered what
 common sense dictates, I am minded to go a little further into
 this matter with thee. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090015"/>I have always understood, that of all mortal
 beings created by God man is the most noble, and next after him
 woman: man, then, being, as is universally believed, and is indeed
 apparent by his works, more perfect than woman, must without
 doubt be endowed with more firmness and constancy, women being
 one and all more mobile, for reasons not a few and founded in nature,
 which I might adduce, but mean for the present to pass over. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090016"/>And
 yet, for all his greater firmness, man cannot withstand--I do not say
 a woman's supplications, but--the mere lust of the eye which she
 unwittingly excites, and that in such sort that he will do all that is in
 his power to induce her to pleasure him, not once, perhaps, in the
 course of a month, but a thousand times a day. How, then, shouldst
 thou expect a woman, mobile by nature, to resist the supplications,
 the flatteries, the gifts, and all the other modes of attack that an
 accomplished seducer will employ? Thou thinkest that she may
 hold out! <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090017"/>Nay verily, affirm it as thou mayst, I doubt thou dost not
 really so think. Thou dost not deny that thy wife is a woman, a
 creature of flesh and blood like the rest; and if so, she must have the
 same cravings, the same natural propensities as they, and no more
 force to withstand them; wherefore 'tis at least possible, that,
 however honest she be, she will do as others do; and nought that is
 possible admits such peremptory denial or affirmation of its contrary
 as this of thine.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090018"/>Whereto Bernabò returned: <q>I am a merchant and no philosopher,
 and I will give thee a merchant's answer. I acknowledge
 that what thou sayst is true of vain and foolish women who have no
 modesty, but such as are discreet are so sensitive in regard of their
 honour that they become better able to preserve it than men,
 who have no such solicitude; and my wife is one of this sort.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090019"/><q>Doubtless,</q> observed Ambrogiuolo, <q>few would be found to indulge
 in these casual amours, if every time they did so a horn grew out on
 <pb n="155"/>the brow to attest the fact; but not only does no horn make its
 appearance but not so much as a trace or vestige of a horn, so only
 they be but prudent; and the shame and dishonour consist only in
 the discovery: wherefore, if they can do it secretly, they do it, or are
 fools to refrain. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090020"/>Hold it for certain that she alone is chaste who
 either had never suit made to her, or, suing herself, was repulsed.
 And albeit I know that for reasons true and founded in nature this
 must needs be, yet I should not speak so positively thereof as I do,
 had I not many a time with many a woman verified it by experience.
 And I assure thee that, had I but access to this most saintly wife of
 thine, I should confidently expect very soon to have the same success
 with her as with others.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090021"/>Then Bernabò angrily: <q>'Twere long
 and tedious to continue this discussion. I should have my say, and
 thou thine, and in the end 'twould come to nothing. But, as thou
 sayst that they are all so compliant, and that thou art so accomplished
 a seducer, I give thee this pledge of the honour of my wife: I
 consent to forfeit my head, if thou shouldst succeed in bringing her
 to pleasure thee in such a sort; and shouldst thou fail, thou shalt
 forfeit to me no more than one thousand florins of gold.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090022"/>Elated by this unexpected offer, Ambrogiuolo replied: <q>I know
 not what I should do with thy blood, Bernabò, if I won the wager;
 but, if thou wouldst have proof of what I have told thee, lay five
 thousand florins of gold, which must be worth less to thee than thy
 head, against a thousand of mine, and, whereas thou makest no
 stipulation as to time, I will bind myself to go to <placeName>Genoa</placeName>, and within
 three months from my departure hence to have had my pleasure of
 thy wife, and in witness thereof to bring back with me, of the things
 which she prizes most dearly, evidence of her compliance so weighty
 and conclusive that thou thyself shalt admit the fact; nor do I
 require ought of thee but that thou pledge thy faith neither to come
 to <placeName>Genoa</placeName> nor to write word to her of this matter during the said
 three months.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090023"/>Bernabò professed himself well content; and though
 the rest of the company, seeing that the compact might well have
 very evil consequences, did all that they could to frustrate it, yet the
 two men were now so heated that, against the will of the others, they
 set it down fairly in writing, and signed it each with his own hand.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090024"/>This done, Ambrogiuolo, leaving Bernabò at <placeName>Paris</placeName>, posted with all
 speed for <placeName>Genoa</placeName>. Arrived there, he set to work with great caution;
 <pb n="156"/>and having found out the quarter in which the lady resided, he
 learned in the course of a few days enough about her habits of life
 and her character to know that what Bernabò had told him was
 rather less than the truth. So, recognising that his enterprise was
 hopeless, he cast about for some device whereby he might cover his
 defeat; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090025"/>and having got speech of a poor woman, who was much in
 the lady's house, as also in her favour, he bribed her (other means
 failing) to convey him in a chest, which he had had made for the
 purpose, not only into the house but into the bedroom of the lady,
 whom the good woman, following Bernabò's instructions, induced to
 take charge of it for some days, during which, she said, she would be
 away.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090026"/>So the lady suffered the chest to remain in the room; and when
 the night was so far spent that Bernabò thought she must be asleep,
 he opened it with some tools with which he had provided himself,
 and stole softly out. There was a light in the room, so that he was
 able to form an idea of its situation, to take note of the pictures and
 everything else of consequence that it contained, and to commit the
 whole to memory. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090027"/>This done, he approached the bed; and observing
 that the lady, and a little girl that was with her, were fast asleep, he
 gently uncovered her, and saw that nude she was not a whit less
 lovely than when dressed: he looked about for some mark that might
 serve him as evidence that he had seen her in this state, but found
 nothing except a mole, which she had under the left breast, and
 which was fringed with a few fair hairs that shone like gold. So
 beautiful was she that he was tempted at the hazard of his life to
 take his place by her side in the bed; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090028"/>but, remembering what he had
 heard of her inflexible obduracy in such affairs, he did not venture;
 but quietly replaced the bedclothes; and having passed the best part
 of the night very much at his ease in her room, he took from one of
 the lady's boxes a purse, a gown, a ring and a girdle, and with these
 tokens returned to the chest, and locked himself in as before. In
 this manner he passed two nights, nor did the lady in the least
 suspect his presence. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090029"/>On the third day the good woman came by
 preconcert to fetch her chest, and took it back to the place whence
 she had brought it. So Ambrogiuolo got out, paid her the stipulated
 sum, and hied him back with all speed to <placeName>Paris</placeName>, where he arrived
 within the appointed time. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090030"/>Then, in presence of the merchants
 <pb n="157"/>who were witnesses of his altercation with Bernabò, and the
 wager
 to which it had given occasion, he told Bernabò that he had won
 the bet, having done what he had boasted that he would do; and in
 proof thereof he first of all described the appearance of the room and
 the pictures, and then displayed the articles belonging to the lady
 which he had brought away with him, averring that she had given
 them to him. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090031"/>Bernabò acknowledged the accuracy of his description
 of the room, and that the articles did really belong to his wife, but
 objected that Ambrogiuolo might have learned characteristic features
 of the room from one of the servants, and have come by the things
 in a similar way, and therefore, unless he had something more to say,
 he could not justly claim to have won the bet. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090032"/><q>Verily,</q> rejoined
 Ambrogiuolo, <q>this should suffice; but, as thou requirest that I say
 somewhat further, I will satisfy thee. I say, then, that Madam
 Zinevra, thy wife, has under her left breast a mole of some size,
 around which are, perhaps, six hairs of a golden hue.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090033"/>As Bernabò
 heard this, it was as if a knife pierced his heart, so poignant was his
 suffering; and, though no word escaped him, the complete alteration
 of his mien bore unmistakable witness to the truth of Ambrogiuolo's
 words. After a while he said: <q>Gentlemen, 'tis even as Ambrogiuolo
 says; he has won the bet; he has but to come when
 he will, and he shall be paid.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090034"/>And so the very next day
 Ambrogiuolo was paid in full, and Bernabò, intent on wreaking
 vengeance on his wife, left <placeName>Paris</placeName> and set his face towards <placeName>Genoa</placeName>.
 He had no mind, however, to go home, and accordingly halted at an
 estate which he had some twenty miles from the city, whither he
 sent forward a servant, in whom he reposed much trust, with two
 horses and a letter advising the lady of his return, and bidding her
 come out to meet him. At the same time he gave the servant
 secret instructions to choose some convenient place, and ruthlessly
 put the lady to death, and so return to him. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090035"/>On his arrival at
 <placeName>Genoa</placeName> the servant delivered his message and the letter to the lady,
 who received him with great cheer, and next morning got on
 horseback and set forth with him for her husband's estate. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090036"/>So they
 rode on, talking of divers matters, until they came to a deep gorge,
 very lonely, and shut in by high rocks and trees. The servant,
 deeming this just the place in which he might without risk of
 discovery fulfil his lord's behest, whipped out a knife, and seizing
 <pb n="158"/>the lady by the arm, said: <q>Madam, commend your soul to God,
 for here must end at once your journey and your life.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090037"/>Terror-stricken
 by what she saw and heard, the lady cried out: <q>Mercy
 for God's sake; before thou slay me, tell me at least wherein I have
 wronged thee, that thou art thus minded to put me to death.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090038"/><q>Madam,</q> said the servant, <q>me you have in no wise wronged;
 but your husband--how you may have wronged him I know not--charged
 me shew you no mercy, but to slay you on this journey,
 and threatened to have me hanged by the neck, should I not do so.
 You know well how bound I am to him, and that I may not
 disobey any of his commands: God knows I pity you, but yet I can
 no otherwise.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090039"/>Whereat the lady burst into tears, saying: <q>Mercy
 for God's sake; make not thyself the murderer of one that has done
 thee no wrong, at the behest of another. The all-seeing God knows
 that I never did aught to merit such requital at my husband's hands.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090040"/>But enough of this for the present: there is a way in which thou
 canst serve at once God and thy master and myself, if thou wilt do
 as I bid thee: take, then, these clothes of mine and give me in
 exchange just thy doublet and a hood; and carry the clothes with
 thee to my lord and thine, and tell him that thou hast slain me;
 and I swear to thee by the life which I shall have received at thy
 hands, that I will get me gone, and there abide whence news of me
 shall never reach either him or thee or these parts.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090041"/>The servant,
 being loath to put her to death, soon yielded to pity; and so he took
 her clothes, allowing her to retain a little money that she had, and
 gave her one of his worser doublets and a hood; then, praying her
 to depart the country, he left her afoot in the gorge, and returned
 to his master, whom he gave to understand that he had not only
 carried out his orders but had left the lady's body a prey to wolves.
 Bernabò after a while returned to <placeName>Genoa</placeName>, where, the supposed
 murder being bruited abroad, he was severely censured.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090042"/>Alone and disconsolate, the lady, as night fell, disguised herself
 as best she could, and hied her to a neighbouring village, where,
 having procured what was needful from an old woman, she shortened
 the doublet and fitted it to her figure, converted her chemise into a
 pair of breeches, cut her hair close, and, in short, completely disguised
 herself as a sailor. She then made her way to the coast, where by
 chance she encountered a Catalan gentleman, by name Segner
 <pb n="159"/>Encararch, who had landed from one of his ships, which lay in the
 offing, to recreate himself at <placeName>Alba</placeName>, where there was a fountain. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090043"/>So
 she made overture to him of her services, was engaged and taken
 aboard the ship, assuming the name Sicurano da Finale. The
 gentleman put her in better trim as to clothes, and found her so apt
 and handy at service that he was exceeding well pleased with her.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090044"/>Not long afterwards the Catalan sailed one of his carracks to
 <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>. He took with him some peregrine falcons, which he
 presented to the Soldan, who feasted him once or twice; and noting
 with approbation the behaviour of Sicurano, who always attended
 his master, he craved him of the Catalan, which request the Catalan
 reluctantly granted. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090045"/>Sicurano proved so apt for his new service
 that he was soon as high in grace and favour with the Soldan as he
 had been with the Catalan. Wherefore, when the time of year
 came at which there was wont to be held at Acre, then under the
 Soldan's sway, a great fair, much frequented by merchants, Christian
 and Saracen alike, and to which, for the security of the merchants
 and their goods, the Soldan always sent one of his great officers of
 state with other officers and a guard to attend upon them, 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090046"/>he determined
 to send Sicurano, who by this time knew the language very
 well. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090047"/>So Sicurano was sent to Acre as governor and captain of the
 guard for the protection of the merchants and merchandise. Arrived
 there, he bestirred himself with great zeal in all matters appertaining
 to his office; and as he went his rounds of inspection, he espied
 among the merchants not a few from <placeName>Italy</placeName>, Sicilians, Pisans, Genoese,
 Venetians, and so forth, with whom he consorted the more readily
 because they reminded him of his native land. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090048"/>And so it befell that,
 alighting once at a shop belonging to some Venetian merchants, he
 saw there among other trinkets a purse and a girdle, which he
 forthwith recognised as having once been his own. Concealing
 his surprise, he blandly asked whose they were, and if they were
 for sale. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090049"/>He was answered by Ambrogiuolo da Piacenza, who had
 come thither with much merchandise aboard a Venetian ship, and
 hearing that the captain of the guard was asking about the ownership
 of the purse and girdle, came forward, and said with a smile: <q>The
 things are mine, Sir, and I am not disposed to sell them, but, if they
 take your fancy, I will gladly give them to you.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090050"/>Observing the
 smile, Sicurano misdoubted that something had escaped him by
 <pb n="160"/>which Ambrogiuolo had recognised him; but he answered with a
 composed air: <q>Thou dost smile, perchance, to see me, a soldier,
 come asking about this woman's gear?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090051"/><q>Not so, Sir,</q> returned
 Ambrogiuolo; <q>I smile to think of the manner in which I came
 by it.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090052"/><q>And pray,</q> said Sicurano, <q>if thou hast no reason to
 conceal it, tell me, in God's name, how thou didst come by the
 things.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090053"/><q>Why, Sir,</q> said Ambrogiuolo, <q>they were given me by
 a Genoese lady, with whom I once spent a night, Madam Zinevra
 by name, wife of Bernabò Lomellin, who prayed me to keep them
 as a token of her love. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090054"/>I smiled just now to think of the folly of
 Bernabò, who was so mad as to stake five thousand florins of gold
 against my thousand that I could not bring his wife to surrender to
 me; which I did. I won the bet; and he, who should rather have
 been punished for his insensate folly, than she for doing what all
 women do, had her put to death, as I afterwards gathered, on his
 way back from <placeName>Paris</placeName> to <placeName>Genoa</placeName>.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090055"/>Ambrogiuolo had not done speaking before Sicurano had discerned
 in him the evident cause of her husband's animosity against
 her, and all her woe, and had made up her mind that he should
 not escape with impunity. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090056"/>She therefore feigned to be much
 interested by this story, consorted frequently and very familiarly
 with Ambrogiuolo, and insidiously captured his confidence, insomuch
 that at her suggestion, when the fair was done, he, taking with
 him all his wares, accompanied her to <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>, where she
 provided him with a shop, and put no little of her own money in
 his hands; so that he, finding it very profitable, was glad enough
 to stay. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090057"/>Anxious to make her innocence manifest to Bernabò,
 Sicurano did not rest until, with the help of some great Genoese
 merchants that were in <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>, she had devised an expedient
 to draw him thither. Her plan succeeded; Bernabò arrived; and,
 as he was now very poor, she privily arranged that he should be
 entertained by one of her friends until occasion should serve to carry
 out her design. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090058"/>She had already induced Ambrogiuolo to tell his
 story to the Soldan, and the Soldan to interest himself in the matter.
 So Bernabò being come, and further delay inexpedient, she seized
 her opportunity, and persuaded the Soldan to cite Ambrogiuolo and
 Bernabò before him, that in Bernabò's presence Ambrogiuolo
 might
 be examined of his boast touching Bernabò's wife, and the truth
 <pb n="161"/>thereof, if not to be had from him by gentle means, be elicited by
 torture. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090059"/>So the Soldan, having Ambrogiuolo and Bernabò before
 him, amid a great concourse of his people questioned Ambrogiuolo
 of the five thousand florins of gold that he had won from Bernabò,
 and sternly bade him tell the truth. Still more harsh was the
 aspect of Sicurano, in whom Ambrogiuolo had placed his chief
 reliance, but who now threatened him with the direst torments if
 the truth were not forthcoming. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090060"/>Thus hard bested on this side and
 on that, and in a manner coerced, Ambrogiuolo, thinking he had
 but to refund, in presence of Bernabò and many others accurately
 recounted the affair as it had happened. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090061"/>When he had done, Sicurano,
 as minister of the Soldan for the time being, turned to Bernabò and
 said: <q>And thy wife, thus falsely accused, what treatment did she
 meet with at thy hands?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090062"/><q>Mortified,</q> said Bernabò, <q>by the
 loss
 of my money, and the dishonour which I deemed to have been
 done me by my wife, I was so overcome by wrath that I had her put
 to death by one of my servants, who brought me word that her
 corpse had been instantly devoured by a pack of wolves.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090063"/>Albeit the Soldan had heard and understood all that had passed,
 yet he did not as yet apprehend the object for which Sicurano had
 pursued the investigation. Wherefore Sicurano thus addressed him:
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090064"/><q>My lord, what cause this good lady has to boast of her lover and
 her husband you have now abundant means of judging; seeing that
 the lover at one and the same time despoils her of her honour,
 blasting her fair fame with slanderous accusations, and ruins her
 husband; who, more prompt to trust the falsehood of another than
 the verity of which his own long experience should have assured
 him, devotes her to death and the devouring wolves; and, moreover,
 such is the regard, such the love which both bear her that, though
 both tarry a long time with her, neither recognises her. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090065"/>However,
 that you may know full well what chastisements they have severally
 deserved, I will now cause her to appear in your presence and theirs,
 provided you, of your especial grace, be pleased to punish the deceiver
 and pardon the deceived.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090066"/>The Soldan, being minded in this matter
 to defer entirely to Sicurano, answered that he was well content,
 and bade produce the lady. Bernabò, who had firmly believed that
 she was dead, was lost in wonder; likewise Ambrogiuolo, who now
 divined his evil plight, and dreading something worse than the
 <pb n="162"/>disbursement of money, knew not whether to expect the lady's advent
 with fear or with hope. His suspense was not of long duration; 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090067"/>for,
 as soon as the Soldan signified his assent, Sicurano, weeping, threw
 herself on her knees at his feet, and discarding the tones, as she
 would fain have divested herself of the outward semblance, of a man,
 said: 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090068"/>.<q>My lord, that forlorn, hapless Zinevra am I, falsely and
 foully slandered by this traitor Ambrogiuolo, and by my cruel
 and unjust husband delivered over to his servant to slaughter and
 cast out as a prey to the wolves; for which cause I have now for
 six years been a wanderer on the face of the earth in the guise of
 a man.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090069"/>Then rending her robes in front and baring her breast, she
 made it manifest to the Soldan and all others who were present,
 that she was indeed a woman; then turning to Ambrogiuolo she
 haughtily challenged him to say when she had ever lain with him,
 as he had boasted. Ambrogiuolo said never a word, for he now
 recognised her, and it was as if shame had reft from him the power
 of speech. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090070"/>The Soldan, who had never doubted that Sicurano was
 a man, was so wonder-struck by what he saw and heard that at
 times he thought it must be all a dream. But, as wonder gave
 place to conviction of the truth, he extolled in the amplest terms the
 constancy and virtue and seemliness with which Zinevra, erstwhile
 Sicurano, had ordered her life. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090071"/>He then directed that she should
 be most nobly arrayed in the garb of her sex and surrounded by a
 bevy of ladies. Mindful of her intercession, he granted to Bernabò
 the life which he had forfeited; and she, when Bernabò threw
 himself at her feet and wept and craved her pardon, raised him,
 unworthy though he was, to his feet and generously forgave him,
 and tenderly embraced him as her husband. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090072"/>Ambrogiuolo the
 Soldan commanded to be bound to a stake, that his bare flesh,
 anointed with honey, might be exposed to the sun on one of the
 heights of the city, there to remain until it should fall to pieces
 of its own accord: and so 'twas done. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090073"/>He then decreed that the
 lady should have the traitor's estate, which was worth not less but
 rather more than ten thousand doubloons; whereto he added, in
 jewels and vessels of gold and silver and in money, the equivalent
 of upwards of other ten thousand doubloons, having first entertained
 her and her husband with most magnificent and ceremonious cheer,
 accordant with the lady's worth. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090074"/>Which done, he placed a ship at
 <pb n="163"/>their disposal, and gave them leave to return to <placeName>Genoa</placeName> at their
 pleasure. So to <placeName>Genoa</placeName> they returned very rich and happy, and
 were received with all honour, especially Madam Zinevra, whom
 all the citizens had believed to be dead, and whom thenceforth, so
 long as she lived, they held of great consequence and excellency.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02090075"/>As for Ambrogiuolo, the very same day that he was bound to the
 stake, the honey with which his body was anointed attracted such
 swarms of flies, wasps and gadflies, wherewith that country abounds,
 that not only was his life sucked from him but his very bones were
 completely denuded of flesh; in which state, hanging by the sinews,
 they remained a long time undisturbed, for a sign and a testimony
 of his baseness to all that passed by. And so the deceived had the
 better of the deceiver.</p></div><pb n="164"/><!--*************************Novella 10*********************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0210"><head>Novel X</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02100001"/><!--(i)-->Paganino da <placeName>Monaco</placeName> carries off the wife of Messer

 that there was in <placeName>Pisa</placeName>a judge, better endowed with mental than
 with physical vigour, by name Messer Ricciardo di Chinzica, who,
 being minded to take a wife, and thinking, perhaps, to satisfy her
 by the same resources which served him for his studies, was to be
 suited with none that had not both youth and beauty, qualities
 which he would rather have eschewed, if he had known how to
 give himself as good counsel as he gave to others. However, being
 very rich, he had his desire. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02100006"/>Messer <persName>Lotto</persName> Gualandi gave him in
 marriage one of his daughters, Bartolomea by name, a maid as fair
 and fit for amorous dalliance as any in <placeName>Pisa</placeName>, though few maids be
 there that do not shew as spotted lizards. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02100007"/>The judge brought her
 home with all pomp and ceremony, and had a brave and lordly
 wedding; but in the essay which he made the very first night to
 serve her so as to consummate the marriage he made a false move,
 and drew the game much to his own disadvantage; for next morning
 his lean, withered and scarce animate frame was only to be
 re-quickened by draughts of vernaccia,<note>A strong white wine.</note>
 artificial restoratives and the
 like remedies. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02100008"/>So, taking a more sober estimate of his powers than
 he had been wont, the worthy judge began to give his wife lessons
 from a calendar, which might have served as a horn-book, and
 perhaps had been put together at <placeName>Ravenna</placeName>:<note>The saying went, that owing
 to the multitude of churches at <placeName>Ravenna</placeName>
 every day was there a saint's day.</note><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02100009"/>inasmuch as, according
 to his shewing, there was not a day in the year but was sacred,
 not to one saint only, but to many; in honour of whom for divers
 reasons it behoved men and women to abstain from carnal intercourse;
 whereto he added fast-days, Ember-days, vigils of Apostles
 and other saints, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, the whole of Lent,
 certain lunar mansions, and many other exceptions, arguing perchance,
 that the practice of men with women abed should have
 its times of vacation no less than the administration of the law.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02100010"/>In this method, which caused the lady grievous dumps, he long
 persisted, hardly touching her once a month, and observing her
 closely, lest another should give her to know working-days, as he
 had taught her holidays.</p><pb n="166"/><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02100011"/>Now it so befell that, one hot season, Messer Ricciardo thought
 he would like to visit a very beautiful estate which he had near
 <placeName>Monte Nero</placeName>, there to take the air and recreate himself for some
 days, and thither accordingly he went with his fair lady. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02100012"/>While
 there, to amuse her, he arranged for a day's fishing; and so, he in
 one boat with the fishermen, and she in another with other ladies,
 they put out to watch the sport, which they found so delightsome,
 that almost before they knew where they were they were some miles
 out to sea. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02100013"/>And while they were thus engrossed with the sport, a
 galliot of Paganino da Mare, a very famous corsair of those days,
 hove in sight and bore down upon the boats, and, for all the speed
 they made, came up with that in which were the ladies; and on
 sight of the fair lady Paganino, regardless of all else, bore her off to
 his galliot before the very eyes of Messer Ricciardo, who was by this
 time ashore, and forthwith was gone. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02100014"/>The chagrin of the judge,
 who was jealous of the very air, may readily be imagined. But
 'twas to no purpose that, both at <placeName>Pisa</placeName>and elsewhere, he moaned and
 groaned over the wickedness of the corsairs, for he knew neither by
 whom his wife had been abducted, nor whither she had been taken.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02100015"/>Paganino, meanwhile, deemed himself lucky to have gotten so
 beautiful a prize; and being unmarried, he was minded never to
 part with her, and addressed himself by soft words to soothe the
 sorrow which kept her in a flood of tears. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02100016"/>Finding words of little
 avail, he at night passed--the more readily that the calendar had
 slipped from his girdle, and all feasts and holidays from his <!--Rala's note: poor
      translation: it should be  her--> mind--to
 acts of love, and on this wise administered consolation so effective
 that before they were come to <placeName>Monaco</placeName> she had completely forgotten
 the judge and his canons, and had begun to live with Paganino as
 merrily as might be. So he brought her to <placeName>Monaco</placeName>, where, besides
 the daily and nightly solace which he gave her, he honourably
 entreated her as his wife.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02100017"/>Not long afterwards Messer Ricciardo coming to know where
 his wife was, and being most ardently desirous to have her back, and
 thinking none but he would understand exactly what to do in the
 circumstances, determined to go and fetch her himself, being prepared
 to spend any sum of money that might be demanded by way of
 ransom. So he took ship, and being come to <placeName>Monaco</placeName>, he both saw
 her and was seen by her; which news she communicated to
 <pb n="167"/>Paganino in the evening, and told him how she was minded to
 behave. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02100018"/>Next morning Messer Ricciardo, encountering Paganino,
 made up to him; and soon assumed a very familiar and friendly air,
 while Paganino pretended not to know him, being on his guard to see
 what he would be at. So Messer Ricciardo, as soon as he deemed
 the time ripe, as best and most delicately he was able, disclosed to
 Paganino the business on which he had come, praying him to take
 whatever in the way of ransom he chose and restore him the lady.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02100019"/>Paganino replied cheerily: <q>Right glad I am to see you here, Sir;
 and briefly thus I answer you: True it is that I have here a young
 woman; whether she be your wife or another man's, I know not,
 for you are none of my acquaintance, nor is she, except for the short
 time that she has been with me. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02100020"/>If, as you say, you are her husband,
 why, as you seem to me to be a pleasant gentleman, I will even take
 you to her, and I doubt not she will know you well; if she says that
 it is even as you say, and is minded to go with you, you shall give
 me just what you like by way of ransom, so pleasant have I found
 you; otherwise 'twill be churlish in you to think of taking her from
 me, who am a young man, and as fit to keep a woman as another,
 and moreover never knew any woman so agreeable.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02100021"/><q>My wife,</q>
 said Ricciardo, <q>she is beyond all manner of doubt, as thou shalt
 see; for so soon as thou bringest me to her, she will throw her arms
 about my neck; wherefore as thou art minded, even so be it; I ask
 no more.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02100022"/><q>Go we then,</q> said Paganino; 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02100023"/>and forthwith they
 went into the house, and Paganino sent for the lady while they
 waited in one of the halls. By and by she entered from one of the
 adjoining rooms all trim and tricked out, and advanced to the place
 where Paganino and Messer Ricciardo were standing, but never a
 word did she vouchsafe to her husband, any more than if he had been
 some stranger whom Paganino had brought into the house. Whereat
 the judge was mightily amazed, having expected to be greeted by
 her with the heartiest of cheer, and began to ruminate thus:
 Perhaps I am so changed by the melancholy and prolonged heartache,
 to which I have been a prey since I lost her, that she does not
 recognise me. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02100024"/>Wherefore he said: <q>Madam, cause enough have
 I to rue it that I took thee a fishing, for never yet was known such
 grief as has been mine since I lost thee; and now it seems as if thou
 dost not recognise me, so scant of courtesy is thy greeting. Seest
 <pb n="168"/>thou not that I am thy Messer Ricciardo, come hither prepared to
 pay whatever this gentleman, in whose house we are, may demand,
 that I may have thee back and take thee away with me: and he is
 so good as to surrender thee on my own terms?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02100025"/>The lady turned
 to him with a slight smile, and said: <q>Is it to me you speak, Sir?
 Bethink you that you may have mistaken me for another, for I, for
 my part, do not remember ever to have seen you.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02100026"/><q>Nay,</q> said
 Messer Ricciardo, <q>but bethink thee what thou sayst; scan me
 closely; and if thou wilt but search thy memory, thou wilt find that
 I am thy Ricciardo di Chinzica.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02100027"/><q>Your pardon, Sir,</q> answered
 the lady, <q>'tis not, perhaps, as seemly for me, as you imagine, to
 gaze long upon you; but I have gazed long enough to know that I
 never saw you before.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02100028"/>Messer Ricciardo supposed that she so spoke
 for fear of Paganino, in whose presence she durst not acknowledge
 that she knew him: so, after a while, he craved as a favour of
 Paganino that he might speak with her in a room alone. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02100029"/>Which
 request Paganino granted, so only that he did not kiss her against her
 will. He then bade the lady go with Messer Ricciardo into a room
 apart, and hear what he had to say, and give him such answer as she
 deemed meet. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02100030"/>So the lady and Messer Ricciardo went together into
 a room alone, and sate down, and Messer Ricciardo began on this
 wise: <q>Ah! dear heart of me, sweet soul of me, hope of me, dost
 not recognise thy Ricciardo that loves thee better than himself?
 how comes it thus to pass? am I then so changed? Ah! goodly
 eye of me, do but look on me a little.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02100031"/>Whereat the lady burst into
 a laught, and interrupting him, said: <q>Rest assured that my memory
 is not so short but that I know you for what you are, my husband,
 Messer Ricciardo di Chinzica; but far enough you shewed yourself
 to be, while I was with you, from knowing me for what I was,
 young, lusty, lively; which, had you been the wise man you would
 fain be reputed, you would not have ignored, nor by consequence
 that which, besides food and clothing, it behoves men to give young
 ladies, albeit for shame they demand it not; which in what sort you
 gave, you know. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02100032"/>You should not have taken a wife if she was to
 be less to you than the study of the law, albeit 'twas never as a judge
 that I regarded you, but rather as a bellman of encænia and saints'
 days, so well you knew them all, and fasts and vigils. And I tell
 you that, had you imposed the observance of as many saints' days on
 <pb n="169"/>the labourers that till your lands as on yourself who had but my little
 plot to till, you would never have harvested a single grain of corn.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02100033"/>God in His mercy, having regard unto my youth, has caused me to
 fall in with this gentleman, with whom I am much closeted in this
 room, where nought is known of feasts, such feasts, I mean, as you,
 more devoted to the service of God than to the service of ladies, were
 wont to observe in such profusion; nor was this threshold ever
 crossed by Saturday or Friday or vigil or Ember-days or Lent, that
 is so long; rather here we are at work day and night, threshing the
 wool, and well I know how featly it went when the matin bell last
 sounded. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02100034"/>Wherefore with him I mean to stay, and to work while
 I am young, and postpone the observance of feasts and times of
 indulgence and fasts until I am old: so get you hence, and good luck
 go with you, but depart with what speed you may, and observe as
 many feasts as you like, so I be not with you.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02100035"/>The pain with which Messer Ricciardo followed this outburst
 was more than he could bear, and when she had done, he exclaimed:
 <q>Ah! sweet soul of me, what words are these that thou
 utterest? Hast thou no care for thy parents' honour and thine
 own? Wilt thou remain here to be this man's harlot, and to live
 in mortal sin, rather than live with me at <placeName>Pisa</placeName>as my wife? Why,
 when he is tired of thee, he will cast thee out to thy most grievous
 dishonour. I will ever cherish thee, and ever, will I nill I, thou
 wilt be the mistress of my house. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02100036"/>Wouldst thou, to gratify this
 unbridled and unseemly passion, part at once with thy honour and
 with me, who love thee more dearly than my very life? Ah!
 cherished hope of me, say not so again: make up thy mind to come
 with me. As I now know thy bent, I will henceforth constrain
 myself to pleasure thee: wherefore, sweet my treasure, think better
 of it, and come with me, who have never known a happy hour since
 thou wert reft from me.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02100037"/>The lady answered: <q>I expect not, nor
 is it possible, that another should be more tender of my honour than
 I am myself. Were my parents so, when they gave me to you? I
 trow not; nor mean I to be more tender of their honour now than
 they were then of mine. And if now I live in mortar sin, I will
 ever abide there until it be pestle sin:<note>A poor jeu de mots, mortaio,
 mortar, being substituted for mortale.</note> concern yourself no further
 <pb n="170"/>on my account. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02100038"/>Moreover, let me tell you, that, whereas at <placeName>Pisa</placeName> 'twas as if I were your harlot, seeing that the planets in conjunction
 according to lunar mansion and geometric square intervened between
 you and me, here with Paganino I deem myself a wife, for he holds
 me in his arms all night long and hugs and bites me, and how he
 serves me, God be my witness. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02100039"/>Ah! but you say you will constrain
 yourself to serve me: to what end? to do it on the third essay,
 and raise it by stroke of bâton? I doubt not you are become a
 perfect knight since last I saw you. Begone, and constrain yourself
 to live; for here, methinks, your tenure is but precarious, so hectic
 and wasted is your appearance. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02100040"/>Nay more; I tell you this, that,
 should Paganino desert me (which he does not seem disposed to do
 so long as I am willing to stay with him), never will I return to
 your house, where for one while I staid to my most grievous loss
 and prejudice, but will seek my commodity elsewhere, than with
 one from whose whole body I could not wring a single cupful of sap.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02100041"/>So, again, I tell you that here is neither feast nor vigil; wherefore
 here I mean to abide; and you, get you gone, in God's name with
 what speed you may, lest I raise the cry that you threaten to
 violate me.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02100042"/>Messer Ricciardo felt himself hard bested, but he could not but
 recognise that, worn out as he was, he had been foolish to take a
 young wife; so sad and woebegone he quitted the room, and, after
 expending on Paganino a wealth of words which signified nothing,
 he at last gave up his bootless enterprise, and leaving the lady to her
 own devices, returned to <placeName>Pisa</placeName>; where for very grief he lapsed into
 such utter imbecility that, when he was met by any with greeting or
 question in the street, he made no other answer than <q>the evil hole
 brooks no holiday,</q> and soon afterwards died. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02100043"/>Which when Paganino
 learned, being well assured of the love the lady bore him, he made
 her his lawful wife; and so, keeping neither feast nor vigil nor Lent,
 they worked as hard as their legs permitted, and had a good time.
 Wherefore, dear my ladies, I am of opinion that Messer Bernabò in
 his altercation with Ambrogiuolo rode the goat downhill.<note><!--(i)-->I. e.<!--(/i)-->
 argued preposterously, the goat being the last animal to carry a
 rider comfortably downhill.</note></p></div><!--*******************************Conclusion*****************************--><div type="conclusion" corresp="d02conclu"><head>Conclusion</head><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02970001"/>This story provoked so much laughter that the jaws of every one
 in the company ached; and all the ladies by common consent
 <pb n="171"/>acknowledged that <persName>Dioneo</persName> was right, and pronounced Bernabò a
 blockhead. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02970002"/>But when the story was ended and the laughter had
 subsided, the queen, observing that the hour was now late, and that
 with the completion of the day's story-telling the end of her
 sovereignty was come, followed the example of her predecessor, and
 took off her wreath and set it on <persName>Neifile</persName>'s brow, saying with gladsome
 mien, <q>Now, dear gossip, thine be the sovereignty of this little
	people;</q> and so she resumed her seat. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02970003"/><persName>Neifile</persName> coloured somewhat
 to receive such honour, shewing of aspect even as the fresh-blown
 rose of April or May in the radiance of the dawn, her eyes rather
 downcast, and glowing with love's fire like the morning-star. But
 when the respectful murmur, by which the rest of the company gave
 blithe token of the favour in which they held their queen, was
 hushed, and her courage revived, she raised herself somewhat more
 in her seat than she was wont, and thus spoke: 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02970004"/><q>As so it is that
 I am your queen, I purpose not to depart from the usage observed
 by my predecessors, whose rule has commanded not only your
 obedience but your approbation. I will therefore in few words
 explain to you the course which, if it commend itself to your
 wisdom, we will follow. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02970005"/>To-morrow, you know, is Friday, and the
 next day Saturday, days which most folk find somewhat wearisome
 by reason of the viands which are then customary, to say nothing of
 the reverence in which Friday is meet to be held, seeing that 'twas
 on that day that He who died for us bore His passion; wherefore
 'twould be in my judgment both right and very seemly, if, in honour
 of God, we then bade story-telling give place to prayer. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02970006"/>On
 Saturday ladies are wont to wash the head, and rid their persons of
 whatever of dust or other soilure they may have gathered by the
 labours of the past week; not a few, likewise, are wont to practise
 abstinence for devotion to the Virgin Mother of the Son of God,
 and to honour the approaching Sunday by an entire surcease from
 work. Wherefore, as we cannot then completely carry out our
 plan of life, we shall, I think, do well to intermit our story-telling
 on that day also. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02970007"/>We shall then have been here four days; and
 lest we should be surprised by new-comers, I deem it expedient that
 we shift our quarters, and I have already taken thought for our next
 place of sojourn. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02970008"/>Where, being arrived on Sunday, we will assemble
 after our sleep; and, whereas to-day our discourse has had an ample
 <pb n="172"/>field to range in, I propose, both because you will thereby have more
 time for thought, and it will be best to set some limits to the license
 of our story-telling, that of the many diversities of Fortune's handiwork
 we make one our theme, whereof I have also made choice, 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02970009"/>to
 wit, the luck of such as have painfully acquired some much-coveted
 thing, or having lost, have recovered it. Whereon let each meditate
 some matter, which to tell may be profitable or at least delectable to
 the company, saving always <persName>Dioneo</persName>'s privilege.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02970010"/>All applauded the queen's speech and plan, to which, therefore,
 it was decided to give effect. Thereupon the queen called her
 seneschal, told him where to place the tables that evening, and then
 explained to him all that he had to do during the time of her
 sovereignty. This done, she rose with her train, and gave leave to
 all to take their pleasure as to each might seem best. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02970011"/>So the ladies
 and the men hied them away to a little garden, where they diverted
 themselves a while; then supper-time being come, they supped with
 all gay and festal cheer. When they were risen from the table,
 <persName>Emilia</persName>, at the queen's command, led the dance, while <persName>Pampinea</persName>,
 the other ladies responding, sang the ensuing song.</p><floatingText type="song"><body><lg><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02970012"/><l>Shall any lady sing, if I not sing,</l><l>I to whom Love did full contentment bring?</l></lg><lg><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02970013"/><l>Come hither, Love, thou cause of all my joy,</l><l>Of all my hope, and all its sequel blest,</l><l>And with me tune the lay,</l><l>No more to sighs and bitter past annoy,</l><l>That now but serve to lend thy bliss more zest;</l><l>But to that fire's clear ray,</l><l>Wherewith enwrapt I blithely live and gay,</l><l>Thee as my God for ever worshipping.</l></lg><lg><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02970014"/><l>'Twas thou, O Love, didst set before mine eyes,</l><l>When first thy fire my sould did penetrate,</l><l>A youth to be my fere,</l><l>So fair, so fit for deeds of high emprise,</l><l>That ne'er another shall be found more great,</l><l>Nay, nor, I ween, his peer:</l><l>Such flame he kindled that my heart's full cheer</l><l>I now pour out in chant with thee, my King.</l></lg><pb n="173"/><lg><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p02970015"/><l>And that wherein I most delight is this,</l><l>That as I love him, so he loveth me:</l><l>So thank thee, Love, I must.</l><l>For whatsoe'er this world can yield of bliss</l><l>Is mine, and in the next at peace to be</l><l>I hope through that full trust</l><l>I place in him.

      of divers sorts of music; after which, the queen deeming it time to
      go to rest, all, following in the wake of the torches, sought their
      several chambers. The next two days they devoted to the duties

 orange, as the sun hasted to the horizon, when the queen rose and
 roused all the company. The seneschal had early sent forward to
 their next place of sojourn ample store of things meet with folk to
 make all things ready, and now seeing the queen on the road, and
 the decampment, as it were, begun, he hastily completed the equipment
 of the baggage-train, and set off therewith, attended by the
      rest of the servants, in rear of the ladies and gentlemen. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03980003"/>So, to the
 chant of, perhaps, a score of nightingales and other birds, the queen,
 her ladies and the three young men trooping beside or after her,
 paced leisurely westward by a path little frequented and overgrown
 with herbage and flowers, which, as they caught the sunlight, began
 one and all to unfold their petals. So fared she on with her train,
 while the quirk and the jest and the laugh passed from mouth to
 mouth; nor had they completed more than two thousand paces
 when, well before half tierce,<note><!--(i)-->I. e.<!--(/i)--> midway between prime and
 tierce, about 7.30 a.m.</note> they arrived at a palace most fair
 and sumptuous, which stood out somewhat from the plain, being
 situate upon a low eminence. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03980004"/>On entering, they first traversed its
 great halls and dainty chambers furnished throughout with all brave
 and meet appointments; and finding all most commendable, they
 reputed its lord a magnifico. Then descending, they surveyed its
 spacious and cheerful court, its vaults of excellent wines and copious
 springs of most cool water, and found it still more commendable.
 After which, being fain of rest, they sat them down in a gallery
 <pb n="175"/>which commanded the court, and was close imbosked with leafage
 and such flowers as the season afforded, and thither the discreet
 seneschal brought comfits and wines most choice and excellent,
 wherewith they were refreshed. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03980005"/>Whereupon they hied them to a
 walled garden adjoining the palace; which, the gate being opened,
 they entered, and wonder-struck by the beauty of the whole passed
 on to examine more attentively the several parts. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03980006"/>It was bordered
 and traversed in many parts by alleys, each very wide and straight as
 an arrow and roofed in with trellis of vines, which gave good promise
 of bearing clusters that year, and, being all in flower, dispersed such
 fragrance throughout the garden as blended with that exhaled by
 many another plant that grew therein made the garden seem
 redolent of all the spices that ever grew in the East. The sides of
 the alleys were all, as it were, walled in with roses white and red
 and jasmine; insomuch that there was no part of the garden but one
 might walk there not merely in the morning but at high noon in
 grateful shade and fragrance, completely screened from the sun. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03980007"/>As
 for the plants that were in the garden, 'twere long to enumerate
 them, to specify their sorts, to describe the order of their arrangement;
 enough, in brief, that there was abundance of every rarer species that
 our climate allows. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03980008"/>In the middle of the garden, a thing not less
 but much more to be commended than aught else, was a lawn of
 the finest turf, and so green that it seemed almost black, pranked with
 flowers of, perhaps, a thousand sorts, and girt about with the richest
 living verdure of orange-trees and cedars, which shewed not only
 flowers but fruits both new and old, and were no less grateful to the
 smell by their fragrance than to the eye by their shade. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03980009"/>In the
 middle of the lawn was a basin of whitest marble, graven with
 marvellous art; in the centre whereof--whether the spring were
 natural or artificial I know not--rose a column supporting a figure
 which sent forth a jet of water of such volume and to such an
 altitude that it fell, not without a delicious plash, into the basin in
 quantity amply sufficient to turn a mill-wheel. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03980010"/>The overflow was
 carried away from the lawn by a hidden conduit, and then, reemerging,
 was distributed through tiny channels, very fair and
 cunningly contrived, in such sort as to flow round the entire lawn,
 and by similar derivative channels to penetrate almost every part of
 the fair garden, until, re-uniting at a certain point, it issued thence,
 <pb n="176"/>and, clear as crystal, slid down towards the plain, turning by the way
 two mill-wheels with extreme velocity to the no small profit of the
 lord. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03980011"/>The aspect of this garden, its fair order, the plants and the
 fountain and the rivulets that flowed from it, so charmed the ladies
 and the three young men that with one accord they affirmed that
 they knew not how it could receive any accession of beauty, or what
 other form could be given to Paradise, if it were to be planted on
 earth. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03980012"/>So, excellently well pleased, they roved about it, plucking
 sprays from the trees, and weaving them into the fairest of garlands,
 while songsters of, perhaps, a score of different sorts warbled as if in
 mutual emulation, when suddenly a sight as fair and delightsome as
 novel, which, engrossed by the other beauties of the place, they had
 hitherto overlooked, met their eyes. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03980013"/>For the garden, they now saw,
 was peopled with a host of living creatures, fair and of, perhaps, a
 hundred sorts; and they pointed out to one another how here
 emerged a cony, or there scampered a hare, or couched a goat, or
 grazed a fawn, or many another harmless, all but domesticated,
 creature roved carelessly seeking his pleasure at his own sweet will.
 All which served immensely to reinforce their already abundant
 delight. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03980014"/>At length, however, they had enough of wandering about
 the garden and observing this thing and that: wherefore they
 repaired to the beautiful fountain, around which were ranged the
 tables, and there, after they had sung half-a-dozen songs and trod
 some measures, they sat them down, at the queen's command, to
 breakfast, which was served with all celerity and in fair and orderly
 manner, the viands being both good and delicate; whereby their
 spirits rose, and up they got, and betook themselves again to music
 and song and dance, and so sped the hours, until, as the heat increased,
 the queen deemed it time that whoso was so minded should go to
 sleep. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03980015"/>Some there were that did so; others were too charmed by
 the beauty of the place to think of leaving it; but tarried there, and,
 while the rest slept, amused themselves with reading romances or
 playing at chess or dice. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03980016"/>However, after none, there was a general
 <!--(i)-->levèe;<!--(/i)--> and, with faces laved and refreshed with cold water,
 they
 gathered by the queen's command upon the lawn, and, having sat
 them down in their wonted order by the fountain, waited for the
 story-telling to begin upon the theme assigned by the queen. With
 this duty the queen first charged <persName>Filostrato</persName>, who began on this wise.</p></div><pb n="177"/><!--***********************************Novella 1*********************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0301"><head>Novel I</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03010001"/><!--(i)-->Masetto da <placeName>Lamporecchio</placeName> feigns to be dumb, and obtains

 women of great repute for sanctity--name it I will not, lest I should
 in some measure diminish its repute--the nuns being at the time of
 which I speak but nine in number, including the abbess, and all
 young women. Their very beautiful garden was in charge of a
 foolish fellow, who, not being content with his wage, squared
 <pb n="178"/>accounts with their steward, and hied him back to <placeName>Lamporecchio</placeName>,
 whence he came. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03010007"/>Among others who welcomed him home was a
 young husbandman, Masetto by name, a stout and hardy fellow, and
 handsome for a contadino, who asked him where he had been so
 long. Nuto, as our good friend was called, told him. Masetto
 then asked how he had been employed at the convent, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03010008"/>and Nuto
 answered: <q>I kept their large and beautiful garden in good trim,
 and, besides, I sometimes went to the wood to fetch the faggots, I
 drew water, and did some other trifling services; but the ladies gave
 so little wage that it scarce kept me in shoes. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03010009"/>And moreover they
 are all young, and, I think, they are one and all possessed of the
 devil, for 'tis impossible to do anything to their mind; indeed, when
 I would be at work in the kitchen-garden, 'put this here,' would say
 one, 'put that here,' would say another, and a third would snatch
 the hoe from my hand, and say, 'that is not as it should be'; and
 so they would worry me until I would give up working and go out
 of the garden; so that, what with this thing and that, I was minded
 to stay there no more, and so I am come hither. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03010010"/>The steward asked
 me before I left to send him any one whom on my return I might
 find fit for the work, and I promised; but God bless his loins, I
 shall be at no pains to find out and send him any one.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03010011"/>As Nuto thus ran on, Masetto was seized by such a desire to be
 with these nuns that he quite pined, as he gathered from what Nuto
 said that his desire might be gratified. And as that could not be,
 if he said nothing to Nuto, he remarked: <q>Ah! 'twas well done
 of thee to come hither. A man to live with women! he might as
 well live with so many devils: six times out of seven they know not
 themselves what they want.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03010012"/>There the conversation ended; but
 Masetto began to cast about how he should proceed to get permission
 to live with them. He knew that he was quite competent for the
 services of which Nuto spoke, and had therefore no fear of failing on
 that score; but he doubted he should not be received, because he was
 too young and well-favoured. So, after much pondering, he fell into
 the following train of thought: The place is a long way off, and no
 one there knows me; if I make believe that I am dumb, doubtless
 I shall be admitted. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03010013"/>Whereupon he made his mind up, laid a
 hatchet across his shoulder, and saying not a word to any of his
 destination, set forth, intending to present himself at the convent
 <pb n="179"/>in the character of a destitute man. Arrived there, he had no
 sooner entered than he chanced to encounter the steward in the
 courtyard, and making signs to him as dumb folk do, he let him
 know that of his charity he craved something to eat, and that, if
 need were, he would split firewood. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03010014"/>The steward promptly gave
 him to eat, and then set before him some logs which Nuto had not
 been able to split, all which Masetto, who was very strong, split
 in a very short time. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03010015"/>The steward, having occasion to go to the
 wood, took him with him, and there set him at work on the lopping;
 which done he placed the ass in front of him, and by signs made him
 understand that he was to take the loppings back to the convent.
 This he did so well that the steward kept him for some days to do
 one or two odd jobs. Whereby it so befell that one day the abbess
 saw him, and asked the steward who he was. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03010016"/><q>Madam,</q> replied
 the steward, <q>'tis a poor deaf mute that came here a day or two
 ago craving alms, so I have treated him kindly, and have let him
 make himself useful in many ways. If he knew how to do the work
 of the kitchen-garden and would stay with us, I doubt not we should
 be well served; for we have need of him, and he is strong, and would
 be able for whatever he might turn his hand to; besides which you
 would have no cause to be apprehensive lest he should be cracking
 his jokes with your young women.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03010017"/><q>As I trust in God,</q> said the
 abbess, <q>thou sayst sooth; find out if he can do the garden work,
 and if he can, do all thou canst to keep him with us; give him a
 pair of shoes, an old hood, and speak him well, make much of him,
 and let him be well fed.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03010018"/>All which the steward promised to do.</p><p>Masetto, meanwhile, was close at hand, making as if he were
 sweeping the courtyard, and heard all that passed between the abbess
 and the steward, whereat he gleefully communed with himself on
 this wise: Put me once within there, and you will see that I will
 do the work of the kitchen-garden as it never was done before. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03010019"/>So
 the steward set him to work in the kitchen-garden, and finding that
 he knew his business excellently well, made signs to him to know
 whether he would stay, and he made answer by signs that he was
 ready to do whatever the steward wished. The steward then signified
 that he was engaged, told him to take charge of the kitchen-garden,
 and shewed him what he had to do there. Then, having other
 matters to attend to, he went away, and left him there. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03010020"/>Now, as
 <pb n="180"/>Masetto worked there day by day, the nuns began to tease him, and
 make him their butt (as it commonly happens that folk serve the
 dumb) and used bad language to him, the worst they could think of,
 supposing that he could not understand them: all which passed
 scarce heeded by the abbess, who perhaps deemed him as destitute
 of virility as of speech. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03010021"/>Now it so befell that after a hard day's
 work he was taking a little rest, when two young nuns, who were
 walking in the garden, approached the spot where he lay, and stopped
 to look at him, while he pretended to be asleep. And so the bolder
 of the two said to the other: <q>If I thought thou wouldst keep the
 secret, I would tell thee what I have sometimes meditated, and which
 thou perhaps mightest also find agreeable.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03010022"/>The other replied:
 <q>Speak thy mind freely and be sure that I will never tell a soul.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03010023"/>Whereupon the bold one began: <q>I know not if thou hast ever
 considered how close we are kept here, and that within these precincts
 dare never enter any man, unless it be the old steward or
 this mute: and I have often heard from ladies that have come hither,
 that all the other sweets that the world has to offer signify not a jot
 in comparison of the pleasure that a woman has in connexion with
 a man. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03010024"/>Whereof I have more than once been minded to make
 experiment with this mute, no other man being available. Nor,
 indeed, could one find any man in the whole world so meet therefor;
 seeing that he could not blab if he would; thou seest that he is but
 a dull clownish lad, whose size has increased out of all proportion

 it.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03010025"/><q>Alas!</q> said the other, <q>what is 't thou sayst? Knowest
 thou not that we have vowed our virginity to God?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03010026"/><q>Oh,</q>
 rejoined the first, <q>think but how many vows are made to Him
 all day long, and never a one performed: and so, for our vow, let
 Him find another or others to perform it.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03010027"/><q>But,</q> said her companion,
 <q>suppose that we conceived, how then?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03010028"/><q>Nay but,</q>
 protested the first, <q>thou goest about to imagine evil before it befalls
 thee: time enough to think of that when it comes to pass; there
 will be a thousand ways to prevent its ever being known, so only
 we do not publish it ourselves.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03010029"/>Thus reassured, the other was now
 the more eager of the two to test the quality of the male human
 animal. <q>Well then,</q> she said, <q>how shall we go about it?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03010030"/>and
 was answered: <q>Thou seest 'tis past none; I make no doubt but
 <pb n="181"/>all the sisters are asleep, except ourselves; search we through the
 kitchen-garden, to see if there be any there, and if there be none,
 we have but to take him by the hand and lead him hither to the
 hut where he takes shelter from the rain; and then one shall
 mount guard while the other has him with her inside. He is such
 a simpleton that he will do just whatever we bid him.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03010031"/>No word
 of this conversation escaped Masetto, who, being disposed to obey,
 hoped for nothing so much as that one of them should take him
 by the hand. They, meanwhile, looked carefully all about them,
 and satisfied themselves that they were secure from observation:
 then she that had broached the subject came close up to Masetto,
 and shook him; whereupon he started to his feet. So she took
 him by the hand with a blandishing air, to which he replied with
 some clownish grins. And then she led him into the hut, where
 he needed no pressing to do what she desired of him. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03010032"/>Which done,
 she changed places with the other, as loyal comradeship required;
 and Masetto, still keeping up the pretence of simplicity, did their
 pleasure. Wherefore before they left, each must needs make another
 assay of the mute's powers of riding; and afterwards, talking the
 matter over many times, they agreed that it was in truth not less
 but even more delightful than they had been given to understand;
 and so, as they found convenient opportunity, they continued to go
 and disport themselves with the mute.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03010033"/>Now it so chanced that one of their gossips, looking out of the
 window of her cell, saw what they did, and imparted it to two
 others. The three held counsel together whether they should not
 denounce the offenders to the abbess, but soon changed their mind,
 and came to an understanding with them, whereby they became
 partners in Masetto. And in course of time by divers chances the
 remaining three nuns also entered the partnership. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03010034"/>Last of all the
 abbess, still witting nought of these doings, happened one very hot
 day, as she walked by herself through the garden, to find Masetto,
 who now rode so much by night that he could stand very little
 fatigue by day, stretched at full length asleep under the shade of
 an almond-tree, his person quite exposed in front by reason that the
 wind had disarranged his clothes. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03010035"/>Which the lady observing, and
 knowing that she was alone, fell a prey to the same appetite to
 which her nuns had yielded: she aroused Masetto, and took him
 <pb n="182"/>with her to her chamber, where, for some days, though the nuns
 loudly complained that the gardener no longer came to work in the
 kitchen-garden, she kept him, tasting and re-tasting the sweetness
 of that indulgence which she was wont to be the first to censure
 in others. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03010036"/>And when at last she had sent him back from her
 chamber to his room, she must needs send for him again and again,
 and made such exorbitant demands upon him, that Masetto, not being
 able to satisfy so many women, bethought him that his part of mute,
 should he persist in it, might entail disastrous consequences. So one
 night, when he was with the abbess, he cut the tongue-string, and
 thus broke silence: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03010037"/><q>Madam, I have understood that a cock may
 very well serve ten hens, but that ten men are sorely tasked to satisfy
 a single woman; and here am I expected to serve nine, a burden
 quite beyond my power to bear; nay, by what I have already undergone
 I am now so reduced that my strength is quite spent; wherefore
 either bid me Godspeed, or find some means to make matters
 tolerable.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03010038"/>Wonder-struck to hear the supposed mute thus speak, the
 lady exclaimed: <q>What means this? I took thee to be dumb.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03010039"/><q>And in sooth, Madam, so was I,</q> said Masetto, <q>not indeed from
 my birth, but through an illness which took from me the power
 of speech, which only this very night have I recovered; and so I
 praise God with all my heart.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03010040"/>The lady believed him; and asked
 him what he meant by saying that he had nine to serve. Masetto
 told her how things stood; whereby she perceived that of all her
 nuns there was not any but was much wiser than she; and lest,
 if Masetto were sent away, he should give the convent a bad name,
 she discreetly determined to arrange matters with the nuns in such
 sort that he might remain there. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03010041"/>So, the steward having died
 within the last few days, she assembled all the nuns; and their and
 her own past errors being fully avowed, they by common consent,
 and with Masetto's concurrence, resolved that the neighbours should
 be given to understand that by their prayers and the merits of their
 patron saint, Masetto, long mute, had recovered the power of speech;
 after which they made him steward, and so ordered matters among
 themselves that he was able to endure the burden of their service. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03010042"/>In
 the course of which, though he procreated not a few little monastics,
 yet 'twas all managed so discreetly that no breath of scandal stirred,
 until after the abbess's death, by which time Masetto was advanced
 <pb n="183"/>in years and minded to return home with the wealth that he had
 gotten; which he was suffered to do as soon as he made his desire
 known. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03010043"/>And so Masetto, who had left <placeName>Lamporecchio</placeName> with a
 hatchet on his shoulder, returned thither in his old age rich and
 a father, having by the wisdom with which he employed his youth,
 spared himself the pains and expense of rearing children, and
 averring that such was the measure that Christ meted out to the
 man that set horns on his cap.</p></div><pb n="184"/><!--***********************************Novella 2*********************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0302"><head>Novel II</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03020001"/><!--(i)-->A groom lies with the wife of King Agilulf, who learns

 the city of <placeName>Pavia</placeName> in <placeName>Lombardy</placeName> the seat of his government, took
 to wife Theodelinde, the widow of Authari, likewise King of the
 Lombards, a lady very fair, wise and virtuous, but who was
      unfortunate in her lover. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03020005"/>For while the Lombards prospered in
 peace under the wise and firm rule of King Agilulf, it so befell
 that one of the Queen's grooms, a man born to very low estate,
 but in native worth far above his mean office, and moreover not
 a whit less tall and goodly of person than the King, became
 inordinately enamoured of her. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03020006"/>And as, for all his base condition,
 he had sense enough to recognize that his love was in the last
 <pb n="185"/>degree presumptuous, he disclosed it to none, nay, he did not even
 venture to tell her the tale by the mute eloquence of his eyes.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03020007"/>And albeit he lived without hope that he should ever be able to
 win her favour, yet he inwardly gloried that he had fixed his
 affections in so high a place; and being all aflame with passion,
 he shewed himself zealous beyond any of his comrades to do whatever
 he thought was likely to please the Queen. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03020008"/>Whereby it came
 about, that, when the Queen had to take horse, she would mount
 the palfrey that he groomed rather than any other; and when she
 did so, he deemed himself most highly favoured, and never quitted
 her stirrup, esteeming himself happy if he might but touch her
 clothes. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03020009"/>But as 'tis frequently observed that love waxes as hope
 wanes, so was it with this poor groom, insomuch that the burden
 of this great hidden passion, alleviated by no hope, was most grievous
 to bear, and from time to time, not being able to shake it off, he
 purposed to die. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03020010"/>And meditating on the mode, he was minded
 that it should be of a kind to make it manifest that he died for the
 love which he had borne and bore to the Queen, and also to afford
 him an opportunity of trying his fortune whether his desire might
 in whole or in part be gratified. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03020011"/>He had no thought of speaking
 to the Queen, nor yet of declaring his love to her by letter, for he
 knew that 'twould be vain either to speak or to write; but he
 resolved to try to devise some means whereby he might lie with
 the Queen; which end might in no other way be compassed than
 by contriving to get access to her in her bedroom; which could
 only be by passing himself off as the King, who, as he knew, did
 not always lie with her. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03020012"/>Wherefore, that he might observe the
 carriage and dress of the King as he passed to her room, he contrived
 to conceal himself for several nights in a great hall of the
 King's palace which separated the King's room from that of the
 Queen: and on one of these nights he saw the King issue from
 his room, wrapped in a great mantle, with a lighted torch in one
 hand and a wand in the other, and cross the hall, and, saying
 nothing, tap the door of the Queen's room with the wand once
 or twice; whereupon the door was at once opened and the torch
 taken from his hand. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03020013"/>Having observed the King thus go and
 return, and being bent on doing likewise, he found means to come
 by a mantle like that which he had seen the King wear, and also
 <pb n="186"/>a torch and a wand: he then took a warm bath, and having
 thoroughly cleansed himself, that the smell of the foul straw might
 not offend the lady, or discover to her the deceit, he in this guise
 concealed himself as he was wont in the great hall. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03020014"/>He waited
 only until all were asleep, and then, deeming the time come to
 accomplish his purpose, or by his presumption clear a way to the death
 which he coveted, he struck a light with the flint and steel which he
 had brought with him; and having kindled his torch and wrapped
 himself close in his mantle, he went to the door of the Queen's
 room, and tapped on it twice with his wand. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03020015"/>The door was opened
 by a very drowsy chambermaid, who took the torch and put it out
 of sight; whereupon without a word he passed within the curtain,
 laid aside the mantle, and got into the bed where the Queen lay
 asleep. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03020016"/>Then, taking her in his arms and straining her to him
 with ardour, making as if he were moody, because he knew that,
 when the King was in such a frame, he would never hear aught,
 in such wise, without word said either on his part or on hers,
 he had more than once carnal cognizance of the Queen. Loath
 indeed was he to leave her, but, fearing lest by too long tarrying
 his achieved delight might be converted into woe, he rose, resumed
 the mantle and the light, and leaving the room without a word,
 returned with all speed to his bed. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03020017"/>He was hardly there when the
 King got up and entered the Queen's room; whereat she wondered
 not a little; but, reassured by the gladsome greeting which he gave
 her as he got into bed, she said: <q>My lord, what a surprise is this
 to-night! 'Twas but now you left me after an unwonted measure
 of enjoyment, and do you now return so soon? consider what you
 do.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03020018"/>From these words the King at once inferred that the Queen
 had been deceived by some one that had counterfeited his person
 and carriage; but, at the same time, bethinking himself that, as
 neither the Queen nor any other had detected the cheat, 'twas
 best to leave her in ignorance, he wisely kept silence. Which
 many a fool would not have done, but would have said: <q>Nay,
 'twas not I that was here. Who was it that was here? How
 came it to pass? Who came hither?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03020019"/>Whereby in the sequel
 he might have caused the lady needless chagrin, and given her
 occasion to desire another such experience as she had had; and
 so have brought disgrace upon himself by uttering that, from which,
 <pb n="187"/>unuttered, no shame could have resulted. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03020020"/>Wherefore, betraying
 little, either by his mien or by his words, of the disquietude which
 he felt, the King replied: <q>Madam, seem I such to you that you
 cannot suppose that I should have been with you once, and returned
 to you immediately afterwards?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03020021"/><q>Nay, not so, my lord,</q> returned
 the lady, <q>but none the less I pray you to look to your health.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03020022"/>Then said the King: <q>And I am minded to take your advice;
 wherefore, without giving you further trouble I will leave you.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03020023"/>So, angered and incensed beyond measure by the trick which, he
 saw, had been played upon him, he resumed his mantle and quitted
 the room with the intention of privily detecting the offender,
 deeming that he must belong to the palace, and that, whoever he
 might be, he could not have quitted it. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03020024"/>So, taking with him a
 small lantern which shewed only a glimmer of light, he went into
 the dormitory which was over the palace-stables and was of great
 length, insomuch that well-nigh all the men-servants slept there
 in divers beds, and arguing that, by whomsoever that of which the
 Queen spoke was done, his heart and pulse could not after such
 a strain as yet have ceased to throb, he began cautiously with one
 of the head-grooms, and so went from bed to bed feeling at the
 heart of each man to see if it was thumping. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03020025"/>All were asleep,
 save only he that had been with the Queen, who, seeing the King
 come, and guessing what he sought to discover, began to be mightily
 afraid, insomuch that to the agitation which his late exertion had
 communicated to his heart, terror now added one yet more violent;
 nor did he doubt that, should the King perceive it, he would kill
 him. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03020026"/>Divers alternatives of action thronged his mind; but at last,
 observing that the King was unarmed, he resolved to make as if
 he were asleep, and wait to see what the King would do. So,
 having tried many and found none that he deemed the culprit, the
 King came at last to the culprit himself, and marking the thumping
 of his heart, said to himself: This is he. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03020027"/>But being minded to afford
 no clue to his ulterior purpose, he did no more than with a pair of
 scissors which he had brought with him shear away on one side
 of the man's head a portion of his locks, which, as was then the
 fashion, he wore very long, that by this token he might recognize
 him on the morrow; and having so done, he departed and returned
 to his room. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03020028"/>The groom, who was fully sensible of what the King
 <pb n="188"/>had done, and being a shrewd fellow understood very well to what
 end he was so marked, got up without a moment's delay; and,
 having found a pair of scissors--for, as it chanced, there were several
 pairs there belonging to the stables for use in grooming the horses--he
 went quietly through the dormitory and in like manner sheared
 the locks of each of the sleepers just above the ear; which done
 without disturbing any, he went back to bed.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03020029"/>On the morrow, as soon as the King was risen, and before the
 gates of the palace were opened, he summoned all his men-servants to
 his presence, and, as they stood bareheaded before him, scanned them
 closely to see whether the one whom he had sheared was there; and
 observing with surprise that the more part of them were all sheared
 in the same manner, said to himself: Of a surety this fellow, whom
 I go about to detect, evinces, for all his base condition, a high degree
 of sense. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03020030"/>Then, recognising that he could not compass his end
 without causing a bruit, and not being minded to brave so great a
 dishonour in order to be avenged upon so petty an offender, he was
 content by a single word of admonition to shew him that his offence
 had not escaped notice. Wherefore turning to them all, he said:
 <q>He that did it, let him do it no more, and get you hence in God's
 peace.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03020031"/>Another would have put them to the strappado, the question,
 the torture, and thereby have brought to light that which one should
 rather be sedulous to cloak; and having so brought it to light, would,
 however complete the retribution which he exacted, have not
 lessened but vastly augmented his disgrace, and sullied the fair fame
 of his lady. Those who heard the King's parting admonition
 wondered, and made much question with one another, what the
 King might have meant to convey by it; but 'twas understood by
 none but him to whom it referred: who was discreet enough never to
 reveal the secret as long as the King lived, or again to stake his life
 on such a venture.</p></div><pb n="189"/><!--***********************************Novella 3*********************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0303"><head>Novel III</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030001"/><!--(i)-->Under cloak of confession and a most spotless conscience,

 faith, there dwelt, not many years ago, a gentlewoman richly
 endowed (none more so) by nature with physical charms, as also
 with gracious manners, high spirit and fine discernment. Her name
 <pb n="190"/>I know, but will not disclose it, nor yet that of any other who
 figures in this story, because there yet live those who might take
 offence thereat, though after all it might well be passed off with a
 laugh. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030006"/>High-born and married to an artificer of woollen fabrics, she
 could not rid her mind of the disdain with which, by reason of his
 occupation, she regarded her husband; for no man, however wealthy,
 so he were of low condition, seemed to her worthy to have a gentlewoman
 to wife; and seeing that for all his wealth he was fit for
 nothing better than to devise a blend, set up a warp, or higgle about
 yarn with a spinster, she determined to dispense with his embraces,
 save so far as she might find it impossible to refuse them; and to find
 her satisfaction elsewhere with one that seemed to her more meet to
 afford it than her artificer of woollens. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030007"/>In this frame of mind she
 became enamoured of a man well worthy of her love and not yet
 past middle age, insomuch that, if she saw him not in the day, she
 must needs pass an unquiet night. The gallant, meanwhile, remained
 fancy-free, for he knew nought of the lady's case; and she, being
 apprehensive of possible perils to ensue, was far too circumspect to
 make it known to him either by writing or by word of mouth of
 any of her female friends. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030008"/>Then she learned that he had much to
 do with a religious, a simple, clownish fellow, but nevertheless, as
 being a man of most holy life, reputed by almost everybody a most
 worthy friar, and decided that she could not find a better intermediary
 between herself and her lover than this same friar. So,
 having matured her plan, she hied her at a convenient time to the
 convent where the friar abode, and sent for him, saying, that, if he
 so pleased, she would be confessed by him. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030009"/>The friar, who saw at
 a glance that she was a gentlewoman, gladly heard her confession;
 which done, she said: <q>My father, I have yet a matter to confide
 to you, in which I must crave your aid and counsel. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030010"/>Who my
 kinsfolk and husband are, I wot you know, for I have myself told
 you. My husband loves me more dearly than his life, and being
 very wealthy, he can well and does forthwith afford me whatever I
 desire. Wherefore, as he loves me, even so I love him more dearly
 than myself; nor was there ever yet wicked woman that deserved
 the fire so richly as should I, were I guilty--I speak not of acts, but
 of so much as a single thought of crossing his will or tarnishing his
 honour. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030011"/>Now a man there is--his name, indeed, I know not, but
 <pb n="191"/>he seems to me to be a gentleman, and, if I mistake not, he is much
 with you--a fine man and tall, his garb dun and very decent, who,
 the bent of my mind being, belike, quite unknown to him, would
 seem to have laid siege to me, insomuch that I cannot shew
 myself at door or casement, or quit the house, but forthwith he
 presents himself before me; indeed I find it passing strange that he
 is not here now; whereat I am sorely troubled, because, when men
 so act, unmerited reproach will often thereby be cast upon honest
 women. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030012"/>At times I have been minded to inform my brothers of
 the matter; but then I have bethought me that men sometimes
 frame messages in such a way as to evoke untoward answers, whence
 follow high words; and so they proceed to rash acts: wherefore, to
 obviate trouble and scandal, I have kept silence, and by preference
 have made you my confidant, both because you are the gentleman's
 friend, and because it befits your office to censure such behaviour
 not only in friends but in strangers. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030013"/>And so I beseech you for the
 love of our only Lord God to make him sensible of his fault, and
 pray him to offend no more in such sort. Other ladies there are in
 plenty, who may, perchance, be disposed to welcome such advances,
 and be flattered to attract his fond and assiduous regard, which to
 me, who am in no wise inclined to encourage it, is but a most
 grievous molestation.</q></p><p>Having thus spoken, the lady bowed her head as if she were ready
 to weep. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030014"/>The holy friar was at no loss to apprehend who it was of
 whom she spoke; he commended her virtuous frame, firmly believing
 that what she said was true, and promised to take such action that
 she should not again suffer the like annoyance; nor, knowing that
 she was very wealthy, did he omit to extol works of charity and
 almsgiving, at the same time opening to her his own needs. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030015"/><q>I
 make my suit to you,</q> said she, <q>for the love of God; and if your
 friend should deny what I have told you, tell him roundly that 'twas

 hints which the friar had dropped touching almsgiving, she slipped
 into his hand as many coins as it would hold, praying him to say
 masses for the souls of her dead. She then rose and went home.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030017"/>Not long afterwards the gallant paid one of his wonted visits to
 the holy friar. They conversed for a while of divers topics, and
 <pb n="192"/>then the friar took him aside, and very courteously reproved him for
 so haunting and pursuing the lady with his gaze, as from what
 she had given him to understand, he supposed was his wont. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030018"/>The
 gallant, who had never regarded her with any attention, and very
 rarely passed her house, was amazed, and was about to clear himself,
 when the friar closed his mouth, saying: <q>Now away with this
 pretence of amazement, and waste not words in denial, for 'twill not
 avail thee. I have it not from the neighbours; she herself, bitterly
 complaining of thy conduct, told it me. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030019"/>I say not how ill this
 levity beseems thee; but of her I tell thee so much as this, that, if
 I ever knew woman averse to such idle philandering, she is so;
 and therefore for thy honour's sake, and that she be no more vexed,
 I pray thee refrain therefrom, and let her be in peace.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030020"/>The gallant,
 having rather more insight than the holy friar, was not slow to
 penetrate the lady's finesse; he therefore made as if he were rather
 shame-stricken, promised to go no further with the matter, and hied
 him straight from the friar to the lady's house, where she was always
 posted at a little casement to see if he were passing by. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030021"/>As she saw
 him come, she shewed him so gay and gracious a mien that he could
 no longer harbour any doubt that he had put the true construction
 upon what he had heard from the friar; and thenceforth, to his own
 satisfaction and the immense delight and solace of the lady, he
 omitted not daily to pass that way, being careful to make it appear
 as if he came upon other business. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030022"/>'Twas thus not long before the
 lady understood that she met with no less favour in his eyes than he
 in hers; and being desirous to add fuel to his flame, and to assure him
 of the love she bore him, as soon as time and occasion served, she
 returned to the holy friar, and having sat herself down at his feet in
 the church, fell a weeping. The friar asked her in a soothing tone
 what her new trouble might be. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030023"/>Whereto the lady answered:
 <q>My father, 'tis still that accursed friend of thine, of whom I made
 complaint to you some days ago, and who would now seem to have
 been born for my most grievous torment, and to cause me to do that
 by reason whereof I shall never be glad again, nor venture to place
 myself at your feet.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030024"/><q>How?</q> said the friar; <q>has he not forborne
 to annoy thee?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030025"/><q>Not he, indeed,</q> said the lady; <q>on the
 contrary, 'tis my belief that, since I complained to you of him, he
 has, as if in despite, being offended, belike, that I did so, passed my
 <pb n="193"/>house seven times for once that he did so before. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030026"/>Nay, would to
 God he were content to pass and fix me with his eyes; but he is
 waxed so bold and unabashed that only yesterday he sent a woman
 to me at home with his compliments and cajoleries, and, as if I had
 not purses and girdles enough, he sent me a purse and a girdle;
 whereat I was, as I still am, so wroth, that, had not conscience first,
 and then regard for you, weighed with me, I had flown into a frenzy
 of rage. However, I restrained myself, and resolved neither to do
 nor to say aught without first letting you know it. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030027"/>Nor only so;
 but, lest the woman who brought the purse and girdle, and to whom
 I at first returned them, shortly bidding her begone and take them
 back to the sender, should keep them and tell him that I had accepted
 them, as I believe they sometimes do, I recalled her and had them
 back, albeit 'twas in no friendly spirit that I received them from her
 hand; and I have brought them to you, that you may return them
 to him and tell him that I stand in no need of such gifts from him,
 because, thanks be to God and my husband, I have purses and girdles
 enough to smother him in. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030028"/>And if after this he leave me not alone,
 I pray you as my father to hold me excused if, come what may, I
 tell it to my husband and brothers; for much liefer had I that he
 suffer indignity, if so it must be, than that my fair fame should be
 sullied on his account: that holds good, friar.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030029"/>Weeping bitterly
 as she thus ended, she drew from under her robe a purse of very fine
 and ornate workmanship and a dainty and costly little girdle, and
 threw them into the lap of the friar, who, fully believing what she
 said, manifested the utmost indignation as he took them, and said:
 <q>Daughter, that by these advances thou shouldst be moved to anger, I
 deem neither strange nor censurable; but I am instant with thee to
 follow my advice in the matter. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030030"/>I chid him some days ago, and ill
 has he kept the promise that he made me; for which cause and this
 last feat of his I will surely make his ears so tingle that he will give
 thee no more trouble; wherefore, for God's sake, let not thyself be
 so overcome by wrath as to tell it to any of thy kinsfolk; which
 might bring upon him a retribution greater than he deserves. Nor
 fear lest thereby thy fair fame should suffer; for I shall ever be thy
 most sure witness before God and men that thou art innocent.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030031"/>The lady made a shew of being somewhat comforted: then, after a
 pause--for well she knew the greed of him and his likes--she said:
 <pb n="194"/><q>Of late, Sir, by night, the spirits of divers of my kinsfolk have
 appeared to me in my sleep, and methinks they are in most grievous
 torment; alms, alms, they crave, nought else, especially my mother,
 who seems to be in so woful and abject a plight that 'tis pitiful
 to see. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030032"/>Methinks 'tis a most grievous torment to her to see the
 tribulation which this enemy of God has brought upon me. I would
 therefore have you say for their souls the forty masses of St. Gregory
 and some of your prayers, that God may deliver them from this
 purging fire.</q> So saying she slipped a florin into the hand of the
 holy friar, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030033"/>who took it gleefully, and having with edifying words and
 many examples fortified her in her devotion, gave her his benediction,
 and suffered her to depart.</p><p>The lady gone, the friar, who had still no idea of the trick that
 had been played upon him, sent for his friend; who was no sooner
 come than he gathered from the friar's troubled air that he had news
 of the lady, and waited to hear what he would say. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030034"/>The friar
 repeated what he had said before, and then broke out into violent
 and heated objurgation on the score of the lady's latest imputation.
 The gallant, who did not as yet apprehend the friar's drift, gave but
 a very faint denial to the charge of sending the purse and girdle, in
 order that he might not discredit the lady with the friar, if, perchance,
 she had given him the purse and girdle. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030035"/>Whereupon the friar exclaimed
 with great heat: <q>How canst thou deny it, thou wicked
 man? Why, here they are; she brought them to me in tears with
 her own hand. Look at them, and say if thou knowest them not.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030036"/> The gallant now feigned to be much ashamed, and said: <q>Why,
 yes, indeed, I do know them; I confess that I did wrong; and I
 swear to you that, now I know her character, you shall never hear
 word more of this matter.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030037"/>Many words followed; and then the
 blockheadly friar gave the purse and girdle to his friend, after which
 he read him a long lecture, besought him to meddle no more with
 such matters, and on his promising obedience dismissed him.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030038"/>Elated beyond measure by the assurance which he now had of
 the lady's love, and the beautiful present, the gallant, on leaving the
 friar, hied him straight to a spot whence he stealthily gave the lady
 to see that he had both her gifts: whereat the lady was well content,
 the more so as her intrigue seemed ever to prosper more and more.
 She waited now only for her husband's departure from home to
 <pb n="195"/>crown her enterprise with success. Nor was it long before occasion
 required that her husband should go to <placeName>Genoa</placeName>. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030039"/>The very morning
 that he took horse and rode away she hied her to the holy friar, and
 after many a lamentation she said to him betwixt her sobs: <q>My
 father, now at last I tell you out and out that I can bear my suffering
 no longer. I promised you some days ago to do nought in this
 matter without first letting you know it; I am now come to crave
 release from that promise; and that you may believe that my
 lamentations and complaints are not groundless, I will tell you how
 this friend of yours, who should rather be called a devil let loose
 from hell, treated me only this very morning, a little before matins.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030040"/>As ill-luck would have it, he learned, I know not how, that yesterday
 morning my husband went to <placeName>Genoa</placeName>, and so this morning at the
 said hour he came into my garden, and got up by a tree to the
 window of my bedroom, which looks out over the garden, and had
 already opened the casement, and was about to enter the room, when
 I suddenly awoke, and got up and uttered a cry, and should have
 continued to cry out, had not he, who was still outside, implored my
 mercy for God's sake and yours, telling me who he was. So, for
 love of you I was silent, and naked as I was born, ran and shut the
 window in his face, and he--bad luck to him--made off, I suppose,
 for I saw him no more. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030041"/>Consider now if such behaviour be seemly
 and tolerable: I for my part am minded to put up with no more of
 it; indeed I have endured too much already for love of you.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030042"/>Wroth beyond measure was the friar, as he heard her thus speak,
 nor knew he what to say, except that he several times asked her if
 she were quite certain that it was no other than he. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030043"/><q>Holy name
 of God!</q> replied the lady, <q>as if I did not yet know him from
 another! He it was, I tell you; and do you give no credence to his
 denial.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030044"/><q>Daughter,</q> said then the friar, <q>there is here nought
 else to say but that this is a monstrous presumption and a most
 heinous offence; and thou didst well to send him away as thou didst.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030045"/>But seeing that God has preserved thee from shame, I would implore
 thee that, as thou hast twice followed my advice, thou do so likewise
 on this occasion, and making no complaint to any of thy kinsfolk,
 leave it to me to try if I can control this devil that has slipt his chain,
 whom I supposed to be a saint; and if I succeed in weaning him from
 this insensate folly, well and good; and if I fail, thenceforth I give
 <pb n="196"/>thee leave, with my blessing, to do whatsoever may commend itself
 to thy own judgment.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030046"/><q>Lo now,</q> answered the lady, <q>once
 again I will not vex or disobey you; but be sure that you so order
 matters that he refrain from further annoyance, as I give you my
 word that never will I have recourse to you again touching this
 matter.</q> Then, without another word, and with a troubled air, she
 took leave of him. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030047"/>Scarcely was she out of the church when the
 gallant came up. The friar called him, took him aside, and gave him
 the affront in such sort as 'twas never before given to any man,
 reviling him as a disloyal and perjured traitor. The gallant, who by
 his two previous lessons had been taught how to value the friar's
 censures, listened attentively, and sought to draw him out by ambiguous
 answers. <q>Wherefore this wrath, Sir?</q> he began. <q>Have I
 crucified Christ?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030048"/><q>Ay, mark the fellow's effrontery!</q> retorted
 the friar: <q>list to what he says! He talks, forsooth, as if 'twere
 a year or so since, and his villanies and lewdnesses were clean gone from
 his memory for lapse of time. Between matins and now hast thou
 forgotten this morning's outrage? Where wast thou this morning
 shortly before daybreak?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030049"/><q>Where was I?</q> rejoined the gallant;
 <q>that know not I. 'Tis indeed betimes that the news has reached
 you.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030050"/><q>True indeed it is,</q> said the friar, <q>that the news has
 reached
 me: I suppose that, because the husband was not there, thou never
 doubtedst that thou wouldst forthwith be received by the lady with
 open arms. Ah! the gay gallant! the honourable gentleman! he
 is now turned prowler by night, and breaks into gardens, and climbs
 trees! <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030051"/>Dost thou think by sheer importunity to vanquish the virtue
 of this lady, that thou escaladest her windows at night by the trees?
 She dislikes thee of all things in the world, and yet thou must still
 persist. Well indeed hast thou laid my admonitions to heart, to say
 nothing of the many proofs which she has given thee of her disdain!
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030052"/>But I have yet a word for thee: hitherto, not that she bears thee
 any love, but that she has yielded to my urgent prayers, she has kept
 silence as to thy misdeeds: she will do so no more: I have given her
 leave to act as she may think fit, if thou givest her any further
 annoyance. And what wilt thou do if she informs her brothers?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030053"/>The gallant, now fully apprised of what it imported him to know,
 was profuse in promises, whereby as best he might he reassured the
 friar, and so left him. The very next night, as soon as the matin
 <pb n="197"/>hour was come, he entered the garden, climbed up the tree, found the
 window open, entered the chamber, and in a trice was in the embrace
 of his fair lady. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030054"/>Anxiously had she expected him, and blithely did she
 now greet him, saying: <q>All thanks to master friar that he so well
 taught thee the way hither.</q> Then, with many a jest and laugh at
 the simplicity of the asinine friar, and many a flout at distaff-fuls and
 combs and cards, they solaced themselves with one another to their
 no small delight. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03030055"/>Nor did they omit so to arrange matters that
 they were well able to dispense with master friar, and yet pass many
 another night together with no less satisfaction: to which goal I
 pray that I, and all other Christian souls that are so minded, may be
 speedily guided of God in His holy mercy.</p></div><pb n="198"/><!--***********************************Novella 4*********************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0304"><head>Novel IV</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03040001"/><!--(i)-->Dom Felice instructs Fra Puccio how to attain blessedness

 a worthy man and wealthy, Puccio di Rinieri by name, who in later
 life, under an overpowering sense of religion, became a tertiary of
 the order of St. Francis, and was thus known as Fra Puccio. In
 which spiritual life he was the better able to persevere that his
 household consisted but of a wife and a maid, and having no need to
 occupy himself with any craft, he spent no small part of his time at
 church; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03040005"/>where, being a simple soul and slow of wit, he said his
 paternosters, heard sermons, assisted at the mass, never missed lauds
 (<!--(i)-->i. e.<!--(/i)--> when chanted by the seculars), fasted and mortified his flesh;
 nay--so
 'twas whispered--he was of the Flagellants. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03040006"/>His wife, Monna
 <persName>Isabetta</persName> by name, a woman of from twenty-eight to thirty summers,
 still young for her age, lusty, comely and plump as a casolan<note>Perhaps
 from Casoli, near <placeName>Naples</placeName>.</note> apple,
 <pb n="199"/>had not unfrequently, by reason of her husband's devoutness, if not
 also of his age, more than she cared for, of abstinence; and when she
 was sleepy, or, maybe, riggish, he would repeat to her the life of Christ,
 and the sermons of Fra Nastagio, or the lament of the Magdalen, or
 the like. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03040007"/>Now, while such was the tenor of her life, there returned
 from <placeName>Paris</placeName> a young monk, by name Dom Felice, of the convent of
 <placeName>San Pancrazio</placeName>, a well-favoured man and keen-witted, and profoundly
 learned, with whom Fra Puccio became very intimate; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03040008"/>and as there
 was no question which he could put to him but Dom Felice could
 answer it, and moreover he made great shew of holiness, for well he
 knew Fra Puccio's bent, Fra Puccio took to bringing him home and
 entertaining him at breakfast and supper, as occasion served; and for
 love of her husband the lady also grew familiar with Dom Felice,
 and was zealous to do him honour. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03040009"/>So the monk, being a constant
 visitor at Fra Puccio's house, and seeing the lady so lusty and plump,
 surmised that of which she must have most lack, and made up his
 mind to afford, if he could, at once relief to Fra Puccio and contentment
 to the lady. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03040010"/>So cautiously, now and again, he cast an admiring
 glance in her direction with such effect that he kindled in her the
 same desire with which he burned, and marking his success, took the
 first opportunity to declare his passion to her. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03040011"/>He found her fully
 disposed to gratify it; but how this might be, he was at a loss to
 discover, for she would not trust herself with him in any place whatever
 except her own house, and there it could not be, because Fra
 Puccio never travelled; whereby the monk was greatly dejected.
 Long he pondered the matter, and at length thought of an expedient,
 whereby he might be with the lady in her own house without
 incurring suspicion, notwithstanding that Fra Puccio was there.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03040012"/>So, being with Fra Puccio one day, he said to him: <q>Reasons
 many have I to know, Fra Puccio, that all thy desire is to become a
 saint; but it seems to me that thou farest by a circuitous route,
 whereas there is one very direct, which the Pope and the greater
 prelates that are about him know and use, but will have it remain a
 secret, because otherwise the clergy, who for the most part live by
 alms, and could not then expect alms or aught else from the laity,
 would be speedily ruined. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03040013"/>However, as thou art my friend, and hast
 shewn me much honour, I would teach thee that way, if I were assured
 that thou wouldst follow it without letting another soul in the world
 <pb n="200"/>hear of it.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03040014"/>Fra Puccio was now all agog to hear more of the matter,
 and began most earnestly entreating Dom Felice to teach him the
 way, swearing that without Dom Felice's leave none should ever
 hear of it from him, and averring that, if he found it practicable, he
 would certainly follow it. <q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03040015"/>I am satisfied with thy promises,</q> said
 the monk, <q>and I will shew thee the way. Know then that the
 holy doctors hold that whoso would achieve blessedness must do the
 penance of which I shall tell thee; but see thou take me judiciously.
 I do not say that after the penance thou wilt not be a sinner, as thou
 art; but the effect will be that the sins which thou hast committed
 up to the very hour of the penance will all be purged away and
 thereby remitted to thee, and the sins which thou shalt commit
 thereafter will not be written against thee to thy damnation, but will
 be quit by holy water, like venial sins. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03040016"/>First of all then the penitent
 must with great exactitude confess his sins when he comes to begin
 the penance. Then follows a period of fasting and very strict
 abstinence which must last for forty days, during which time he is to
 touch no woman whomsoever, not even his wife. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03040017"/>Moreover, thou
 must have in thy house some place whence thou mayst see the sky
 by night, whither thou must resort at compline; and there thou must
 have a beam, very broad, and placed in such a way, that, standing,
 thou canst rest thy nether part upon it, and so, not raising thy feet
 from the ground, thou must extend thy arms, so as to make a sort of
 crucifix, and if thou wouldst have pegs to rest them on thou mayst;
 and on this manner, thy gaze fixed on the sky, and never moving a
 jot, thou must stand until matins. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03040018"/>And wert thou lettered, it were
 proper for thee to say meanwhile certain prayers that I would give
 thee; but as thou art not so, thou must say three hundred paternosters
 and as many avemarias in honour of the Trinity; and thus
 contemplating the sky, be ever mindful that God was the creator of
 the heaven and the earth, and being set even as Christ was upon the
 cross, meditate on His passion. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03040019"/>Then, when the matin-bell sounds,
 thou mayst, if thou please, go to bed--but see that thou undress not--and
 sleep; but in the morning thou must go to church, and hear
 at least three masses, and say fifty paternosters and as many avemarias;
 after which thou mayst with a pure heart do aught that thou hast
 to do, and breakfast; but at vespers thou must be again at church,
 and say there certain prayers, which I shall give thee in writing and
 <pb n="201"/>which are indispensable, and after compline thou must repeat thy
 former exercise. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03040020"/>Do this, and I, who have done it before thee, have
 good hope that even before thou shalt have reached the end of the
 penance, thou wilt, if thou shalt do it in a devout spirit, have already
 a marvellous foretaste of the eternal blessedness.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03040021"/><q>This,</q> said Fra
 Puccio, <q>is neither a very severe nor a very long penance, and can
 be very easily managed: wherefore in God's name I will begin on
 Sunday.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03040022"/>And so he took his leave of Dom Felice, and went home,
 and, by Dom Felice's permission, informed his wife of every particular
 of his intended penance.</p><p>The lady understood very well what the monk meant by enjoining
 him not to stir from his post until matins; and deeming it an
 excellent device, she said that she was well content that he should do
 this or aught else that he thought good for his soul; and to the end
 that his penance might be blest of God, she would herself fast with
 him, though she would go no further. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03040023"/>So they did as they had
 agreed: when Sunday came Fra Puccio began his penance, and master
 monk, by understanding with the lady, came most evenings, at the
 hour when he was secure from discovery, to sup with her, always
 bringing
 with him abundance both of meat and of drink, and after slept
 with her till the matin hour, when he got up and left her, and Fra
 Puccio went to bed. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03040024"/>The place which Fra Puccio had chosen for
 his penance was close to the room in which the lady slept, and only
 separated from it by the thinnest of partitions; so that, the monk and
 the lady disporting themselves with one another without stint or
 restraint, Fra Puccio thought he felt the floor of the house shake a
 little, and pausing at his hundredth paternoster, but without leaving
 his post, called out to the lady to know what she was about. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03040025"/>The
 lady, who dearly loved a jest, and was just then riding the horse of
 St. Benedict or St. John Gualbert, answered: <q>I'faith, husband, I am
 as restless as may be.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03040026"/><q>Restless,</q> said Fra Puccio, <q>how so? What
 means this restlessness?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03040027"/>Whereto with a hearty laugh, for which
 she doubtless had good occasion, the bonny lady replied: <q>What
 means it? How should you ask such a question? Why, I have
 heard you say a thousand times: 'Who fasting goes to bed, uneasy
 lies his head.'</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03040028"/>Fra Puccio, supposing that her wakefulness and
 restlessness abed was due to want of food, said in good faith: <q>Wife,
 I told thee I would have thee not fast; but as thou hast chosen to
 <pb n="202"/>fast, think not of it, but think how thou mayst compose thyself to
 sleep; thou tossest about the bed in such sort that the shaking is felt
 here.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03040029"/><q>That need cause thee no alarm,</q> rejoined the lady. <q>I
 know what I am about; I will manage as well as I can, and do thou
 likewise.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03040030"/>So Fra Puccio said no more to her, but resumed his
 paternosters; and thenceforth every night, while Fra Puccio's penance
 lasted, the lady and master monk, having had a bed made up for them
 in another part of the house, did there wanton it most gamesomely,
 the monk departing and the lady going back to her bed at one and
 the same time, being shortly before Fra Puccio's return from his
 nightly vigil. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03040031"/>The friar thus persisting in his penance while the lady
 took her fill of pleasure with the monk, she would from time to time
 say jestingly to him: <q>Thou layest a penance upon Fra Puccio
 whereby we are rewarded with Paradise.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03040032"/>So well indeed did she
 relish the dainties with which the monk regaled her, the more so by
 contrast with the abstemious life to which her husband had long
 accustomed her, that, when Fra Puccio's penance was done, she found
 means to enjoy them elsewhere, and ordered her indulgence with
 such discretion as to ensure its long continuance. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03040033"/>Whereby (that my
 story may end as it began) it came to pass that Fra Puccio, hoping by
 his penance to win a place for himself in Paradise, did in fact translate
 thither the monk who had shewn him the way, and the wife who
 lived with him in great dearth of that of which the monk in his
 charity gave her superabundant largess.</p></div><pb n="203"/><!--***********************************Novella 5*********************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0305"><head>Novel V</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03050001"/><!--(i)-->Zima gives a palfrey to Messer <placeName>France</placeName>sco Vergellesi,

	am minded, without deviating from the prescribed order, to acquaint
	you with that which thereby befell a certain knight of <placeName>Pistoia</placeName>.</p></body></floatingText><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03050004"/>Know then that at <placeName>Pistoia</placeName> there lived a knight, Messer <placeName>France</placeName>sco,
 by name, of the Vergellesi family, a man of much wealth and good
 parts, being both wise and clever, but withal niggardly beyond
 measure. Which Messer <placeName>France</placeName>sco, having to go to <placeName>Milan</placeName> in the
 capacity of podestà, had provided himself with all that was meet
 for the honourable support of such a dignity, save only a palfrey
 handsome enough for him; and not being able to come by any
 such, he felt himself at a loss. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03050005"/>Now there was then in <placeName>Pistoia</placeName>
 a young man, Ricciardo by name, of low origin but great wealth,
 who went always so trim and fine and foppish of person, that folk
 <pb n="204"/>had bestowed upon him the name of Zima,<note>From the Low Latin
 aczima, explained by Du Cange as <q>tonture de
 draps,</q> the process of dressing cloth so as to give it an even nap. Zima
 is thus equivalent to <q>nitidus.</q> Cf. Vocab. degli Accademici della
 Crusca,
 <q>Azzimare.</q></note> by which he was
 generally known. Zima had long and to no purpose burned and
 yearned for love of Messer <placeName>France</placeName>sco's very fair and no less virtuous
 wife. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03050006"/>His passion was matter of common notoriety; and so it befell
 that some one told Messer <placeName>France</placeName>sco that he had but to ask Zima,
 who was the possessor of one of the handsomest palfreys in <placeName>Tuscany</placeName>,
 which on that account he greatly prized, and he would not hesitate
 to give him the horse for the love which he bore his wife. So our
 niggardly knight sent for Zima, and offered to buy the horse of
 him, hoping thereby to get him from Zima as a gift. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03050007"/>Zima
 heard the knight gladly, and thus made answer: <q>Sell you my
 horse, Sir, I would not, though you gave me all that you have in
 the world; but I shall be happy to give him to you, when you will,
 on this condition, that, before he pass into your hands, I may by your
 leave and in your presence say a few words to your wife so privately
 that I may be heard by her alone.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03050008"/>Thinking at once to gratify
 his cupidity and to outwit Zima, the knight answered that he was
 content that it should be even as Zima wished. Then, leaving him
 in the hall of the palace, he went to his lady's chamber, and told her
 the easy terms on which he might acquire the palfrey, bidding her
 give Zima his audience, but on no account to vouchsafe him a word
 of reply. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03050009"/>This the lady found by no means to her mind, but, as
 she must needs obey her husband's commands, she promised compliance,
 and followed him into the hall to hear what Zima might
 have to say. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03050010"/>Zima then renewed his contract with the knight in due
 form; whereupon, the lady being seated in a part of the hall where
 she was quite by herself, he sate down by her side, and thus began:
 <q>Noble lady, I have too much respect for your understanding
 to doubt that you have long been well aware of the extremity of
 passion whereto I have been brought by your beauty, which certainly
 exceeds that of any other lady that I have ever seen, to say nothing
 of your exquisite manners and incomparable virtues, which might
 well serve to captivate every soaring spirit that is in the world;
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03050011"/>wherefore there need no words of mine to assure you that I love
 <pb n="205"/>you with a love greater and more ardent than any that man yet
 bore to woman, and so without doubt I shall do, as long as my
 woful life shall hold this frame together; nay, longer yet, for, if
 love there be in the next world as in this, I shall love you evermore.
 And so you may make your mind secure that there is nothing that
 is yours, be it precious or be it common, which you may count as
 in such and so sure a sort your own as me, for all that I am and have.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03050012"/>And that thereof you may not lack evidence of infallible cogency,
 I tell you, that I should deem myself more highly favoured, if I
 might at your command do somewhat to pleasure you, than if at
 my command the whole world were forthwith to yield me obedience.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03050013"/>And as 'tis even in such sort that I am yours, 'tis not unworthily
 that I make bold to offer my petitions to Your Highness, as being
 to me the sole, exclusive source of all peace, of all bliss, of all health.
 Wherefore, as your most lowly vassal, I pray you, dear my bliss,
 my soul's one hope, wherein she nourishes herself in love's devouring
 flame, that in your great benignity you deign so far to mitigate the
 harshness which in the past you have shewn towards me, yours though
 I am, that, consoled by your compassion, I may say, that, as 'twas
 by your beauty that I was smitten with love, so 'tis to your pity
 that I owe my life, which, if in your haughtiness you lend not ear
 unto my prayers, will assuredly fail, so that I shall die, and, it may
 be, 'twill be said that you slew me. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03050014"/>'Twould not redound to your
 honour that I died for love of you; but let that pass; I cannot but
 think, however, that you would sometimes feel a touch of remorse,
 and would grieve that 'twas your doing, and that now and again,
 relenting, you would say to yourself: 'Ah! how wrong it was of
 me that I had not pity on my Zima;' by which too late repentance
 you would but enhance your grief. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03050015"/>Wherefore, that this come not
 to pass, repent you while it is in your power to give me ease, and
 shew pity on me before I die, seeing that with you it rests to make
 me either the gladdest or the saddest man that lives. My trust is
 in your generosity, that 'twill not brook that a love so great and
 of such a sort as mine should receive death for guerdon, and that
 by a gladsome and gracious answer you will repair my shattered
 spirits, which are all a-tremble in your presence for very fear.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03050016"/>When he had done, he heaved several very deep sighs, and a few
 tears started from his eyes, while he awaited the lady's answer.</p><pb n="206"/><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03050017"/>Long time he had wooed her with his eyes, had tilted in her
 honour, had greeted her rising with music; and against these and
 all like modes of attack she had been proof; but the heartfelt words
 of her most ardent lover were not without their effect, and she now
 began to understand what she had never till then understood, to wit,
 what love really means. So, albeit she obeyed her lord's behest, and
 kept silence, yet she could not but betray by a slight sigh that which,
 if she might have given Zima his answer, she would readily have
 avowed. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03050018"/>After waiting a while, Zima found it strange that no
 answer was forthcoming; and he then began to perceive the trick
 which the knight had played him. However, he kept his eyes fixed
 on the lady, and observing that her eyes glowed now and again, as
 they met his, and noting the partially suppressed sighs which escaped
 her, he gathered a little hope, which gave him courage to try a novel
 plan of attack. So, while the lady listened, he began to make answer
 for her to himself on this wise: 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03050019"/><q>Zima mine, true indeed it is that
 long since I discerned that thou didst love me with a love exceeding
 great and whole-hearted, whereof I have now yet ampler assurance
 by thine own words, and well content I am therewith, as indeed
 I ought to be. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03050020"/>And however harsh and cruel I may have seemed
 to thee, I would by no means have thee believe, that I have been such
 at heart as I have seemed in aspect; rather, be assured that I have
 ever loved thee and held thee dear above all other men; the mien
 which I have worn was but prescribed by fear of another and
 solicitude for my fair fame. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03050021"/>But a time will soon come when I
 shall be able to give thee plain proof of my love, and to accord
 the love which thou hast borne and dost bear me its due guerdon.
 Wherefore be comforted and of good hope; for, Messer <placeName>France</placeName>sco
 is to go in a few days' time to <placeName>Milan</placeName> as podestà, as thou well
 knowest, seeing that for love of me thou hast given him thy fine
 palfrey; and I vow to thee upon my faith, upon the true love
 which I bear thee, that without fail, within a few days thereafter
 thou shalt be with me, and we will give our love complete and
 gladsome consummation. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03050022"/>And that I may have no more occasion
 to speak to thee of this matter, be it understood between us that
 henceforth when thou shalt observe two towels disposed at the
 window of my room which overlooks the garden, thou shalt come
 to me after nightfall of that same day by the garden door (and look
 <pb n="207"/>well to it that thou be not seen), and thou shalt find me waiting
 for thee, and we will have our fill of mutual cheer and solace all
 night long.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03050023"/>Having thus answered for the lady, Zima resumed his own
 person and thus replied to the lady: <q>Dearest madam, your boon
 response so overpowers my every faculty that scarce can I frame
 words to render you due thanks; and, were I able to utter all I feel,
 time, however long, would fail me fully to thank you as I would
 fain and as I ought: wherefore I must even leave it to your sage
 judgment to divine that which I yearn in vain to put in words.
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03050024"/>Let this one word suffice, that as you bid me, so I shall not fail
 to do; and then, having, perchance, firmer assurance of the great
 boon which you have granted me, I will do my best endeavour to
 thank you in terms the amplest that I may command. For the
 present there is no more to say; and so, dearest my lady, I commend
 you to God; and may He grant you your heart's content of
 joy and bliss.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03050025"/>To all which the lady returned never a word:
 wherefore Zima rose and turned to rejoin the knight, who, seeing
 him on his feet, came towards him, and said with a laugh: <q>How
 sayst thou? Have I faithfully kept my promise to thee?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03050026"/><q>Not so,
 Sir,</q> replied Zima; <q>for by thy word I was to have spoken with thy
 wife, and by thy deed I have spoken to a statue of marble.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03050027"/>Which
 remark was much relished by the knight, who, well as he had thought
 of his wife, thought now even better of her, and said: <q>So thy
 palfrey, that was, is now mine out and out.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03050028"/><q>'Tis even so, Sir,</q>
 replied Zima; <q>but had I thought to have gotten such fruit as I
 have from this favour of yours, I would not have craved it, but
 would have let you have the palfrey as a free gift: and would to
 God I had done so, for, as it is, you have bought the palfrey and
 I have not sold him.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03050029"/>This drew a laugh from the knight, who
 within a few days thereafter mounted the palfrey which he had
 gotten, and took the road for <placeName>Milan</placeName>, there to enter on his podestate.
 The lady, now mistress of herself, bethought her of Zima's words,
 and the love which he bore her, and for which he had parted with
 his palfrey; and observing that he frequently passed her house, said
 to herself: 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03050030"/><q>What am I about? Why throw I my youth away?
 My husband is gone to <placeName>Milan</placeName>, and will not return for six months,
 and when can he ever restore them to me? When I am old!
 <pb n="208"/>And besides, shall I ever find another such lover as Zima? I am
 quite by myself. There is none to fear. I know not why I take
 not my good time while I may: I shall not always have the like
 opportunity as at present: no one will ever know; and if it should
 get known, 'tis better to do and repent than to forbear and repent.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03050031"/>Of which meditations the issue was that one day she set two towels
 in the window overlooking the garden, according to Zima's word;
 and Zima having marked them with much exultation, stole at
 nightfall alone to the door of the lady's garden, and finding it open,
 crossed to another door that led into the house, where he found the
 lady awaiting him. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03050032"/>On sight of him she rose to meet him, and
 gave him the heartiest of welcomes. A hundred thousand times
 he embraced and kissed her, as he followed her upstairs: then
 without delay they hied them to bed, and knew love's furthest
 bourne. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03050033"/>And so far was the first time from being in this case the
 last, that, while the knight was at <placeName>Milan</placeName>, and indeed after his return,
 there were seasons not a few at which Zima resorted thither to the
 immense delight of both parties.</p></div><pb n="209"/><!--***********************************Novella 6*********************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0306"><head>Novel VI</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060001"/><!--(i)-->Ricciardo Minutolo loves the wife of Filippello Fighinolfi,

 its superior or perhaps its equal in <placeName>Italy</placeName>, there once lived a young
 man, renowned alike for noble blood and the splendour of his vast
 wealth, his name Ricciardo Minutolo. He was mated with a very
 fair and loving wife; but nevertheless he became enamoured of a
 lady who in the general opinion vastly surpassed in beauty every other
 lady in <placeName>Naples</placeName>. Catella--such was the lady's name--was married to
 <pb n="210"/>a young man, likewise of gentle blood, Filippello Fighinolfi by name,
 whom she, most virtuous of ladies, loved and held dear above all else
 in the world. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060005"/>Being thus enamoured of Catella, Ricciardo Minutolo
 left none of those means untried whereby a lady's favour and love
 are wont to be gained, but for all that he made no way towards the
 attainment of his heart's desire: whereby he fell into a sort of despair,
 and witless and powerless to loose himself from his love, found life
 scarce tolerable, and yet knew not how to die. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060006"/>While in this frame
 he languished, it befell one day that some ladies that were of kin to
 him counselled him earnestly to be quit of such a love, whereby he
 could but fret himself to no purpose, seeing that Catella cared for
 nought in the world save Filippello, and lived in such a state of
 jealousy on his account that never a bird flew but she feared lest it
 should snatch him from her. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060007"/>So soon as Ricciardo heard of Catella's
 jealousy, he forthwith began to ponder how he might make it
 subserve his end. He feigned to have given up his love for Catella
 as hopeless, and to have transferred it to another lady, in whose
 honour he accordingly began to tilt and joust and do all that he
 had been wont to do in honour of Catella. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060008"/>Nor was it long before
 well-nigh all the Neapolitans, including Catella herself, began to
 think that he had forgotten Catella, and was to the last degree
 enamoured of the other lady. In this course he persisted, until the
 opinion was so firmly rooted in the minds of all that even Catella
 laid aside a certain reserve which she had used towards him while
 she deemed him her lover, and, coming and going, greeted him in
 friendly, neighbourly fashion, like the rest. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060009"/>Now it so befell that
 during the hot season, when, according to the custom of the
 Neapolitans, many companies of ladies and gentlemen went down to
 the sea-coast to recreate themselves and breakfast and sup, Ricciardo,
 knowing that Catella was gone thither with her company, went
 likewise with his, but, making as if he were not minded to stay
 there, he received several invitations from the ladies of Catella's
 company before he accepted any. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060010"/>When the ladies received him,
 they all with one accord, including Catella, began to rally him on
 his new love, and he furnished them with more matter for talk
 by feigning a most ardent passion. At length most of the ladies
 being gone off, one hither, another thither, as they do in such places,
 leaving Catella and a few others with Ricciardo, he tossed at Catella
 <pb n="211"/>a light allusion to a certain love of her husband Filippello, which
 threw her at once into such a fit of jealousy, that she inly burned
 with a vehement desire to know what Ricciardo meant. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060011"/>For a
 while she kept her own counsel; then, brooking no more suspense,
 she adjured Ricciardo, by the love he bore the lady whom most he
 loved, to expound to her what he had said touching Filippello. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060012"/>He
 answered thus: <q>You have adjured me by her to whom I dare
 not deny aught that you may ask of me; my riddle therefore I will
 presently read you, provided you promise me that neither to him nor
 to any one else will you impart aught of what I shall relate to you,
 until you shall have ocular evidence of its truth; which, so you desire
 it, I will teach you how you may obtain.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060013"/>The lady accepted his
 terms, which rather confirmed her belief in his veracity, and swore
 that she would not tell a soul. They then drew a little apart, that
 they might not be overheard by the rest, and Ricciardo thus began:
 <q>Madam, did I love you, as I once did, I should not dare to tell
 you aught that I thought might cause you pain; but, now that that
 love is past, I shall have the less hesitation in telling you the truth.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060014"/>Whether Filippello ever resented the love which I bore you, or
 deemed that it was returned by you, I know not: whether it were
 so or no, he certainly never shewed any such feeling to me; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060015"/>but
 so it is that now, having waited, perhaps, until, as he supposes, I am
 less likely to be on my guard, he shews a disposition to serve me
 as I doubt he suspects that I served him; that is to say, he would
 fain have his pleasure of my wife, whom for some time past he has,
 as I discover, plied with messages through most secret channels. She
 has told me all, and has answered him according to my instructions:
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060016"/>but only this morning, just before I came hither, I found a woman
 in close parley with her in the house, whose true character and
 purpose I forthwith divined; so I called my wife, and asked what the
 woman wanted. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060017"/>Whereto she answered: ''Tis this persecution
 by Filippello which thou hast brought upon me by the encouraging
 answers that thou wouldst have me give him: he now tells me that
 he is most earnestly desirous to know my intentions, and that, should
 I be so minded, he would contrive that I should have secret access
 to a bagnio in this city, and he is most urgent and instant that I
 should consent. And hadst thou not, wherefore I know not, bidden
 me keep the affair afoot, I would have dismissed him in such a
 <pb n="212"/>sort that my movements would have been exempt from his prying
 observation for ever. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060018"/>Upon this I saw that the affair was going
 too far; I determined to have no more of it, and to let you know
 it, that you may understand how he requites your whole-hearted
 faith, which brought me of late to the verge of death. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060019"/>And that
 you may not suppose that these are but empty words and idle tales,
 but may be able, should you so desire, to verify them by sight and
 touch, I caused my wife to tell the woman who still waited her
 answer, that she would be at the bagnio to-morrow about none,
 during the siesta: with which answer the woman went away well
 content. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060020"/>Now you do not, I suppose, imagine that I would send
 her thither; but if I were in your place, he should find me there
 instead of her whom he thinks to find there; and when I had been
 some little time with him, I would give him to understand with
 whom he had been, and he should have of me such honour as he
 deserved. Whereby, I doubt not, he would be put to such shame
 as would at one and the same time avenge both the wrong which
 he has done to you and that which he plots against me.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060021"/>Catella, as is the wont of the jealous, hearkened to Ricciardo's words
 without so much as giving a thought to the speaker or his wiles,
 inclined at once to credit his story, and began to twist certain antecedent
 matters into accord with it; then, suddenly kindling with
 wrath, she answered, that to the bagnio she would certainly go;
 'twould cause her no great inconvenience, and if he should come, she
 would so shame him that he should never again set eyes on woman
 but his ears would tingle. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060022"/>Satisfied by what he heard, that his
 stratagem was well conceived, and success sure, Ricciardo added much
 in corroboration of his story, and having thus confirmed her belief
 in it, besought her to keep it always close, whereto she pledged
 her faith.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060023"/>Next morning Ricciardo hied him to the good woman that kept
 the bagnio to which he had directed Catella, told her the enterprise
 which he had in hand, and prayed her to aid him therein so far as
 she might be able. The good woman, who was much beholden to
 him, assured him that she would gladly do so, and concerted with
 him all that was to be said and done. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060024"/>She had in the bagnio a room
 which was very dark, being without any window to admit the light.
 This room, by Ricciardo's direction, she set in order, and made up a
 <pb n="213"/>bed there as well as she could, into which bed Ricciardo got, as soon
 as he had breakfasted, and there awaited Catella's coming.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060025"/>Now Catella, still giving more credence to Ricciardo's story than
 it merited, had gone home in the evening in a most resentful mood,
 and Filippello, returning home the same evening with a mind greatly
 preoccupied, was scarce as familiar with her as he was wont to be.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060026"/>Which she marking, grew yet more suspicious than before, and said
 to herself: <q>Doubtless he is thinking of the lady of whom he expects
 to take his pleasure to-morrow, as most assuredly he shall not;</q> and
 so, musing and meditating what she should say to him after their
 rencounter at the bagnio, she spent the best part of the night. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060027"/>But--to
 shorten my story--upon the stroke of none Catella, taking with
 her a single attendant, but otherwise adhering to her original intention,
 hied her to the bagnio which Ricciardo had indicated; and finding
 the good woman there, asked her whether Filippello had been there
 that day. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060028"/>Primed by Ricciardo, the good woman asked her, whether
 she were the lady that was to come to speak with him; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060029"/>to which she
 answered in the affirmative. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060030"/><q>Go to him, then,</q> said the good
 woman. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060031"/>And so Catella, in quest of that which she would gladly
 not have found, was shewn to the chamber where Ricciardo was,
 and having entered without uncovering her head, closed the door
 behind her. Overjoyed to see her, Ricciardo sprang out of bed, took
 her in his arms, and said caressingly: <q>Welcome, my soul.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060032"/>Catella, dissembling, for she was minded at first to counterfeit another
 woman, returned his embrace, kissed him, and lavished endearments
 upon him; saying, the while, not a word, lest her speech should
 betray her. The darkness of the room, which was profound, was
 equally welcome to both; nor were they there long enough for their
 eyes to recover power. Ricciardo helped Catella on to the bed,
 where, with no word said on either side in a voice that might be
 recognized, they lay a long while, much more to the solace and
 satisfaction of the one than of the other party. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060033"/>Then, Catella,
 deeming it high time to vent her harboured resentment, burst forth
 in a blaze of wrath on this wise: <q>Alas! how wretched is the lot
 of women, how misplaced of not a few the love they bear their
 husbands! Ah, woe is me! for eight years have I loved thee more
 dearly than my life; and now I find that thou, base miscreant that
 thou art, dost nought but burn and languish for love of another
 <pb n="214"/>woman! <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060034"/>Here thou hast been--with whom, thinkest thou? Even
 with her whom thou hast too long deluded with thy false blandishments,
 making pretence to love her while thou art enamoured of
 another. 'Tis I, Catella, not the wife of Ricciardo, false traitor
 that thou art; list if thou knowest my voice; 'tis I indeed! Ah!
 would we were but in the light!--it seems to me a thousand years
 till then--that I might shame thee as thou deservest, vile, pestilent
 dog that thou art! <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060035"/>Alas! woe is me! such love as I have borne so
 many years--to whom? To this faithless dog, that, thinking to have a
 strange woman in his embrace, has in the brief while that I have
 been with him here lavished upon me more caresses and endearments
 than during all the forepast time that I have been his! <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060036"/>A lively
 spark indeed art thou to-day, renegade dog, that shewest thyself
 so limp and enervate and impotent at home! But, God be praised,
 thou hast tilled thine own plot, and not another's, as thou didst believe.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060037"/>No wonder that last night thou heldest aloof from me; thou wast
 thinking of scattering thy seed elsewhere, and wast minded to shew
 thyself a lusty knight when thou shouldst join battle. But praise be
 to God and my sagacity, the water has nevertheless taken its proper
 course. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060038"/>Where is thy answer, culprit? Hast thou nought to say?
 Have my words struck thee dumb? God's faith! I know not why I
 forbear to pluck thine eyes out with my fingers! Thou thoughtest
 to perpetrate this treason with no small secrecy; but, by God, one is
 as knowing as another; thy plot has failed; I had better hounds on
 thy trail than thou didst think for.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060039"/>Ricciardo, inly delighted by her
 words, made no answer, but embraced and kissed her more than
 ever, and overwhelmed her with his endearments. So she continued
 her reproaches, saying: <q>Ay, thou thinkest to cajole me with thy
 feigned caresses, wearisome dog that thou art, and so to pacify and
 mollify me; but thou art mistaken. I shall never be mollified, until
 I have covered thee with infamy in the presence of all our kinsfolk
 and friends and neighbours. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060040"/>Am I not, miscreant, as fair as the wife
 of Ricciardo Minutolo? Am I not as good a lady as she? Why
 dost not answer, vile dog? Wherein has she the advantage of me?
 Away with thee! touch me not; thou hast done feats of arms more
 than enough for to-day. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060041"/>Well I know that, now that thou knowest
 who I am, thou wilt wreak thy will on me by force: but by God's
 grace I will yet disappoint thee. I know not why I forbear to send
 <pb n="215"/>for Ricciardo, who loved me more than himself and yet was never
 able to boast that he had a single glance from me; nor know I why
 'twere wrong to do so. Thou thoughtest to have his wife here, and
 'tis no fault of thine that thou hadst her not: so, if I had him, thou
 couldst not justly blame me.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060042"/>Enough had now been said: the lady's mortification was extreme;
 and, as she ended, Ricciardo bethought him that, if he suffered her,
 thus deluded, to depart, much evil might ensue. He therefore
 resolved to make himself known, and disabuse her of her error. So,
 taking her in his arms, and clipping her so close that she could not
 get loose, he said: <q>Sweet my soul, be not wroth: that which,
 while artlessly I loved, I might not have, Love has taught me to
 compass by guile: know that I am thy Ricciardo.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060043"/>At these words and the voice, which she recognized, Catella
 started, and would have sprung out of the bed; which being
 impossible, she essayed a cry; but Ricciardo laid a hand upon her
 mouth, and closed it, saying: <q>Madam, that which is done can
 never be undone, though you should cry out for the rest of your
 days, and should you in such or any other wise publish this matter to
 any, two consequences will ensue. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060044"/>In the first place (and this is a
 point which touches you very nearly) your honour and fair fame will
 be blasted; for, however you may say that I lured you hither by
 guile, I shall deny it, and affirm, on the contrary, that I induced you
 to come hither by promises of money and gifts, and that 'tis but
 because you are vexed that what I gave you did not altogether come
 up to your expectations, that you make such a cry and clamour; and
 you know that folk are more prone to believe evil than good, and
 therefore I am no less likely to be believed than you. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060045"/>The further
 consequence will be mortal enmity between your husband and me, and
 the event were as like to be that I killed him as that he killed me:
 which if I did, you would never more know joy or peace. Wherefore,
 heart of my body, do not at one and the same time bring dishonour
 upon yourself and set your husband and me at strife and in jeopardy
 of our lives. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060046"/>You are not the first, nor will you be the last to be
 beguiled; nor have I beguiled you to rob you of aught, but for excess
 of love that I bear, and shall ever bear, you, being your most lowly
 vassal. And though it is now a great while that I, and what I have
 and can and am worth, are yours, yet I am minded that so it shall be
 <pb n="216"/>henceforth more than ever before. Your discretion in other matters
 is not unknown to me, and I doubt not 'twill be equally manifest
 in this.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060047"/>Ricciardo's admonitions were received by Catella with many a
 bitter tear; but though she was very wroth and very sad at heart,
 yet Ricciardo's true words so far commanded the assent of her
 reason, that she acknowledged that 'twas possible they might be
 verified by the event. Wherefore she made answer: 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060048"/><q>Ricciardo,
 I know not how God will grant me patience to bear the villainy and
 knavery which thou hast practised upon me; and though in this
 place, to which simplicity and excess of jealousy guided my steps, I
 raise no cry, rest assured that I shall never be happy, until in one way
 or another I know myself avenged of that which thou hast done to
 me. Wherefore unhand me, let me go: thou hast had thy desire of
 me, and hast tormented me to thy heart's content: 'tis time to release
 me; let me go, I pray thee.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060049"/>But Ricciardo, seeing that she was
 still much ruffled in spirit, was resolved not to let her go, until he
 had made his peace with her. So he addressed himself to soothe
 her; and by dint of most dulcet phrases and entreaties and adjurations
 he did at last prevail with her to give him her pardon; nay, by
 joint consent, they tarried there a great while to the exceeding great
 delight of both. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03060050"/>Indeed the lady, finding her lover's kisses smack
 much better than those of her husband, converted her asperity into
 sweetness, and from that day forth cherished a most tender love for
 Ricciardo; whereof, using all circumspection, they many a time had
 solace. God grant us solace of ours.</p></div><pb n="217"/><!--***********************************Novella 7*********************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0307"><head>Novel VII</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070001"/><!--(i)-->Tedaldo, being in disfavour with his lady, departs from

      <placeName>Florence</placeName> a young noble, his name Tedaldo Elisei, who being beyond
      measure enamoured of a lady hight Monna Ermellina, wife of one
      Aldobrandino Palermini, and by reason of his admirable qualities
      richly deserving to have his desire, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070005"/>found Fortune nevertheless adverse,
      as she is wont to be to the prosperous. Inasmuch as, for some reason
      or another, the lady, having shewn herself gracious towards Tedaldo
      for a while, completely altered her mien, and not only shewed him no
      further favour, but would not so much as receive a message from him
      or suffer him to see her face; whereby he fell a prey to a grievous
      and distressful melancholy; but so well had he concealed his love
      that the cause of his melancholy was surmised by none. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070006"/>He tried
      hard in divers ways to recover the love which he deemed himself to
      have lost for no fault of his, and finding all his efforts unavailing, he
      <pb n="218"/>resolved to bid the world adieu, that he might not afford her
      who was the cause of his distress the satisfaction of seeing him
      languish. So he got together as much money as he might, and
      secretly, no word said to friend or kinsman except only a familiar
      gossip, who knew all, he took his departure for <placeName>Ancona</placeName>. Arrived
      there, he assumed the name of <persName>Filippo</persName> Santodeccio, and having
      forgathered with a rich merchant, entered his service. The merchant
      took him with him to <placeName>Cyprus</placeName> aboard one of his ships, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070007"/>and was so well
      pleased with his bearing and behaviour that he not only gave him a
      handsome salary but made him in a sort his companion, and entrusted
      him with the management of no small part of his affairs: wherein he
      proved himself so apt and assiduous, that in the course of a few years
      he was himself established in credit and wealth and great repute as a
      merchant. Seven years thus passed, during which, albeit his thoughts
      frequently reverted to his cruel mistress, and sorely love smote him,
      and much he yearned to see her again, yet such was his firmness that
      he came off conqueror, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070008"/>until one day in <placeName>Cyprus</placeName> it so befell that
      there was sung in his hearing a song that he had himself composed,
      and of which the theme was the mutual love that was between his
      lady and him, and the delight that he had of her; which as he heard,
      he found it incredible that she should have forgotten him, and burned
      with such a desire to see her once more, that, being able to hold out
      no longer, he made up his mind to return to <placeName>Florence</placeName>. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070009"/>So, having
      set all his affairs in order, he betook him, attended only by a single
      servant, to <placeName>Ancona</placeName>; whence he sent all his effects, as they arrived,
      forward to <placeName>Florence</placeName>, consigning them to a friend of his Ancontan
      partner, and followed with his servant in the disguise of a pilgrim
      returned from the <placeName>Holy Sepulchre</placeName>. Arrived at <placeName>Florence</placeName>, he put
      up at a little hostelry kept by two brothers hard by his lady's house,
      <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070010"/>whither he forthwith hied him, hoping that, perchance, he might
      have sight of her from the street; but, finding all barred and
      bolted, doors, windows and all else, he doubted much, she must be
      dead, or have removed thence. So, with a very heavy heart, he
 returned to the house of the two brothers, and to his great surprise
      found his own four brothers standing in front of it, all in black. He
      knew that he was so changed from his former semblance, both in dress
      and in person, that he might not readily be recognized, and he had
      therefore no hesitation in going up to a shoemaker and asking him
      <pb n="219"/>why these men were all dressed in black. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070011"/>The shoemaker answered:
      <q>'Tis because 'tis not fifteen days since a brother of theirs, Tedaldo
	by name, that had been long abroad, was slain; and I understand
	that they have proved in court that one Aldobrandino Palermini,
	who is under arrest, did the deed, because Tedaldo, who loved his
	wife, was come back to <placeName>Florence</placeName> incognito to forgather with her.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070012"/>Tedaldo found it passing strange that there should be any one so
      like him as to be mistaken for him, and deplored Aldobrandino's evil
      plight. He had learned, however, that the lady was alive and well.
      So, as 'twas now night, he hied him, much perplexed in mind, into
      the inn, and supped with his servant. The bedroom assigned him
      was almost at the top of the house, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070013"/>and the bed was none of the
      best. Thoughts many and disquieting haunted his mind, and his
      supper had been but light. Whereby it befell that midnight came and
      went, and Tedaldo was still awake. As thus he watched, he heard
      shortly after midnight, a noise as of persons descending from the roof
      into the house, and then through the chinks of the door of his room
      he caught the flicker of an ascending light. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070014"/>Wherefore he stole
      softly to the door, and peeping through a chink to make out what
      was afoot, he saw a very fine young woman bearing a light, and three
      men making towards her, being evidently those that had descended
      from the roof. The men exchanged friendly greetings with the
      young woman, and then one said to her: 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070015"/><q>Now, God be praised,
 we may make our minds easy, for we are well assured that judgment
 for the death of Tedaldo Elisei is gotten by his brothers against
 Aldobrandino Palermini, and he has confessed, and the sentence is
 already drawn up; but still it behoves us to hold our peace; for,
 should it ever get abroad that we were guilty, we shall stand in the
 like jeopardy as Aldobrandino.</q> So saying, they took leave of the
 woman, who seemed much cheered, and went to bed. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070016"/>What he
 had heard set Tedaldo musing on the number and variety of the
 errors to which men are liable: as, first, how his brothers had
 mourned and interred a stranger in his stead, and then charged an
 innocent man upon false suspicion, and by false witness brought him
 into imminent peril of death: from which he passed to ponder the
 blind severity of laws and magistrates, who from misguided zeal to
 elicit the truth not unfrequently become ruthless, and, adjudging that
 which is false, forfeit the title which they claim of ministers of
 <pb n="220"/>God and justice, and do but execute the mandates of iniquity and
 the Evil One. And so he came at last to consider the possibility
 of saving Aldobrandino, and formed a plan for the purpose. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070017"/>Accordingly,
 on the morrow, when he was risen, he left his servant at the
 inn, and hied him alone, at what he deemed a convenient time, to
 his lady's house, where, finding, by chance, the door open, he entered,
 and saw his lady sitting, all tears and lamentations, in a little parlour
 on the ground-floor. Whereat he all but wept for sympathy; and
 drawing near her, he said: 
<q>Madam, be not troubled in spirit: your peace is nigh you.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070018"/>Whereupon the lady raised her head, and said
 between her sobs: <q>Good man, what dost thou, a pilgrim, if I
 mistake not, from distant parts, know either of my peace or of my
 affliction?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070019"/><q>Madam,</q> returned the pilgrim, <q>I am of <placeName>Constantinople</placeName>,
 and am but now come hither, at God's behest, that I may give
 you laughter for tears, and deliver your husband from death.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070020"/><q>But,</q>
 said the lady, <q>if thou art of <placeName>Constantinople</placeName>, and but now arrived,
 how is 't that thou knowest either who my husband is, or who I
 am?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070021"/>Whereupon the pilgrim gave her the whole narrative, from
 the very beginning, of Aldobrandino's sufferings; he also told her,
 who she was, how long she had been married, and much besides that
 was known to him of her affairs: whereat the lady was lost in
 wonder, and, taking him to be a prophet, threw herself on her knees
 at his feet, and besought him for God's sake, if he were come to save
 Aldobrandino, to lose no time, for the matter brooked no delay. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070022"/>Thus
 adjured, the pilgrim assumed an air of great sanctity, as he said:
 <q>Arise, Madam, weep not, but hearken diligently to what I shall
 say to you, and look to it that you impart it to none. I have it by
 revelation of God that the tribulation wherein you stand is come
 upon you in requital of a sin which you did once commit, of which
 God is minded that this suffering be a partial purgation, and that you
 make reparation in full, if you would not find yourself in a far
 more grievous plight.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070023"/><q>Sir,</q> replied the lady, <q>many sins have I
 committed, nor know I how among them all to single out that
 whereof, more than another, God requires reparation at my hands:
 wherefore, if you know it, tell it me, and what by way of reparation
 I may do, that will I do.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070024"/><q>Madam,</q> returned the pilgrim, <q>well
 wot I what it is, nor shall I question you thereof for my better
 instruction, but that the rehearsal may give you increase of remorse
 <pb n="221"/>therefor. But pass we now to fact. Tell me, mind you ever to
 have had a lover?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070025"/>Whereat the lady heaved a deep sigh; then,
 marvelling not a little, for she had thought 'twas known to none,
 albeit on the day when the man was slain, who was afterwards buried
 as Tedaldo, there had been some buzz about it, occasioned by some
 indiscreet words dropped by Tedaldo's gossip and confidant, she made
 answer: 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070026"/><q>I see that there is nought that men keep secret but God
 reveals it to you; wherefore I shall not endeavour to hide my secrets
 from you. True it is that in my youth I was beyond measure
 enamoured of the unfortunate young man whose death is imputed to
 my husband; whom I mourned with grief unfeigned, for, albeit I
 shewed myself harsh and cruel towards him before his departure, yet
 neither thereby, nor by his long absence, nor yet by his calamitous
 death was my heart estranged from him.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070027"/>Then said the pilgrim:
 <q>'Twas not the unfortunate young man now dead that you did love,
 but Tedaldo Elisei. But let that pass; now tell me: wherefore lost
 he your good graces? Did he ever offend you?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070028"/><q>Nay verily,</q>
 answered the lady, <q>he never offended me at all. My harshness was
 prompted by an accursed friar, to whom I once confessed, and who,
 when I told him of the love I bore Tedaldo, and my intimacy with
 him, made my ears so tingle and sing that I still shudder to think of
 it, warning me that, if I gave it not up, I should fall into the jaws of
 the Devil in the abyss of hell, and be cast into the avenging fire.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070029"/>Whereby I was so terrified that I quite made my mind up to discontinue
 my intimacy with him, and, to trench the matter, I would
 thenceforth have none of his letters or messages; and so, I suppose,
 he went away in despair, though I doubt not, had he persevered a
 while longer, I should not have seen him wasting away like snow in
 sunshine without relenting of my harsh resolve; for in sooth there
 was nothing in the world I would so gladly have done.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070030"/>Then said
 the pilgrim: <q>Madam, 'tis this sin, and this only, that has brought
 upon you your present tribulation. I know positively that Tedaldo
 did never put force upon you: 'twas of your own free will, and for
 that he pleased you, that you became enamoured of him: your
 constant visitor, your intimate friend he became, because you yourself
 would have it so; and in the course of your intimacy you shewed
 him such favour by word and deed that, if he loved you first, you
 multiplied his love full a thousandfold. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070031"/>And if so it was, and well
 <pb n="222"/>yourself from him? You should have considered the whole matter
 before the die was cast, and not have entered upon it, if you deemed
 you might have cause to repent you of it as a sin. As soon as he
 became yours, you became his. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070032"/>Had he not been yours, you might
 have acted as you had thought fit, at your own unfettered discretion;
 but, as you were his, 'twas robbery, 'twas conduct most disgraceful,
 to sever yourself from him against his will. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070033"/>Now you must know
 that I am a friar; and therefore all the ways of friars are familiar to
 me; nor does it misbecome me, as it might another, to speak for
 your behoof somewhat freely of them; as I am minded to do that
 you may have better understanding of them in the future than you
 would seem to have had in the past. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070034"/>Time was when the friars were
 most holy and worthy men, but those who to-day take the name and
 claim the reputation of friars have nought of the friar save only the
 habit: nay, they have not even that: for, whereas their founders
 ordained that their habits should be strait, of a sorry sort, and of
 coarse stuff, apt symbols of a soul that in arraying the body in so mean
 a garb did despite to all things temporal, our modern friars will have
 them full, and double, and resplendent, and of the finest stuff, and of
 a fashion goodly and pontifical, wherein without shame they flaunt it
 like peacocks in the church, in the piazza, even as do the laity in their
 robes. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070035"/>And as the fisherman casts his net into the stream with
 intent to take many fish at one throw: so 'tis the main solicitude and
 study, art and craft of these friars to embrace and entangle within
 the ample folds of their vast swelling skirts beguines, widows and
 other foolish women, ay, and men likewise in great number. Wherefore,
 to speak with more exactitude, the friars of to-day have nought
 of the habit of the friar save only the colour thereof. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070036"/>And, whereas
 the friars of old time sought to win men to their salvation, those of
 to-day seek to win their women and their wealth; wherefore they
 have made it and make it their sole concern by declamation and
 imagery to strike terror into the souls of fools, and to make believe
 that sins are purged by alms and masses; to the end that they, base
 wretches that have fled to friarage not to ensue holiness but to escape
 hardship, may receive from this man bread, from that man wine, and
 from the other man a donation for masses for the souls of his dead.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070037"/>True indeed it is that sins are purged by almsgiving and prayer; but,
 did they who give the alms know, did they but understand to whom
 <pb n="223"/>or throw them to so many pigs. And, knowing that the fewer be
 they that share great riches, the greater their ease, 'tis the study of
 each how best by declamation and intimidation to oust others from
 that whereof he would fain be the sole owner. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070038"/>They censure lust in
 men, that, they turning therefrom, the sole use of their women may
 remain to the censors: they condemn usury and unlawful gains,
 that, being entrusted with the restitution thereof, they may be able
 to enlarge their habits, and to purchase bishoprics and other great
 preferments with the very money which they have made believe must
 bring its possessor to perdition. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070039"/>And when they are taxed with these
 and many other discreditable practices, they deem that there is no
 censure, however grave, of which they may not be quit by their glib
 formula: 'Follow our precepts, not our practice:' as if'twere possible
 that the sheep should be of a more austere and rigid virtue than the
 shepherds. And how many of these, whom they put off with this
 formula, understand it not in the way in which they enunciate it, not
 a few of them know. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070040"/>The friars of to-day would have you follow
 their precepts, that is to say, they would have you fill their purses
 with coin, confide to them your secrets, practise continence, be
 long-suffering,
 forgive those that trespass against you, keep yourselves from
 evil speaking; all which things are good, seemly, holy. But to what
 end? To the end that they may be able to do that which, if the
 laity do it, they will not be able to do. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070041"/>Who knows not that idleness
 cannot subsist without money? Spend thy money on thy pleasures,
 and the friar will not be able to live in sloth in his order. Go after
 women, and there will be no place for the friar. Be not long-suffering,
 pardon not the wrong-doer, and the friar will not dare to
 cross thy threshold to corrupt thy family. But wherefore pursue I
 the topic through every detail? <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070042"/>They accuse themselves as often
 as they so excuse themselves in the hearing of all that have understanding.
 Why seclude they not themselves, if they misdoubt
 their power to lead continent and holy lives? Or if they must
 needs not live as recluses, why follow they not that other holy
 text of the Gospel: Christ began to do and to teach?<note>As pointed out by
 Mr. Payne, these words are not from any of the
 Gospels, but from the first verse of the Acts of the Apostles. Boccaccio
 doubtless used <q><persName>Evangelio</persName></q> in a large sense for the whole of the New
 Testament.</note><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070043"/>Let
 <pb n="224"/>them practise first, and school us with their precepts afterwards. A
 thousand such have I seen in my day, admirers, lovers, philanderers,
 not of ladies of the world alone, but of nuns; ay, and they too such as
 made the most noise in the pulpits. Is it such as they that we are to
 follow? He that does so, pleases himself; but God knows if he do
 wisely. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070044"/>But assume that herein we must allow that your censor, the
 friar, spoke truth, to wit, that none may break the marriage-vow
 without very grave sin. What then? to rob a man, to slay him, to
 make of him an exile and a wanderer on the face of the earth, are not
 these yet greater sins? <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070045"/>None will deny that so they are. A woman
 that indulges herself in the intimate use with a man commits but a
 sin of nature; but if she rob him, or slay him, or drive him out into
 exile, her sin proceeds from depravity of spirit. That you did rob
 Tedaldo, I have already shewn you, in that, having of your own free
 will become his, you reft you from him. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070046"/>I now go further and say
 that, so far as in you lay, you slew him, seeing that, shewing yourself
 ever more and more cruel, you did your utmost to drive him to take
 his own life; and in the law's intent he that is the cause that wrong
 is done is as culpable as he that does it. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070047"/>Nor is it deniable that you
 were the cause that for seven years he has been an exile and a
 wanderer upon the face of the earth. Wherefore upon each of the
 said three articles you are found guilty of a greater crime than you
 committed by your intimacy with him. But consider we the matter
 more closely: perchance Tedaldo merited such treatment: nay, but
 assuredly 'twas not so. You have yourself so confessed: besides
 which I know that he loves you more dearly than himself. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070048"/>He
 would laud, he would extol, he would magnify you above all other
 ladies so as never was heard the like, wheresoever 'twas seemly for
 him to speak of you, and it might be done without exciting suspicion.
 All his bliss, all his honour, all his liberty he avowed was entirely in
 your disposal. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070049"/>Was he not of noble birth? And for beauty might
 he not compare with the rest of his townsfolk? Did he not excel in
 all the exercises and accomplishments proper to youth? Was he not
 beloved, held dear, well seen of all men? <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070050"/>You will not deny it.
 How then could you at the behest of a paltry friar, silly, brutish and
 envious, bring yourself to deal with him in any harsh sort? <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070051"/>I cannot
 estimate the error of those ladies who look askance on men and hold
 them cheap; whereas, bethinking them of what they are themselves,
 <pb n="225"/>and what and how great is the nobility with which God has endowed
 man above all the other animals, they ought rather to glory in the
 love which men give them, and hold them most dear, and with all
 zeal study to please them, that so their love may never fail. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070052"/>In what
 sort you did so, instigated by the chatter of a friar, some broth-guzzling,
 pastry-gorging knave without a doubt, you know; and peradventure
 his purpose was but to instal himself in the place whence he sought
 to oust another. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070053"/>This then is the sin which the Divine justice,
 which, ever operative, suffers no perturbation of its even balance,
 or arrest of judgment, has decreed not to leave unpunished: wherefore,
 as without due cause you devised how you might despoil
 Tedaldo of yourself, so without due cause your husband has been
 placed and is in jeopardy of his life on Tedaldo's account, and to
 your sore affliction. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070054"/>Wherefrom if you would be delivered, there
 is that which you must promise, ay, and (much more) which you
 must perform: to wit, that, should it ever betide that Tedaldo return
 hither from his long exile, you will restore to him your favour, your
 love, your tender regard, your intimacy, and reinstate him in the
 position which he held before you foolishly hearkened to the half-witted
 friar.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070055"/>Thus ended the pilgrim; and the lady, who had followed him
 with the closest attention, deeming all that he advanced very sound,
 and doubting not that her tribulation was, as he said, in requital of her
 sin, spoke thus: 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070056"/><q>Friend of God, well I wot that the matters
 which you discourse are true, and, thanks to your delineation, I now
 in great measure know what manner of men are the friars, whom
 I have hitherto regarded as all alike holy; nor doubt I that great
 was my fault in the course which I pursued towards Tedaldo; and
 gladly, were it in my power, would I make reparation in the manner
 which you have indicated. But how is this feasible? Tedaldo can
 never return to us. He is dead. Wherefore I know not why I
 must needs give you a promise which cannot be performed.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070057"/><q>Madam,</q> returned the pilgrim, <q>'tis revealed to me by God
 that Tedaldo is by no means dead, but alive and well and happy,
 so only he enjoyed your favour.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070058"/><q>Nay, but,</q> said the lady, <q>speak
 advisedly; I saw his body done to death by more than one knife-wound;
 I folded it in these arms, and drenched the dead face with
 many a tear; whereby, perchance, I gave occasion for the bruit that
 <pb n="226"/>has been made to my disadvantage.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070059"/><q>Say what you may, Madam,</q>
 rejoined the pilgrim, <q>I assure you that Tedaldo lives, and if you will
 but give the promise, then, for its fulfilment, I have good hope that
 you will soon see him.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070060"/>Whereupon: <q>I give the promise,</q>
 said the lady, <q>and right gladly will I make it good; nor is there
 aught that might happen that would yield me such delight as to see
 my husband free and scatheless, and Tedaldo alive.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070061"/>Tedaldo now
 deemed it wise to make himself known, and establish the lady in a
 more sure hope of her husband's safety. Wherefore he said:
 <q>Madam, to set your mind at ease in regard of your husband, I
 must first impart to you a secret, which be mindful to disclose to
 none so long as you live.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070062"/>Then--for such was the confidence
 which the lady reposed in the pilgrim's apparent sanctity that they
 were by themselves in a place remote from observation--Tedaldo
 drew forth a ring which he had guarded with the most jealous care,
 since it had been given him by the lady on the last night when they
 were together, and said, as he shewed it to her: <q>Madam, know
 you this?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070063"/>The lady recognized it forthwith, and answered: <q>I
 do, Sir; I gave it long ago to Tedaldo.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070064"/>Then the pilgrim, rising
 and throwing off his sclavine<note><!--(i)-->Schiavina<!--(/i)-->, Low Lat.
 <!--(i)-->sclavina<!--(/i)-->, the long coarse frock worn, among
 others, by palmers.</note> and hat, said with the Florentine
 accent: <q>And know you me?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070065"/>The lady recognizing forthwith
 the form and semblance of Tedaldo, was struck dumb with wonder
 and fear as of a corpse that is seen to go about as if alive, and was
 much rather disposed to turn and flee from Tedaldo returned from
 the tomb than to come forward and welcome Tedaldo arrived from
 <placeName>Cyprus</placeName>. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070066"/>But when Tedaldo said to her: <q>Fear not, Madam, your
 Tedaldo am I, alive and well, nor was I ever dead, whatever you
 and my brothers may think,</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070067"/>the lady, partly awed, partly reassured
 by his voice, regarded him with rather more attention, and inly
 affirming that 'twas in very truth Tedaldo, threw herself upon his
 neck, and wept, and kissed him, saying: <q>Sweet my Tedaldo,
 welcome home.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070068"/><q>Madam,</q> replied Tedaldo after he had kissed
 and embraced her, <q>time serves not now for greetings more intimate.
 'Tis for me to be up and doing, that Aldobrandino may be restored
 to you safe and sound; touching which matter you will, I trust,
 before to-morrow at even hear tidings that will gladden your heart;
 <pb n="227"/>indeed I expect to have good news to-night, and, if so, will come
 and tell it you, when I shall be less straitened than I am at present.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070069"/>He then resumed his sclavine and that, and having kissed the lady
 again, and bade her be of good cheer, took his leave, and hied him to
 the prison, where Aldobrandino lay more occupied with apprehension
 of imminent death than hope of deliverance to come. As ministrant
 of consolation, he gained ready admittance of the warders, and, seating
 himself by Aldobrandino's side, he said: 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070070"/><q>Aldobrandino, in me
 thou seest a friend sent thee by God, who is touched with pity of
 thee by reason of thy innocence; wherefore, if in reverent submission
 to Him thou wilt grant me a slight favour that I shall ask of thee,
 without fail, before to-morrow at even, thou shalt, in lieu of the
 doom of death that thou awaitest, hear thy acquittal pronounced.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070071"/><q>Worthy man,</q> replied Aldobrandino, <q>I know thee not, nor mind
 I ever to have seen thee; wherefore, as thou shewest thyself solicitous
 for my safety, my friend indeed thou must needs be, even as thou
 sayst. And in sooth the crime, for which they say I ought to be
 doomed to death, I never committed, though others enough I have
 committed, which perchance have brought me to this extremity.
 However, if so be that God has now pity on me, this I tell thee
 in reverent submission to Him, that, whereas 'tis but a little thing
 that thou cravest of me, there is nought, however great, but I would
 not only promise but gladly do it; wherefore, even ask what thou
 wilt, and, if so be that I escape, I will without fail keep my word to
 the letter.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070072"/><q>Nay,</q> returned the pilgrim, <q>I ask but this of thee,
 that thou pardon Tedaldo's four brothers, that in the belief that thou
 wast guilty of their brother's death they brought thee to this strait, and,
 so they ask thy forgiveness, account them as thy brothers and friends.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070073"/><q>How sweet,</q> replied Aldobrandino, <q>is the savour, how ardent the
 desire, of vengeance, none knows but he that is wronged; but yet, so
 God may take thought for my deliverance, I will gladly pardon, nay,
 I do now pardon them, and if I go hence alive and free, I will thenceforth
 have them in such regard as shall content thee.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070074"/>Satisfied with
 this answer, the pilgrim, without further parley, heartily exhorted
 Aldobrandino to be of good cheer; assuring him that, before the next
 day was done, he should be certified beyond all manner of doubt of
 his deliverance; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070075"/>and so he left him.</p><p>On quitting the prison the pilgrim hied him forthwith to the
 <pb n="228"/>signory, and being closeted with a knight that was in charge, thus
 spoke: <q>My lord, 'tis the duty of all, and most especially of those
 who hold your place, zealously to bestir themselves that the truth be
 brought to light, in order as well that those bear not the penalty
 who have not committed the crime, as that the guilty be punished.
 And that this may come to pass to your honour and the undoing
 of the delinquent, I am come hither to you. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070076"/>You wot that you
 have dealt rigorously with Aldobrandino Palermini, and have found,
 as you think, that 'twas he that slew Tedaldo Elisei, and you are
 about to condemn him; wherein you are most certainly in error, as
 I doubt not before midnight to prove to you, delivering the murderers
 into your hands.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070077"/>The worthy knight, who was not without pity
 for Aldobrandino, readily gave ear to the pilgrim's words. He
 conversed at large with him, and availing himself of his guidance,
 made an easy capture of the two brothers that kept the inn and their
 servant in their first sleep. He was about to put them the torture, to
 elicit the true state of the case, when, their courage failing, they
 confessed without the least reserve, severally at first, and then jointly,
 that 'twas they that had slain Tedaldo Elisei, not knowing who he
 was. Asked for why, they answered that 'twas because he had
 sorely harassed the wife of one of them, and would have constrained
 her to do his pleasure, while they were out of doors. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070078"/>Whereof the
 pilgrim was no sooner apprised, than by leave of the knight he withdrew,
 and hied him privily to the house of Madonna Ermellina, whom
 (the rest of the household being gone to bed) he found awaiting him
 alone, and equally anxious for good news of her husband and a
 complete reconciliation with her Tedaldo. On entering, he blithely
 exclaimed: <q>Rejoice, dearest my lady, for thou mayst rest assured
 that to-morrow thou shalt have thy Aldobrandino back here safe and
 sound;</q> and to confirm her faith in his words, he told her all that
 he had done. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070079"/>Greater joy was never woman's than hers of two such
 glad surprises; to wit, to have Tedaldo with her alive again, whom
 she had wailed for verily dead, and to know Aldobrandino, whom she
 had thought in no long time to wail for dead, now out of jeopardy.
 Wherefore, when she had affectionately embraced and kissed her
 Tedaldo, they hied them to bed together, and with hearty goodwill
 made gracious and gladsome consummation of their peace by
 interchange of sweet solace.</p><pb n="229"/><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070080"/>With the approach of day Tedaldo rose, and having first apprised
 the lady of his purpose and enjoined her, as before, to keep it most
 secret, resumed his pilgrim's habit, and sallied forth of her house,
 to be ready, as occasion should serve, to act in Aldobrandino's interest.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070081"/>As soon as 'twas day, the signory, deeming themselves amply conversant
 with the affair, set Aldobrandino at large; and a few days
 later they caused the malefactors to be beheaded in the place where
 they had done the murder.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070082"/>Great was Aldobrandino's joy to find himself free, nor less great
 was that of his lady and all his friends and kinsfolk; and as 'twas
 through the pilgrim that it had come about, they brought him to
 their house, there to reside as long as he cared to tarry in the city;
 nor could they do him honour and cheer enough, and most of all the
 lady, who knew her man. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070083"/>But after a while, seeing that his brothers
 were not only become a common laughing-stock by reason of Aldobrandino's
 acquittal, but had armed themselves for very fear, he felt
 that their reconciliation with him brooked no delay, and accordingly
 craved of him performance of his promise. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070084"/>Aldobrandino replied
 handsomely that it should be had at once. The pilgrim then bade
 him arrange for the following day a grand banquet, at which he and his
 kinsfolk and their ladies were to entertain the four brothers and their
 ladies, adding that he would himself go forthwith as Aldobrandino's
 envoy, and bid them welcome to his peace and banquet. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070085"/>All which
 being approved by Aldobrandino, the pilgrim hied him with all speed
 to the four brothers, whom by ample, apt and unanswerable argument
 he readily induced to reinstate themselves in Aldobrandino's friendship
 by suing for his forgiveness: which done, he bade them and their
 ladies to breakfast with Aldobrandino on the morrow, and they, being
 assured of his good faith, were consenting to come. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070086"/>So, on the
 morrow, at the breakfast hour, Tedaldo's four brothers, still wearing
 their black, came with certain of their friends to Aldobrandino's house,
 where he awaited them; and, in presence of the company that had
 been bidden to meet them, laid down their arms, and made surrender
 to Aldobrandino, asking his pardon of that which they had done
 against him. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070087"/>Aldobrandino received them compassionately, wept,
 kissed each on the mouth, and let few words suffice to remit each
 offence. After them came their sisters and their wives, all habited
 sadly, and were graciously received by Madonna Ermellina and the
 <pb n="230"/>other ladies. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070088"/>The guests, men and women alike, found all things
 ordered at the banquet with magnificence, nor aught unmeet for
 commendation save the restraint which the yet recent grief, betokened
 by the sombre garb of Tedaldo's kinsfolk, laid upon speech (wherein
 some had found matter to except against the banquet and the pilgrim
 for devising it, as he well knew), but, as he had premeditated, in due
 time, he stood up, the others being occupied with their dessert, and
 spoke thus: 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070089"/><q>Nothing is wanting to complete the gaiety of this
 banquet except the presence of Tedaldo; whom, as you have been
 long time with him and have not known him, I will point out to
 you.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070090"/>So, having divested himself of his sclavine and whatever else
 in his garb denoted the pilgrim, he remained habited in a tunic of
 green taffeta, in which guise, so great was the wonder with which all
 regarded him that, though they recognized him, 'twas long before
 any dared to believe that 'twas actually Tedaldo. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070091"/>Marking their
 surprise, Tedaldo told them not a little about themselves, their family
 connexions, their recent history, and his own adventures. Whereat
 his brothers and the rest of the men, all weeping for joy, hasted to
 embrace him, followed by the women, as well those that were not, as
 those that were, of kin to him, save only Madonna Ermellina. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070092"/>Which
 Aldobrandino observing, said: <q>What is this, Ermellina? How
 comes it that, unlike the other ladies, thou alone dost Tedaldo no
 cheer?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070093"/><q>Cheer,</q> replied the lady in the hearing of all, <q>would I
 gladly do him such as no other woman has done or could do, seeing
 that I am more beholden to him than any other woman, in that to
 him I owe it that I have thee with me again; 'tis but the words
 spoken to my disadvantage, while we mourned him that we deemed
 Tedaldo, that give me pause.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070094"/><q>Now out upon thee,</q> said
 Aldobrandino,
 <q>thinkest thou that I heed the yelping of these curs?
 His zeal for my deliverance has abundantly disproved it, besides which
 I never believed it. Quick, get thee up, and go and embrace him.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070095"/>The lady, who desired nothing better, was in this not slow to obey
 her husband; she rose forthwith, and embraced Tedaldo as the other
 ladies had done, and did him gladsome cheer. Tedaldo's brothers
 and all the company, men and women alike, heartily approved Aldobrandino's
 handsomeness; and so whatever of despite the rumour had
 engendered in the minds of any was done away. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070096"/>And, now that all
 had done him cheer, Tedaldo with his own hands rent his brothers'
 <pb n="231"/>suits of black upon their backs, as also the sad-hued garments which
 his sisters and sisters-in-law wore, and bade bring other apparel. Which
 when they had donned, there was no lack of singing, dancing and
 other sorts of merry-making; whereby the banquet, for all its subdued
 beginning, had a sonorous close. Then, just as they were, in the
 blithest of spirits, they hied them all to Tedaldo's house, where in
 the evening they supped; and in this manner they held festival for
 several days.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070097"/>'Twas some time before the Florentines ceased to look on Tedaldo
 as a portent, as if he were risen from the dead; and a shadow of doubt
 whether he were really Tedaldo or no continued to lurk in the minds
 of not a few, including even his brothers: they had no assured belief;
 and in that frame had perchance long continued, but for a casual
 occurrence that shewed them who the murdered man was. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070098"/>It so
 befell that one day some men-at-arms from <placeName>Lunigiana</placeName> passed by their
 house, and seeing Tedaldo accosted him, saying: <q>Good-morrow to
 thee, Faziuolo.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070099"/>To whom Tedaldo, in the presence of his brothers,
 answered: <q>You take me for another.</q> Whereat they were abashed,
 and asked his pardon, saying: <q>Sooth to tell, you are liker than we
 ever knew any man like to another to a comrade of ours, Faziuolo da
 Pontremoli by name, who came hither a fortnight ago, or perhaps a
 little more, since when we have not been able to learn what became
 of him. Most true it is that your dress surprised us, because he, like
 ourselves, was a soldier.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070100"/>Whereupon Tedaldo's eldest brother came
 forward, and asked how their comrade had been accoutred. They
 told him, and 'twas found to have been exactly as they said: by which
 and other evidence 'twas established that 'twas Faziuolo that had been
 murdered, and not Tedaldo; of whom thenceforth no suspicion
 lurked in the minds of his brothers or any one else.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03070101"/>So, then, Tedaldo returned home very rich, and remained constant
 in his love; nor did the lady again treat him harshly; but, using
 discretion, they long had mutual solace of their love. God grant us
 solace of ours.</p></div><pb n="232"/><!--***********************************Novella 8*********************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0308"><head>Novel VIII</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080001"/><!--(i)--><persName>Ferondo</persName>, having taken a certain powder, is interred for

 situate, as we see not a few, in a somewhat solitary spot, wherein the
 office of abbot was held by a monk, who in all other matters ordered
 his life with great sanctity, save only in the commerce with women,
 and therein knew so well how to cloak his indulgence, that scarce any
 there were that so much as suspected--not to say detected it--so
 holy and just was he reputed in all matters. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080005"/>Now the abbot consorted
 much with a very wealthy contadino, <persName>Ferondo</persName> by name, a
 man coarse and gross beyond measure, whose friendship the abbot
 only cared for because of the opportunities which it afforded of
 <pb n="233"/>deriving amusement from his simplicity; and during their intercourse
 the abbot discovered that <persName>Ferondo</persName> had a most beautiful wife; of
 whom he became so hotly enamoured that he could think of nought
 else either by day or by night. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080006"/>But learning that, however simple
 and inept in all other matters, <persName>Ferondo</persName> shewed excellent good sense
 in cherishing and watching over this wife of his, he almost despaired.
 However, being very astute, he prevailed so far with <persName>Ferondo</persName>, that he
 would sometimes bring his wife with him to take a little recreation
 in the abbey-garden, where he discoursed to them with all lowliness
 of the blessedness of life eternal, and the most pious works of many
 men and women of times past, insomuch that the lady conceived a
 desire to confess to him, and craved and had <persName>Ferondo</persName>'s leave therefor.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080007"/>So, to the abbot's boundless delight, the lady came and seated herself
 at his feet to make her confession, whereto she prefixed the following
 exordium: 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080008"/><q>If God, Sir, had given me a husband, or had not permitted
 me to have one, perchance 'twould be easy for me, under your
 guidance, to enter the way, of which you have spoken, that leads to
 life eternal. But, considering what manner of man <persName>Ferondo</persName> is, and
 his stupidity, I may call myself a widow, while yet I am married in
 that, so long as he lives, I may have no other husband; and he,
 fool that he is, is without the least cause so inordinately jealous of
 me that 'tis not possible but that my life with him be one of perpetual
 tribulation and woe. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080009"/>Wherefore, before I address myself to make
 further confession, I in all humility beseech you to be pleased to give
 me some counsel of this matter, for here or nowhere is to be found
 the source of the amelioration of my life, and if it be not found,
 neither confession nor any other good work will be of any avail.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080010"/>The abbot was overjoyed to hear her thus speak, deeming that
 Fortune had opened a way to the fulfilment of his heart's desire.
 Wherefore he said: <q>My daughter, I doubt not that 'tis a great
 affliction to a lady, fair and delicate as you are, to have a fool for a
 husband, and still more so that he should be jealous: and as your
 husband is both the one and the other, I readily credit what you say
 of your tribulation. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080011"/>But, to come to the point, I see no resource or
 remedy in this case, save this only, that <persName>Ferondo</persName> be cured of his
 jealousy. The medicine that shall cure him I know very well how
 to devise, but it behoves you to keep secret what I am about to tell
 you.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080012"/><q>Doubt not of it, my father,</q> said the lady; <q>for I had
 <pb n="234"/>rather suffer death than tell any aught that you forbade me to tell.
 But the medicine, how is it to be devised?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080013"/><q>If we would have
 him cured,</q> replied the abbot, <q>it can only be by his going to
 purgatory.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080014"/><q>And how may that be?</q> returned the lady; <q>can he go
 thither while he yet lives?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080015"/><q>He must die,</q> answered the abbot;
 <q>and so he will go thither; and when he has suffered pain enough to
 be cured of his jealousy, we have certain prayers with which we will
 supplicate God to restore him to life, and He will do so.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080016"/><q>Then,</q>
 said the lady; <q>am I to remain a widow?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080017"/><q>Yes,</q> replied the
 abbot, <q>for a certain time, during which you must be very careful
 not to let yourself be married to another, because 'twould offend God,
 and when <persName>Ferondo</persName> was restored to life, you would have to go back to
 him, and he would be more jealous than ever.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080018"/><q>Be it so then,</q>
 said the lady; <q>if he be but cured of his jealousy, and so I be not
 doomed to pass the rest of my days in prison, I shall be content: do
 as you think best.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080019"/><q>And so will I,</q> said the abbot; <q>but what
 reward shall I have for such a service?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080020"/><q>My father,</q> said the
 lady, <q>what you please; so only it be in my power. But what may
 the like of me do that may be acceptable to a man such as you?'
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080021"/><q>Madam,</q> replied the abbot, <q>'tis in your power to do no less for
 me than I am about to do for you: as that which I am minded to do
 will ensure your comfort and consolation, so there is that which you
 may do which will be the deliverance and salvation of my life.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080022"/><q>If
 so it be,</q> said the lady, <q>I shall not be found wanting.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080023"/><q>In that
 case,</q> said the abbot, <q>you will give me your love, and gratify my
 passion for you, with which I am all afire and wasting away.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080024"/>Whereto the lady, all consternation, replied: <q>Alas! my father, what
 is this you crave? I took you for a holy man; now does it beseem
 holy men to make such overtures to ladies that come to them for
 counsel?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080025"/><q>Marvel not, fair my soul,</q> returned the abbot; 
	<q>hereby
	  is my holiness in no wise diminished, for holiness resides in the
	  soul, and this which I ask of you is but a sin of the flesh. But, however
	  it may be, such is the might of your bewitching beauty, that
	  love constrains me thus to act. And, let me tell you, good cause
	  have you to vaunt you of your beauty more than other women, in
	  that it delights the saints, who are used to contemplate celestial
	  beauties; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080026"/>whereto I may add that, albeit I am an abbot, yet I am a
	  man even as others, and, as you see, not yet old. Nor need this
	  <pb n="235"/>matter seem formidable to you, but rather to be anticipated with
	  pleasure, for, while <persName>Ferondo</persName> is in purgatory, I shall be your nightly
	  companion, and will give you such solace as he should have given you;
	  nor will it ever be discovered by any, for all think of me even as you
	  did a while ago, or even more so. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080027"/>Reject not the grace that God
	  accords you; for 'tis in your power to have, and, if you are wise and
	  follow my advice, you shall have that which women not a few desire
	  in vain to have. And moreover I have jewels fair and rare, which I
	  am minded shall be yours and none other's. Wherefore, sweet my
	  hope, deny me not due guerdon of the service which I gladly render
	  you.</q></q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080028"/>The lady, her eyes still downcast, knew not how to deny him,
 and yet scrupled to gratify him: wherefore the abbot, seeing that
 she had hearkened and hesitated to answer, deemed that she was
 already half won, and following up what he had said with much more
 to the like effect, did not rest until he had persuaded her that she
 would do well to comply: and so with some confusion she told him
 that she was ready to obey his every behest; but it might not be until
 <persName>Ferondo</persName> was in purgatory. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080029"/>The abbot, well content, replied: 
<q>And
 we will send him thither forthwith: do but arrange that he come
 hither to stay with me to-morrow or the day after.</q> Which said, he
 slipped a most beautiful ring on her finger, and dismissed her.
 Pleased with the gift, and expecting more to come, the lady rejoined
 her attendants, with whom she forthwith fell a talking marvellous
 things of the abbot's sanctity, and so went home with them.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080030"/>Some few days after, <persName>Ferondo</persName> being come to the abbey, the abbot
 no sooner saw him than he resolved to send him to purgatory. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080031"/>So he
 selected from among his drugs a powder of marvellous virtue, which
 he had gotten in the Levant from a great prince, who averred that
 'twas wont to be used by the Old Man of the Mountain, when he
 would send any one to or bring him from his paradise, and that,
 without doing the recipient any harm, 'twould induce in him, according
 to the quantity of the dose, a sleep of such duration and quality that,
 while the efficacy of the powder lasted, none would deem him to be
 alive.<note>By the Old Man of the Mountain is meant the head of the
 confraternity
 of hashish-eaters (Assassins), whose chief stronghold was at Alamut in
 <placeName>Persia</placeName> (1090-1256). Cf. Marco Polo, ed. Yule, I. cap. xxiii.</note>
 Whereof he took enough to cause a three days' sleep, and
 <pb n="236"/>gave it to <persName>Ferondo</persName> in his cell in a beaker that had still some wine in
 it, so that he drank it unwittingly: after which he took <persName>Ferondo</persName> to
 the cloister, and there with some of his monks fell to making merry
 with him and his ineptitudes. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080032"/>In no long time, however, the
 powder so wrought, that <persName>Ferondo</persName> was seized in the head with a fit
 of somnolence so sudden and violent that he slept as he stood, and
 sleeping fell to the ground. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080033"/>The abbot put on an agitated air, caused
 him to be untrussed, sent for cold water, and had it sprinkled on his
 face, and applied such other remedies as if he would fain call back
 life and sense banished by vapours of the stomach, or some other
 intrusive force; but, as, for all that he and his monks did, <persName>Ferondo</persName>
 did not revive, they, after feeling his pulse and finding there no
 sign of life, one and all pronounced him certainly dead. Wherefore
 they sent word to his wife and kinsfolk, who came forthwith, and
 mourned a while; after which <persName>Ferondo</persName> in his clothes was by the
 abbot's order laid in a tomb. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080034"/>The lady went home, saying that
 nothing should ever part her from a little son that she had borne
 <persName>Ferondo</persName>; and so she occupied herself with the care of her son and
 <persName>Ferondo</persName>'s estate. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080035"/>At night the abbot rose noiselessly, and with the
 help of a Bolognese monk, in whom he reposed much trust, and who
 was that very day arrived from <placeName>Bologna</placeName>, got <persName>Ferondo</persName> out of the
 tomb, and bore him to a vault, which admitted no light, having been
 made to serve as a prison for delinquent monks; and having stripped
 him of his clothes, and habited him as a monk, they laid him on a
 truss of straw, and left him there until he should revive. Expecting
 which event, and instructed by the abbot how he was then to act,
 the Bolognese monk (none else knowing aught of what was afoot)
 kept watch by the tomb.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080036"/>The day after, the abbot with some of his monks paid a pastoral
 visit to the lady's house, where he found her in mourning weeds and
 sad at heart; and, after administering a little consolation, he gently
 asked her to redeem her promise. Free as she now felt herself, and
 hampered neither by <persName>Ferondo</persName> nor by any other, the lady, who had
 noticed another beautiful ring on the abbot's finger, promised immediate
 compliance, and arranged with the abbot that he should visit
 her the very next night. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080037"/>So, at nightfall, the abbot donned <persName>Ferondo</persName>'s
 clothes, and, attended by his monk, paid his visit, and lay with her
 until matins to his immense delight and solace, and so returned to
 <pb n="237"/>the abbey; and many visits he paid her on the same errand; whereby
 some that met him, coming or going that way, supposed that 'twas
 <persName>Ferondo</persName> perambulating those parts by way of penance; and fables
 not a few passed from mouth to mouth of the foolish rustics, and
 sometimes reached the ears of the lady, who was at no loss to account
 for them.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080038"/>As for <persName>Ferondo</persName>, when he revived, 'twas only to find himself he
 knew not where, while the Bolognese monk entered the tomb, gibbering
 horribly, and armed with a rod, wherewith, having laid hold of
 <persName>Ferondo</persName>, he gave him a severe thrashing. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080039"/>Blubbering and bellowing
 for pain, <persName>Ferondo</persName> could only ejaculate: <q>Where am I?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080040"/><q>In purgatory,</q> replied the monk. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080041"/><q>How?</q> returned <persName>Ferondo</persName>, <q>am I dead then?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080042"/>and the monk assuring him that 'twas even so, he
 fell a bewailing his own and his lady's and his son's fate, after the
 most ridiculous fashion in the world. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080043"/>The monk brought him
 somewhat to eat and drink. Of which when <persName>Ferondo</persName> caught sight,
 <q>Oh!</q> said he, <q>dead folk eat then, do they?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080044"/><q>They do,</q>
 replied the monk; <q>and this, which I bring thee, is what the lady
 that was thy wife sent this morning to the church by way of alms
 for masses for thy soul; and God is minded that it be assigned to
 thee.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080045"/><q>Now God grant her a happy year,</q> said <persName>Ferondo</persName>; <q>dearly
 I loved her while I yet lived, and would hold her all night long in
 my arms, and cease not to kiss her, ay, and would do yet more to her,
 when I was so minded.</q> Whereupon he fell to eating and drinking
 with great avidity, and finding the wine not much to his taste, he
 said: <q>Now God do her a mischief! Why gave she not the priest
 of the wine that is in the cask by the wall?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080046"/>When he had done
 eating, the monk laid hold of him again, and gave him another sound
 thrashing with the rod. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080047"/><persName>Ferondo</persName> bellowed mightily, and then cried
 out: <q>Alas! why servest thou me so?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080048"/><q>God,</q> answered the monk, <q>has decreed that thou be so served twice a day.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080049"/><q>For why?</q> said <persName>Ferondo</persName>. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080050"/><q>Because,</q> returned the monk, <q>thou wast
 jealous, notwithstanding thou hadst to wife a woman that has not her
 peer in thy countryside.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080051"/><q>Alas,</q> said <persName>Ferondo</persName>, <q>she was indeed
 all that thou sayst, ay, and the sweetest creature too,--no comfit so
 honeyed--but I knew not that God took it amiss that a man should
 be jealous, or I had not been so.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080052"/><q>Of that,</q> replied the monk,
 <q>thou shouldst have bethought thee while thou wast there, and have
 <pb n="238"/>amended thy ways; and should it fall to thy lot ever to return thither,
 be sure that thou so lay to heart the lesson that I now give thee, that
 thou be no more jealous.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080053"/><q>Oh!</q> said <persName>Ferondo</persName>; <q>dead folk sometimes
 return to earth, do they?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080054"/><q>They do,</q> replied the monk; <q>if God so will.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080055"/><q>Oh!</q> said <persName>Ferondo</persName>; <q>if I ever return, I will
 be the best husband in the world; never will I beat her or scold her,
 save for the wine that she has sent me this morning, and also for
 sending me never a candle, so that I have had perforce to eat in the
 dark.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080056"/><q>Nay,</q> said the monk, <q>she sent them, but they were burned
 at the masses.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080057"/><q>Oh!</q> said <persName>Ferondo</persName>, <q>I doubt not you say true;
 and, of a surety, if I ever return, I will let her do just as she likes.
 But tell me, who art thou that entreatest me thus?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080058"/><q>Late of
 <placeName>Sardinia</placeName> I,</q> answered the monk, <q>dead too; and, for that I gave
 my lord much countenance in his jealousy, doomed by God for
 my proper penance to entreat thee thus with food and drink and
 thrashings, until such time as He may ordain otherwise touching
 thee and me.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080059"/><q>And are we two the only folk here?</q> inquired
 <persName>Ferondo</persName>. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080060"/><q>Nay, there are thousands beside,</q> answered the monk;
 <q>but thou canst neither see nor hear them, nor they thee.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080061"/><q>And how far,</q> said <persName>Ferondo</persName>, <q>may we be from our country?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080062"/><q>Oh! ho!</q> returned the monk, <q>why, 'tis some miles clean out of
 shitrange.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080063"/><q>I'faith,</q> said <persName>Ferondo</persName>, <q>that is far indeed: methinks we
 must be out of the world.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080064"/>In such a course, alternately beaten, fed and amused with idle
 tales, was <persName>Ferondo</persName> kept for ten months, while the abbot, to his great
 felicity, paid many a visit to the fair lady, and had the jolliest time in
 the world with her. But, as misfortunes will happen, the lady
 conceived, which fact, as soon as she was aware of it, she imparted to
 the abbot; whereupon both agreed that <persName>Ferondo</persName> must without delay
 be brought back from purgatory to earth and her, and be given to
 understand that she was with child of him. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080065"/>So the very next night
 the abbot went to the prison, and in a disguised voice pronounced
 <persName>Ferondo</persName>'s name, and said to him: <q><persName>Ferondo</persName>, be of good cheer, for
 God is minded that thou return to earth; and on thy return thou
 shalt have a son by thy lady, and thou shalt call him Benedetto;
 because 'tis in answer to the prayers of thy holy abbot and thy lady,
 and for love of St. Benedict, that God accords thee this grace.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080066"/>Whereat <persName>Ferondo</persName> was overjoyed, and said: <q>It likes me well.
 <pb n="239"/>God give a good year to Master Lord God, and the abbot, and St.
 Benedict, and my cheese-powdered, honey-sweet wife.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080067"/>Then, in
 the wine that he sent him, the abbot administered enough of the
 powder to cause him to sleep for four hours; and so, with the aid of
 the monk, having first habited him in his proper clothes, he privily
 conveyed him back to the tomb in which he had been buried. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080068"/>On
 the morrow at daybreak <persName>Ferondo</persName> revived, and perceiving through a
 chink in the tomb a glimmer of light, to which he had been a
 stranger for full ten months, he knew that he was alive, and began
 to bellow: <q>Let me out, let me out:</q> then, setting his head to
 the lid of the tomb, he heaved amain; whereby the lid, being insecure,
 started; and he was already thrusting it aside, when the monks,
 matins being now ended, ran to the spot and recognized <persName>Ferondo</persName>'s
 voice, and saw him issue from the tomb; by which unwonted event
 they were all so affrighted that they took to flight, and hied them to
 the abbot: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080069"/>who, rising as if from prayer, said: <q>Sons, be not
 afraid; take the cross and the holy water, and follow me, and let us
 see what sign of His might God will vouchsafe us.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080070"/>And so
 he led the way to the tomb; beside which they found <persName>Ferondo</persName>
 standing, deathly pale by reason of his long estrangement from the
 light. On sight of the abbot he ran and threw himself at his feet,
 saying: <q>My father, it has been revealed to me that 'tis to your
 prayers and those of St. Benedict and my lady that I owe my release
 from purgatorial pain, and restoration to life; wherefore 'tis my
 prayer that God give you a good year and good calends, to-day and
 all days.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080071"/><q>Laud we the power of God!</q> said the abbot. <q>Go
 then, son, as God has restored thee to earth, comfort thy wife, who,
 since thou didst depart this life, has been ever in tears, and mayst thou
 live henceforth in the love and service of God.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080072"/><q>Sir,</q> answered
 <persName>Ferondo</persName>, <q>'tis well said; and, for the doing, trust me that, as soon as
 I find her, I shall kiss her, such is the love I bear her.</q> So saying,
 he went his way; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080073"/>and the abbot, left alone with his monks, made
 as if he marvelled greatly at the affair, and caused devoutly chant
 the Miserere. So <persName>Ferondo</persName> returned to his hamlet, where all that
 saw him fleeing, as folk are wont to flee from spectacles of horror,
 he called them back, asseverating that he was risen from the tomb.
 His wife at first was no less timorous: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080074"/>but, as folk began to take heart
 of grace, perceiving that he was alive, they plied him with many
 <pb n="240"/>questions, all which he answered as one that had returned with ripe
 experience, and gave them tidings of the souls of their kinsfolk, and
 told of his own invention the prettiest fables of the purgatorial state,
 and in full folkmoot recounted the revelation vouchsafed him by the
 mouth of Ragnolo Braghiello<note>Derisively for Agnolo Gabriello (the
 <!--(i)-->h<!--(/i)--> having merely the effect of
 preserving the hardness of the <!--(i)-->g<!--(/i)--> before <!--(i)-->i<!--(/i)-->), <!--(i)-->
i.e.<!--(/i)--> Angel Gabriel.</note> before his resuscitation.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080075"/>Thus was <persName>Ferondo</persName> reinstated in his property and reunited to his
 wife, who, being pregnant, as he thought, by himself, chanced by
 the time of her delivery to countenance the vulgar error that the
 woman must bear the infant in the womb for exactly nine months,
 and gave birth to a male child, who was named Benedetto Ferondi.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03080076"/><persName>Ferondo</persName>'s return from purgatory, and the report he brought thence,
 immeasurably enhanced the fame of the abbot's holiness. So
 <persName>Ferondo</persName>, cured of his jealousy by the thrashings which he had gotten
 for it, verified the abbot's prediction, and never offended the lady
 again in that sort. Wherefore she lived with him, as before, in all
 outward seemliness; albeit she failed not, as occasion served, to forgather
 with the holy abbot, who had so well and sedulously served
 her in her especial need.</p></div><pb n="241"/><!--***********************************Novella 9*********************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0309"><head>Novel IX</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090001"/><!--(i)-->Gillette of Narbonne cures the King of <placeName>France</placeName> of a fistula,

 to complete the day's narration. However, for what it may be worth,
 I will tell you a story which seems to me germane to our theme.</p></body></floatingText><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090004"/>Know, then, that in the realm of <placeName>France</placeName> there was a gentleman,
 Isnard, Comte de Roussillon, by name, who, being in ill-health, kept
 ever in attendance on him a physician, one Master Gerard of Narbonne.
 The said Count had an only son named Bertrand, a very
 fine and winsome little lad; with whom were brought up other
 children of his own age, among them the said physician's little
 daughter Gillette; who with a love boundless and ardent out of all
 keeping with her tender years became enamoured of this Bertrand.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090005"/>And so, when the Count died, and his son, being left a ward of the
 King, must needs go to <placeName>Paris</placeName>, the girl remained beside herself with
 <pb n="242"/>grief, and, her father dying soon after, would gladly have gone to
 <placeName>Paris</placeName> to see Bertrand, might she but have found a fair excuse; but no
 decent pretext could she come by, being left a great and sole heiress
 and very closely guarded. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090006"/>So being come of marriageable age, still
 cherishing Bertrand's memory, she rejected not a few suitors, to
 whom her kinsfolk would fain have married her, without assigning
 any reason.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090007"/>Now her passion waxing ever more ardent for Bertrand, as she
 learned that he was grown a most goodly gallant, tidings reached
 her that the King of <placeName>France</placeName>, in consequence of a tumour which he
 had had in the breast, and which had been ill tended, was now
 troubled with a fistula, which occasioned him extreme distress and
 suffering; nor had he as yet come by a physician that was able,
 though many had essayed, to cure him, but had rather grown worse
 under their hands; wherefore in despair he was minded no more to
 have recourse to any for counsel or aid. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090008"/>Whereat the damsel was
 overjoyed, deeming not only that she might find therein lawful occasion
 to go to <placeName>Paris</placeName>, but, that, if the disease was what she took it to be,
 it might well betide that she should be wedded to Bertrand. So--for
 not a little knowledge had she gotten from her father--she prepared
 a powder from certain herbs serviceable in the treatment of the supposed
 disease, and straightway took horse, and hied her to <placeName>Paris</placeName>.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090009"/>Arrived there she made it her first concern to have sight of Bertrand;
 and then, having obtained access to the King, she besought
 him of his grace to shew her his disease. The King knew not how
 to refuse so young, fair and winsome a damsel, and let her see the
 place. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090010"/>Whereupon, no longer doubting that she should cure him, she
 said: <q>Sire, so please you, I hope in God to cure you of this malady
 within eight days without causing you the least distress or discomfort.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090011"/>The King inly scoffed at her words, saying to himself:
 <q>How should a damsel have come by a knowledge and skill that
 the greatest physicians in the world do not possess?</q> He therefore
 graciously acknowledged her good intention, and answered
 that he had resolved no more to follow advice of physician.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090012"/><q>Sire,</q> said the damsel, <q>you disdain my art, because I am young
 and a woman; but I bid you bear in mind that I rely not on
 my own skill, but on the help of God, and the skill of Master
 Gerard of Narbonne, my father, and a famous physician in his day.</q><pb n="243"/><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090013"/>Whereupon the King said to himself: <q>Perchance she is sent me by
 God; why put I not her skill to the proof, seeing that she says that
 she can cure me in a short time, and cause me no distress?</q> And
 being minded to make the experiment, he said: <q>Damsel, and if,
 having caused me to cancel my resolve, you should fail to cure me,
 what are you content should ensue?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090014"/><q>Sire,</q> answered the damsel,
 <q>set a guard upon me; and if within eight days I cure you not, have
 me burned; but if I cure you, what shall be my guerdon?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090015"/><q>You
 seem,</q> said the King, <q>to be yet unmarried; if you shall effect the
 cure, we will marry you well and in high place.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090016"/><q>Sire,</q> returned
 the damsel, <q>well content indeed am I that you should marry me,
 so it be to such a husband as I shall ask of you, save that I may not
 ask any of your sons or any other member of the royal house.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090017"/>Whereto the King forthwith consented, and the damsel, thereupon
 applying her treatment, restored him to health before the period
 assigned. Wherefore, as soon as the King knew that he was cured:
 <q>Damsel,</q> said he, <q>well have you won your husband.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090018"/>She
 answered: <q>In that case, Sire, I have won Bertrand de Roussillon,
 of whom, while yet a child, I was enamoured, and whom I have
 ever since most ardently loved.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090019"/>To give her Bertrand seemed to
 the King no small matter; but, having pledged his word, he would
 not break it: so he sent for Bertrand, and said to him: <q>Bertrand,
 you are now come to man's estate, and fully equipped to enter on it;
 'tis therefore our will that you go back and assume the governance
 of your county, and that you take with you a damsel, whom we have
 given you to wife.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090020"/><q>And who is the damsel, Sire?</q> said Bertrand.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090021"/><q>She it is,</q> answered the King, <q>that has restored us to health by
 her physic.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090022"/>Now Bertrand, knowing Gillette, and that her lineage
 was not such as matched his nobility, albeit, seeing her, he had found
 her very fair, was overcome with disdain, and answered: <q>So, Sire,
 you would fain give me a she-doctor to wife. Now God forbid that
 I should ever marry any such woman.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090023"/><q>Then,</q> said the King,
 <q>you would have us fail of the faith which we pledged to the damsel,
 who asked you in marriage by way of guerdon for our restoration to
 health.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090024"/><q>Sire,</q> said Bertrand, <q>you may take from me all that
 I possess, and give me as your man to whomsoever you may be
 minded; but rest assured that I shall never be satisfied with such a
 match.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090025"/><q>Nay, but you will,</q> replied the King; <q>for the damsel
 <pb n="244"/>is fair and discreet, and loves you well; wherefore we anticipate that
 you will live far more happily with her than with a dame of much
 higher lineage.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090026"/>Bertrand was silent; and the King made great
 preparations for the celebration of the nuptials. The appointed day
 came, and Bertrand, albeit reluctantly, nevertheless complied, and in
 the presence of the King was wedded to the damsel, who loved him
 more dearly than herself. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090027"/>Which done, Bertrand, who had already
 taken his resolution, said that he was minded to go down to his
 county, there to consummate the marriage; and so, having craved and
 had leave of absence of the King, he took horse, but instead of
 returning to his county he hied him to <placeName>Tuscany</placeName>; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090028"/>where, finding the
 Florentines at war with the Sienese, he determined to take service
 with the Florentines, and being made heartily and honourably welcome,
 was appointed to the command of part of their forces, at a
 liberal stipend, and so remained in their service for a long while.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090029"/>Distressed by this turn of fortune, and hoping by her wise management
 to bring Bertrand back to his county, the bride hied her
 to <placeName>Roussillon</placeName>, where she was received by all the tenants as their
 liege lady. She found that, during the long absence of the lord,
 everything had fallen into decay and disorder; which, being a capable
 woman, she rectified with great and sedulous care, to the great joy of
 the tenants, who held her in great esteem and love, and severely
 censured the Count, that he was not satisfied with her. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090030"/>When the
 lady had duly ordered all things in the county, she despatched two
 knights to the Count with the intelligence, praying him, that, if 'twas
 on her account that he came not home, he would so inform her; in
 which case she would gratify him by departing. To whom with all
 harshness he replied: <q>She may even please herself in the matter.
 For my part I will go home and live with her, when she has this ring
 on her finger and a son gotten of me upon her arm.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090031"/>The ring was
 one which he greatly prized, and never removed from his finger, by
 reason of a virtue which he had been given to understand that it
 possessed. The knights appreciated the harshness of a condition
 which contained two articles, both of which were all but impossible;
 and, seeing that by no words of theirs could they alter his resolve,
 they returned to the lady, and delivered his message. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090032"/>Sorely distressed,
 the lady after long pondering determined to try how and
 where the two conditions might be satisfied, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090033"/>that so her husband
 <pb n="245"/>might be hers again. Having formed her plan, she assembled certain
 of the more considerable and notable men of the county, to whom
 she gave a consecutive and most touching narrative of all that she
 had done for love of the Count, with the result; concluding by
 saying that she was not minded to tarry there to the Count's perpetual
 exile, but to pass the rest of her days in pilgrimages and pious
 works for the good of her soul: wherefore she prayed them to undertake
 the defence and governance of the county, and to inform the
 Count that she had made entire and absolute cession of it to him,
 and was gone away with the intention of never more returning to
 <placeName>Roussillon</placeName>. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090034"/>As she spoke, tears not a few coursed down the cheeks
 of the honest men, and again and again they besought her to change
 her mind, and stay. All in vain, however; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090035"/>she commended them
 to God, and, accompanied only by one of her male cousins and a
 chambermaid (all three habited as pilgrims and amply provided with
 money and precious jewels), she took the road, nor tarried until she
 was arrived at <placeName>Florence</placeName>. There she lodged in a little inn kept by a
 good woman that was a widow, bearing herself lowly as a poor
 pilgrim, and eagerly expectant of news of her lord.</p><p>Now it so befell that the very next day she saw Bertrand pass
 in front of the inn on horseback at the head of his company; and
 though she knew him very well, nevertheless she asked the good
 woman of the inn who he was. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090036"/>The hostess replied: <q>'Tis a
 foreign gentleman--Count Bertrand they call him--a very pleasant
 gentleman, and courteous, and much beloved in this city; and he is
 in the last degree enamoured of one of our neighbours here, who is a
 gentlewoman, but in poor circumstances. A very virtuous damsel
 she is too, and, being as yet unmarried by reason of her poverty, she
 lives with her mother, who is an excellent and most discreet lady,
 but for whom, perchance, she would before now have yielded and
 gratified the Count's desire.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090037"/>No word of this was lost on the lady;
 she pondered and meditated every detail with the closest attention,
 and having laid it all to heart, took her resolution: she ascertained
 the names and abode of the lady and her daughter that the Count
 loved, and hied her one day privily, wearing her pilgrim's weeds, to
 their house, where she found the lady and her daughter in very
 evident poverty, and after greeting them, told the lady that, if it
 were agreeable to her, she would speak with her. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090038"/>The gentlewoman
 <pb n="246"/>rose and signified her willingness to listen to what she had to say;
 so they went into a room by themselves and sate down, and then
 the Countess began thus: <q>Madam, methinks you are, as I am,
 under Fortune's frown; but perchance you have it in your power,
 if you are so minded, to afford solace to both of us.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090039"/>The lady
 answered that, so she might honourably find it, solace indeed was
 what she craved most of all things in the world. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090040"/>Whereupon the
 Countess continued: <q>I must first be assured of your faith, wherein
 if I confide and am deceived, the interests of both of us will suffer.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090041"/><q>Have no fear,</q> said the gentlewoman, <q>speak your whole mind
 without reserve, for you will find that there is no deceit in me.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090042"/>So the Countess told who she was, and the whole course of her love
 affair, from its commencement to that hour, on such wise that the
 gentlewoman, believing her story the more readily that she had
 already heard it in part from others, was touched with compassion
 for her. The narrative of her woes complete, the Countess added:
 <q>Now that you have heard my misfortunes, you know the two
 conditions that I must fulfil, if I would come by my husband; nor
 know I any other person than you, that may enable me to fulfil
 them; but so you may, if this which I hear is true, to wit, that
 my husband is in the last degree enamoured of your daughter.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090043"/><q>Madam,</q> replied the gentlewoman, <q>I know not if the Count
 loves my daughter, but true it is that he makes great shew of loving
 her; but how may this enable me to do aught for you in the matter
 that you have at heart?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090044"/><q>The how, madam,</q> returned the
 Countess, <q>I will shortly explain to you; but you shall first hear
 what I intend shall ensue, if you serve me. Your daughter, I see, is
 fair and of marriageable age, and, by what I have learned and may
 well understand, 'tis because you have not the wherewith to marry
 her that you keep her at home. Now, in recompense of the service
 that you shall do me, I mean to provide her forthwith from my own
 moneys with such a dowry as you yourself shall deem adequate for
 her marriage.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090045"/>The lady was too needy not to be gratified by the
 proposal; but, nevertheless, with the true spirit of the gentlewoman,
 she answered: <q>Nay but, madam, tell me that which I may do
 for you, and if it shall be such as I may honourably do, gladly will I
 do it, and then you shall do as you may be minded.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090046"/>Said then the
 Countess: <q>I require of you, that through some one in whom you
 <pb n="247"/>trust you send word to the Count, my husband, that your daughter
 is ready to yield herself entirely to his will, so she may be sure that
 he loves her even as he professes; whereof she will never be convinced,
 until he send her the ring which he wears on his finger, and
 which, she understands, he prizes so much: which, being sent, you
 shall give to me, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090047"/>and shall then send him word that your daughter
 is ready to do his pleasure, and, having brought him hither secretly,
 you shall contrive that I lie by his side instead of your daughter.
 Perchance, by God's grace I shall conceive, and so, having his ring
 on my finger, and a son gotten of him on my arm, shall have him
 for my own again, and live with him even as a wife should live with
 her husband, and owe it all to you.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090048"/>The lady felt that 'twas not a little that the Countess craved of her,
 for she feared lest it should bring reproach upon her daughter: but
 she reflected that to aid the good lady to recover her husband was
 an honourable enterprise, and that in undertaking it she would be
 subserving a like end; and so, trusting in the good and virtuous
 disposition of the Countess, she not only promised to do as she was
 required, but in no long time, proceeding with caution and secrecy,
 as she had been bidden, she both had the ring from the Count, loath
 though he was to part with it, and cunningly contrived that the
 Countess should lie with him in place of her daughter. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090049"/>In which
 first commingling, so ardently sought by the Count, it so pleased
 God that the lady was gotten, as in due time her delivery made
 manifest, with two sons. Nor once only, but many times did the
 lady gratify the Countess with the embraces of her husband, using
 such secrecy that no word thereof ever got wind, the Count all the
 while supposing that he lay, not with his wife, but with her that he
 loved, and being wont to give her, as he left her in the morning,
 some fair and rare jewel, which she jealously guarded.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090050"/>When she perceived that she was with child, the Countess, being
 minded no more to burden the lady with such service, said to her:
 <q>Madam, thanks be to God and to you, I now have that which I
 desired, and therefore 'tis time that I make you grateful requital, and
 take my leave of you.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090051"/>The lady answered that she was glad if the
 Countess had gotten aught that gave her joy; but that 'twas not as
 hoping to have guerdon thereof that she had done her part, but
 simply because she deemed it meet and her duty so to do. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090052"/><q>Well
 <pb n="248"/>said, madam,</q> returned the Countess, <q>and in like manner that
 which you shall ask of me I shall not give you by way of guerdon,
 but because I deem it meet and my duty to give it.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090053"/>Whereupon
 the lady, yielding to necessity, and abashed beyond measure, asked of
 her a hundred pounds wherewith to marry her daughter. The
 Countess, marking her embarrassment, and the modesty of her
 request, gave her five hundred pounds besides jewels fair and rare,
 worth, perhaps, no less; and having thus much more than contented
 her, and received her superabundant thanks, she took leave of her and
 returned to the inn. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090054"/>The lady, to render purposeless further visits or
 messages on Bertrand's part, withdrew with her daughter to the
 house of her kinsfolk in the country; nor was it long before Bertrand,
 on the urgent entreaty of his vassals and intelligence of the departure
 of his wife, quitted <placeName>Florence</placeName> and returned home. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090055"/>Greatly elated by
 this intelligence, the Countess tarried awhile in <placeName>Florence</placeName>, and was
 there delivered of two sons as like as possible to their father, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090056"/>whom
 she nurtured with sedulous care. But by and by she saw fit to take
 the road, and being come, unrecognized by any, to <placeName>Montpellier</placeName>,
 rested there a few days; and being on the alert for news of the
 Count and where he was, she learned that on All Saints' day he
 was to hold a great reception of ladies and gentlemen at <placeName>Roussillon</placeName>.
 Whither, retaining her now wonted pilgrim's weeds, she hied her,
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090057"/>and finding that the ladies and gentlemen were all gathered in the
 Count's palace and on the point of going to table, she tarried not to
 change her dress, but went up into the hall, bearing her little ones in
 her arms, and threading her way through the through to the place
 where she saw the Count stand, she threw herself at his feet, and
 sobbing, said to him: 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090058"/><q>My lord, thy hapless bride am I, who to
 ensure thy homecoming and abidance in peace have long time been
 a wanderer, and now demand of thee observance of the condition
 whereof word was brought me by the two knights whom I sent to
 thee. Lo in my arms not one son only but twain, gotten of thee,
 and on my finger thy ring. 'Tis time, then, that I be received of
 thee as thy wife according to thy word.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090059"/>Whereat the Count was
 all dumfounded, recognizing the ring and his own lineaments in the
 children, so like were they to him; but saying to himself nevertheless:
 <q>How can it have come about?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090060"/>So the Countess, while the
 Count and all that were present marvelled exceedingly, told what
 <pb n="249"/>had happened, and the manner of it, in precise detail. Wherefore
 the Count, perceiving that she spoke truth, and having regard to her
 perseverance and address and her two fine boys, and the wishes of
 all his vassals and the ladies, who with one accord besought him to
 own and honour her thenceforth as his lawful bride, laid aside his
 harsh obduracy, and raised the Countess to her feet, and embraced
 and kissed her, and acknowledged her for his lawful wife, and the
 children for his own. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03090061"/>Then, having caused her to be rearrayed in
 garments befitting her rank, he, to the boundless delight of as many
 as were there, and of all other his vassals, gave up that day and some
 that followed to feasting and merrymaking; and did ever thenceforth
 honour, love and most tenderly cherish her as his bride and wife.</p></div><pb n="250"/><!--***********************************Novella 10*********************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0310"><head>Novel X</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03100001"/><!--(i)--><persName>Alibech</persName> turns hermit, and is taught by Rustico, a monk,

 my story--I say that in the city of <placeName>Capsa</placeName><note>Now Gafsa, in <placeName>Tunis</placeName>.</note>
 in Barbary there was once
 a very rich man, who with other children had a fair and dainty little
 daughter, <persName>Alibech</persName> by name. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03100005"/>Now <persName>Alibech</persName>, not being a Christian,
 and hearing many Christians, that were in the city, speak much in
 praise of the Christian Faith and the service of God, did one day
 inquire of one of them after what fashion it were possible to serve
 God with as few impediments as might be, and was informed that
 they served God best who most completely renounced the world and
 its affairs, like those who had fixed their abode in the wilds of the
 <placeName>Thebaid</placeName> desert. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03100006"/>Whereupon, actuated by no sober predilection, but
 <pb n="251"/>by childish impulse, the girl, who was very simple and about fourteen
 years of age, said never a word more of the matter, but stole away
 on the morrow, and quite alone set out to walk to the <placeName>Thebaid</placeName>
 desert; and, by force of resolution, albeit with no small suffering, she
 after some days reached those wilds; where, espying a cabin a great
 way off, she hied her thither, and found a holy man by the door,
 who, marvelling to see her there, asked her what she came there to
 seek. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03100007"/>She answered that, guided by the spirit of God, she was come
 thither, seeking, if haply she might serve Him, and also find some one
 that might teach her how He ought to be served. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03100008"/>Marking her
 youth and great beauty, the worthy man, fearing lest, if he suffered
 her to remain with him, he should be ensnared by the Devil, commended
 her good intention, set before her a frugal repast of roots of
 herbs, crab-apples and dates, with a little water to wash them down,
 and said to her: <q>My daughter, there is a holy man not far from
 here, who is much better able to teach thee that of which thou art in
 quest than I am; go to him, therefore;</q> and he shewed her the
 way. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03100009"/>But when she was come whither she was directed, she met
 with the same answer as before, and so, setting forth again, she came
 at length to the cell of a young hermit, a worthy man and very
 devout--his name Rustico--whom she interrogated as she had the
 others. Rustico, being minded to make severe trial of his constancy,
 did not send her away, as the others had done, but kept her with
 him in his cell, and when night came, made her a little bed of palmleaves;
 whereon he bade her compose herself to sleep. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03100010"/>Hardly had
 she done so before the solicitations of the flesh joined battle with the
 powers of Rustico's spirit, and he, finding himself left in the lurch
 by the latter, endured not many assaults before he beat a retreat, and
 surrendered at discretion: wherefore he bade adieu to holy meditation
 and prayer and discipline, and fell a musing on the youth and beauty
 of his companion, and also how he might so order his conversation
 with her, that without seeming to her to be a libertine he might yet
 compass that which he craved of her. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03100011"/>So, probing her by certain
 questions, he discovered that she was as yet entirely without cognizance
 of man, and as simple as she seemed: wherefore he excogitated
 a plan for bringing her to pleasure him under colour of serving God.
 He began by giving her a long lecture on the great enmity that
 subsists between God and the Devil; after which he gave her to
 <pb n="252"/>understand that, God having condemned the Devil to hell, to put
 him there was of all services the most acceptable to God. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03100012"/>The girl
 asking him how it might be done, Rustico answered: <q>Thou
 shalt know it in a trice; thou hast but to do that which thou seest me
 do.</q> Then, having divested himself of his scanty clothing, he threw
 himself stark naked on his knees, as if he would pray; whereby he
 caused the girl, who followed his example, to confront him in the
 same posture.<note>No apology is needed for leaving, in accordance

 disidéro acceso per lo vederla così bella, venne la
 resurrezion della
 carne, la quale riguardando <persName>Alibech</persName> e maravigliatasi, disse:
 <q>Rustico, quella che cosa è, che io ti veggio, che così si
 pigne in
 fuori, e non l' ho io?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03100014"/><q>O figliuola mia,</q> disse Rustico, <q>questo

 che non stai tu, chè io non ho cotesto Diavolo io.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03100016"/>Disse Rustico:
 <q>Tu di' vero, ma tu hai un' altra cosa che non la ho io, et

 Rustico disse: <q>Hai il ninferno; e dicoti che io mi credo che
 Iddio t' abbia qui mandata per la salute della anima mia, per ciò
 che se questo Diavolo pur mi darà questa noja, ove tu vogli aver di
 me tanta pietà, e sofferire che io in inferno il rimetta, tu mi darai
 grandissima consolazione, et a Dio farai grandissimo piacere e
 servigio, se tu per quello fare in queste parti venuta se', che tu di'.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03100019"/>La giovane di buona fede rispose: <q>O padre mio, poscia che ho
 il ninferno, sia pure quando vi piacerà.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03100020"/>Disse allora Rustico:
 <q>Figliuola mia, benedetta sia tu; andiamo dunque, e rimettiámlovi
 sì che egli poscia mi lasci stare.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03100021"/>E così detto, menata la
 giovane sopra uno de' loro letticelli, le 'nsegnò come star si dovesse a
 dovere
 incarcerare quel maledetto da Dio. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03100022"/>La giovane, che mai più non
 aveva in inferno messo diavolo alcuno, per la prima volta sentì un
 poco di noja, per che ella disse a Rustico: <q>Per certo, padre mio,
 mala cosa dee essere questo Diavolo, e veramente nimico di Dio, chè
 ancora al ninferno, non che altrui, duole quando egli v' è dentro
 rimesso.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03100023"/>Disse Rustico: <q>Figliuola, egli non avverrà sempre
 così.</q><pb n="253"/><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03100024"/>E per fare che questo non avvenisse, da sei volte, anzi che di su il
 letticel si movessero, ve 'l rimisero, tanto che per quella volta gli
 trasser sì la superbia del capo, che egli si stette volentieri in
 pace. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03100025"/>Ma, ritornatagli poi nel seguente tempo più volte, e la giovane
 ubbidiente
 sempre a trargliele si disponesse, avvenne che il giuoco le cominciò
 a piacere, e cominciò a dire a Rustico: <q>Ben veggio che il ver
 dicevano que' valentuomini in <placeName>Capsa</placeName>, che il servire a Dio era così
 dolce cosa: e per certo io non mi ricordo che mai alcuna altra ne
 facessi, che di tanto diletto e piacer mi fosse, quanto è il
 rimettere il
 Diavolo in inferno; e per ciò io giudico ogn' altra persona, che ad
 altro che a servire a Dio attende, essere una bestia.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03100026"/>Per la qual
 cosa essa spesse volte andava a Rustico, e gli dicea: <q>Padre mio,
 io son qui venuta per servire a Dio e non per istare oziosa; andiamo
 a rimettere il Diavolo in inferno.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03100027"/>La qual cosa faccendo, diceva
 ella alcuna volta: <q>Rustico, io non so perchè il Diavolo si fugga
 di
 ninferno; chè s' egli vi stesse così volentieri come il
 ninferno il
 riceve e tiene, egli non se ne uscirebbe mai.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03100028"/>Così adunque
 invitando
 spesso la giovane Rustico, et al servigio di Dio confortandolo sì la
 bambagia del farsetto tratta gli avea, che egli a tal ora sentiva freddo
 che un altro sarebbe sudato; e per ciò egli incominciò a dire
 alla
 giovane che il Diavolo non era da gastigare nè da rimettere in
 inferno,
 se non quando egli per superbia levasse il capo; e <q>noi per grazia di
 Dio l'abbiamo sì sgannato, che egli priega Iddio di starsi in
 pace</q>: e
 così alquanto impose di silenzio alla giovane. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03100029"/>La qual, poi che vide
 Rustico non la richiedeva a dovere il Diavolo rimettere in inferno,
 gli disse un giorno: <q>Rustico, se il Diavolo tuo è gastigato e
 più non ti dà noja, me il mio ninferno non lascia stare: per
 che
 tu farai bene che tu col tuo Diavolo ajuti attutare la rabbia al
 mio ninferno, com' io col mio ninferno ho ajutato a trarre la
 superbia al tuo Diavolo.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03100030"/>Rustico, che di radici d' erba e d' acqua
 vivea, poteva male rispondere alle poste; e dissele che troppi diavoli
 vorrebbono essere a potere il ninferno attutare, ma che egli ne
 farebbe ciò che per lui si potesse; c così alcuna volta le
 sodisfaceva,
 ma sì era di rado che altro non era che gittare una fava in bocca al
 leone: di che la giovane, non parendole tanto servire a Dio quanto
 voleva, mormorava anzi che no. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03100031"/>However, the case standing thus
 (deficiency of power against superfluity of desire) between Rustico's
 Devil and <persName>Alibech</persName>'s hell, it chanced that a fire broke out in <placeName>Capsa</placeName>,
 <pb n="254"/>whereby the house of <persName>Alibech</persName>'s father was burned, and he and all
 his sons and the rest of his household perished; so that <persName>Alibech</persName> was
 left sole heiress of all his estate. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03100032"/>And a young gallant, <persName>Neerbale</persName> by
 name, who by reckless munificence had wasted all his substance,
 having discovered that she was alive, addressed himself to the pursuit
 of her, and, having found her in time to prevent the confiscation of
 her father's estate as an escheat for failure of heirs, took her, much to
 Rustico's relief and against her own will, back to <placeName>Capsa</placeName>, and made
 her his wife, and shared with her her vast patrimony. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03100033"/>But before
 he had lain with her, she was questioned by the ladies of the manner
 in which she had served God in the desert; whereto she answered,
 that she had been wont to serve Him by putting the Devil in hell,
 and that <persName>Neerbale</persName> had committed a great sin, when he took her out
 of such service. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03100034"/>The ladies being curious to know how the Devil
 was put in hell, the girl satisfied them, partly by words, partly by

 it came at last to be a common proverb, that the most acceptable
 service that can be rendered to God is to put the Devil in hell;
 which proverb, having travelled hither across the sea, is still current.
 Wherefore, young ladies, you that have need of the grace of God,
 see to it that you learn how to put the Devil in hell, because 'tis
 mightily pleasing to God, and of great solace to both the parties,
 and much good may thereby be engendered and ensue.</p></div><!--***********************************Conclusion*********************************--><div type="conclusion" corresp="d03conclu"><head>Conclusion</head><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03970001"/>A thousand times or more had <persName>Dioneo</persName>'s story brought the laugh to

 all matters as he deemed would be best and most to the satisfaction of
 the company, while his sovereignty should last; and having so done,
 he turned to the ladies, and said:

 I knew how, to all his ways, my fate has been still the same, to be
 discarded for another, and go ever from bad to worse; and so, I
 suppose, 'twill be with me to the hour of my death. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p03970006"/>Wherefore I am

 wise, as from matters that not seldom fell within my own observation
 and reading, I formed the opinion that the vehement and
 scorching blast of envy was apt to vent itself only upon lofty towers
      or the highest tree-tops: but therein I find that I misjudged; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04980003"/>for,
 whereas I ever sought and studied how best to elude the buffetings
 of that furious hurricane, and to that end kept a course not merely
 on the plain, but, by preference, in the depth of the valley; as
 should be abundantly clear to whoso looks at these little stories,
 written as they are not only in the vulgar Florentine, and in prose,
 and without dedicatory flourish, but also in as homely and simple a
 style as may be; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04980004"/>nevertheless all this has not stood me in such stead
 but that I have been shrewdly shaken, nay, all but uprooted by the
 blast, and altogether lacerated by the bite of this same envy.
 Whereby I may very well understand that 'tis true, what the sages
 aver, that only misery is exempt from envy in the present life.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04980005"/>Know then, discreet my ladies, that some there are, who, reading
 these little stories, have alleged that I am too fond of you, and that
 'tis not a seemly thing that I should take so much pleasure in
 ministering to your gratification and solace; and some have found
 more fault with me for praising you as I do. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04980006"/>Others, affecting to
 deliver a more considered judgment, have said that it ill befits my
 time of life to ensue such matters, to wit, the discoursing of women,
 or endeavouring to pleasure them. And not a few, feigning a mighty
 tender regard to my fame, aver that I should do more wisely to keep
 <pb n="259"/>ever with the Muses on Parnassus, than to forgather with you in such
 vain dalliance. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04980007"/>Those again there are, who, evincing less wisdom
 than despite, have told me that I should shew sounder sense if I
 bethought me how to get my daily bread, than, going after these idle
 toys, to nourish myself upon the wind; while certain others, in
 disparagement of my work, strive might and main to make it appear
 that the matters which I relate fell out otherwise than as I set them
 forth. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04980008"/>Such then, noble ladies, are the blasts, such the sharp and
 cruel fangs, by which, while I champion your cause, I am assailed,
 harassed and well-nigh pierced through and through. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04980009"/>Which
 censures I hear and mark, God knows, with equal mind: and,
 though to you belongs all my defence, yet I mean not to be niggard
 of my own powers, but rather, without dealing out to them the
 castigation they deserve, to give them such slight answer as may
 secure my ears some respite of their clamour; and that without
 delay; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04980010"/>seeing that, if already, though I have not completed the
 third part of my work, they are not a few and very presumptuous, I
 deem it possible, that before I have reached the end, should they
 receive no check, they may have grown so numerous, that 'twould
 scarce tax their powers to sink me; and that your forces, great though
 they be, would not suffice to withstand them. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04980011"/>However I am
 minded to answer none of them, until I have related in my behoof,
 not indeed an entire story, for I would not seem to foist my stories in
 among those of so honourable a company as that with which I have
 made you acquainted, but a part of one, that its very incompleteness
 may shew that it is not one of them: wherefore, addressing my
 assailants, I say: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04980012"/>That in our city there was in old time a citizen
 named <persName>Filippo</persName> Balducci, a man of quite low origin, but of good
 substance and well versed and expert in matters belonging to his
 condition, who had a wife that he most dearly loved, as did she him,
 so that their life passed in peace and concord, nor there was aught
 they studied so much as how to please each other perfectly. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04980013"/>Now it
 came to pass, as it does to every one, that the good lady departed this
 life, leaving <persName>Filippo</persName> nought of hers but an only son, that she had had
 by him, and who was then about two years old. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04980014"/>His wife's death left
 <persName>Filippo</persName> as disconsolate as ever was any man for the loss of a loved
 one: and sorely missing the companionship that was most dear to
 him, he resolved to have done with the world, and devote himself
 <pb n="260"/>and his little son to the service of God. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04980015"/>Wherefore, having dedicated
 all his goods to charitable uses, he forthwith betook him to the summit
 of <placeName>Monte Asinaio</placeName>, where he installed himself with his son in a little
 cell, and living on alms, passed his days in fasting and prayer, being
 careful above all things to say nothing to the boy of any temporal
 matters, nor to let him see aught of the kind, lest they should
 distract his mind from his religious exercises, but discoursing with
 him continually of the glory of the life eternal and of God and the
 saints, and teaching him nought else but holy orisons: in which way
 of life he kept him not a few years, never suffering him to quit the
 cell or see aught but himself. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04980016"/>From time to time the worthy man
 would go <placeName>Florence</placeName>, where divers of the faithful would afford him
 relief according to his needs, and so he would return to his cell.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04980017"/>And thus it fell out that one day <persName>Filippo</persName>, now an aged man, being
 asked by the boy, who was about eighteen years old, whither he went,
 told him. Whereupon: <q>Father,</q> said the boy, <q>you are now old,
 and scarce able to support fatigue; why take you me not with you
 for once to <placeName>Florence</placeName>, and give me to know devout friends of God
 and you, so that I, who am young and fitter for such exertion than
 you, may thereafter go to <placeName>Florence</placeName> for our supplies at your pleasure,
 and you remain here?</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04980018"/>The worthy man, bethinking him that his son was now grown
 up, and so habituated to the service of God as hardly to be seduced
 by the things of the world, said to himself: <q>He says tell.</q> And
 so, as he must needs go to <placeName>Florence</placeName>, he took the boy with him.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04980019"/>Where, seeing the palaces, the houses, the churches, and all matters
 else with which the city abounds, and of which he had no more
 recollection than if he had never seen them, the boy found all passing
 strange, and questioned his father of not a few of them, what they
 were and how they were named; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04980020"/>his curiosity being no sooner
 satisfied in one particular than he plied his father with a further
 question. And so it befell that, while son and father were thus
 occupied in asking and answering questions, they encountered a bevy
 of damsels, fair and richly arrayed, being on their return from a
 wedding; whom the young man no sooner saw, than he asked his
 father what they might be. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04980021"/><q>My son,</q> answered the father, <q>fix
 thy gaze on the ground, regard them not at all, for naughty things
 are they.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04980022"/><q>Oh!</q> said the son, <q>and what is their name?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04980023"/>The
 <pb n="261"/>father, fearing to awaken some mischievous craving of concupiscence
 in the young man, would not denote them truly, to wit, as women,
 but said: <q>They are called goslings.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04980024"/>Whereupon, wonderful
 to tell! the lad who had never before set eyes on any woman,
 thought no more of the palaces, the oxen, the horses, the asses,
 the money, or aught else that he had seen, but exclaimed:
 <q>Prithee, father, let me have one of those goslings.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04980025"/><q>Alas,
 my son,</q> replied the father, <q>speak not of them; they are
 naughty things.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04980026"/><q>Oh!</q> questioned the son; <q>but are naughty
 things made like that?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04980027"/><q>Ay,</q> returned the father. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04980028"/>Whereupon
 the son: <q>I know not,</q> he said, <q>what you say, nor why they
 should be naughty things: for my part I have as yet seen nought
 that seemed to me so fair and delectable. They are fairer than the
 painted angels that you have so often shewn me. Oh! if you love
 me, do but let us take one of these goslings up there, and I will see
 that she have whereon to bill.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04980029"/><q>Nay,</q> said the father, <q>that will
 not I. Thou knowest not whereon they bill;</q> and straightway,
 being ware that nature was more potent than his art, he repented
 him that he had brought the boy to <placeName>Florence</placeName>.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04980030"/>But enough of this story: 'tis time for me to cut it short, and
 return to those, for whose instruction 'tis told. They say then,
 some of these my censors, that I am too fond of you, young ladies,
 and am at too great pains to pleasure you. Now that I am fond of
 you, and am at pains to pleasure you, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04980031"/>I do most frankly and fully
 confess; and I ask them whether, considering only all that it means
 to have had, and to have continually, before one's eyes your debonair
 demeanour, your bewitching beauty and exquisite grace, and therewithal
 your modest womanliness, not to speak of having known the
 amorous kisses, the caressing embraces, the voluptuous comminglings,
 whereof our intercourse with you, ladies most sweet, not seldom is
 productive, they do verily marvel that I am fond of you, seeing that
 one who was nurtured, reared, and brought up on a savage and solitary
 mountain, within the narrow circuit of a cell, without other companion
 than his father, had no sooner seen you than 'twas you alone
 that he desired, that he demanded, that he sought with ardour?
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04980032"/>Will they tear, will they lacerate me with their censures, if I,
 whose body Heaven fashioned all apt for love, whose soul from
 very boyhood was dedicate to you, am not insensible to the power
 <pb n="262"/>of the light of your eyes, to the sweetness of your honeyed words,
 to the flame that is kindled by your gentle sighs, but am fond of you
 and sedulous to pleasure you; you, again I bid them remember,
 in whom a hermit, a rude, witless lad, liker to an animal than to a
 human being, found more to delight him than in aught else that he
 saw? Of a truth whoso taxes me thus must be one that, feeling,
 knowing nought of the pleasure and power of natural affection, loves
 you not, nor craves your love; and such an one I hold in light esteem.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04980033"/>And as for those that go about to find ground of exception in my
 age, they do but shew that they ill understand that the leek, albeit
 its head is white, has a green tail. But jesting apart, thus I answer
 them, that never to the end of my life shall I deem it shameful to
 me to pleasure those to whom Guido Cavalcanti and Dante Alighieri
 in their old age, and Messer Cino da <placeName>Pistoia</placeName> in extreme old age,
 accounted it an honour and found it a delight to minister gratification.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04980034"/>And but that 'twere a deviation from the use and wont of
 discourse, I would call history to my aid, and shew it to abound
 with stories of noble men of old time, who in their ripest age studied
 above all things else to pleasure the ladies; whereof if they be
 ignorant, go they and get them to school. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04980035"/>To keep with the Muses
 on Parnassus is counsel I approve; but tarry with them always we
 cannot, nor they with us, nor is a man blameworthy, if, when he
 happen to part from them, he find his delight in those that resemble
 them. The Muses are ladies, and albeit ladies are not the peers of
 the Muses, yet they have their outward semblance; for which cause,
 if for no other, 'tis reasonable that I should be fond of them.
 Besides which, ladies have been to me the occasion of composing
 some thousand verses, but of never a verse that I made were the
 Muses the occasion. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04980036"/>Howbeit 'twas with their aid, 'twas under their
 influence that I composed those thousand verses, and perchance they
 have sometimes visited me to encourage me in my present task, humble
 indeed though it be, doing honour and paying, as it were, tribute,
 to the likeness which the ladies have to them; wherefore, while I
 weave these stories, I stray not so far from Mount Parnassus and the
 Muses as not a few perchance suppose. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04980037"/>But what shall we say to
 those, in whom my hunger excites such commiseration that they
 bid me get me bread? Verily I know not, save this: Suppose that
 in my need I were to beg bread of them, what would be their
 <pb n="263"/>answer? I doubt not they would say: <q>Go seek it among the
 fables.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04980038"/>And in sooth the poets have found more bread among their
 fables than many rich men among their treasures. And many that
 have gone after fables have crowned their days with splendour, while,
 on the other hand, not a few, in the endeavour to get them more
 bread than they needed, have perished miserably. But why waste
 more words on them? Let them send me packing, when I ask
 bread of them; not that, thank God, I have yet need of it, and
 should I ever come to be in need of it, I know, like the Apostle,
 how to abound and to be in want, and so am minded to be beholden
 to none but myself. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04980039"/>As for those who say that these matters fell out
 otherwise than as I relate them, I should account it no small favour,
 if they would produce the originals, and should what I write not
 accord with them, I would acknowledge the justice of their censure,
 and study to amend my ways; but, until better evidence is forthcoming
 than their words, I shall adhere to my own opinion without
 seeking to deprive them of theirs, and give them tit for tat. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04980040"/>And
 being minded that for this while this answer suffice, I say that with
 God and you, in whom I trust, most gentle ladies, to aid and protect
 me, and patience for my stay, I shall go forward with my work,
 turning my back on this tempest, however it may rage; for I see
 not that I can fare worse than the fine dust, which the blast of the
 whirlwind either leaves where it lies, or bears aloft, not seldom over
 the heads of men, over the crowns of kings, of emperors, and sometimes
 suffers to settle on the roofs of lofty palaces, and the summits
 of the tallest towers, whence if it fall, it cannot sink lower than the
 level from which it was raised. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04980041"/>And if I ever devoted myself and
 all my powers to minister in any wise to your gratification, I am
 now minded more than ever so to do, because I know that there is
 nought that any can justly say in regard thereof, but that I, and
 others who love you, follow the promptings of nature, whose laws
 whoso would withstand, has need of powers pre-eminent, and, even
 so, will oft-times labour not merely in vain but to his own most
 grievous disadvantage. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04980042"/>Such powers I own that I neither have, nor,
 to such end, desire to have; and had I them, I would rather leave
 them to another than use them myself. Wherefore let my detractors
 hold their peace, and if they cannot get heat, why, let them shiver
 their life away; and, while they remain addicted to their delights,
 <pb n="264"/>or rather corrupt tastes, let them leave me to follow my own bent
 during the brief life that is accorded us. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04980043"/>But this has been a long
 digression, fair ladies, and 'tis time to retrace our steps to the point
 where we deviated, and continue in the course on which we started.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04980044"/>The sun had chased every star from the sky, and lifted the dank
 murk of night from the earth, when, <persName>Filostrato</persName> being risen, and
 having roused all his company, they hied them to the fair garden,
 and there fell to disporting themselves: the time for breakfast being
 come, they took it where they had supped on the preceding evening,
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04980045"/>and after they had slept they rose, when the sun was in his zenith,
 and seated themselves in their wonted manner by the beautiful
 fountain; where <persName>Fiammetta</persName>, being bidden by <persName>Filostrato</persName> to lead off
 the story-telling, awaited no second command, but debonairly thus
 began.</p></div><pb n="265"/><!--*********************Novella 1******************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0401"><head>Novel I</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010001"/><!--(i)-->Tancred, Prince of <placeName>Salerno</placeName>, slays his daughter's lover,

 befell piteously, nay woefully, and so as you may well weep thereat.</p></body></floatingText><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010003"/>Tancred, Prince of <placeName>Salerno</placeName>, a lord most humane and kind of heart,
 but that in his old age he imbrued his hands in the blood of a lover,
 had in the whole course of his life but one daughter; and had he not
 had her, he had been more fortunate.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010004"/>Never was daughter more tenderly beloved of father than she of
 the Prince, who, for that cause not knowing how to part with her,
 kept her unmarried for many a year after she had come of marriageable
 age: then at last he gave her to a son of the Duke of <placeName>Capua</placeName>,
 with whom she had lived but a short while, when he died and she
      returned to her father. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010005"/>Most lovely was she of form and feature
 (never woman more so), and young and light of heart, and more
 knowing, perchance, than beseemed a woman. Dwelling thus with
 her loving father, as a great lady, in no small luxury, nor failing to
 see that the Prince, for the great love he bore her, was at no pains to
 provide her with another husband, and deeming it unseemly on her
 <pb n="266"/>part to ask one of him, she cast about how she might come by a
 gallant to be her secret lover. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010006"/>And seeing at her father's court not
 a few men, both gentle and simple, that resorted thither, as we know
 men use to frequent courts, and closely scanning their mien and
 manners, she preferred before all others the Prince's page, <persName>Guiscardo</persName>
 by name, a man of very humble origin, but pre-eminent for native
 worth and noble bearing; of whom, seeing him frequently, she
 became hotly enamoured, hourly extolling his qualities more and
 more highly. The young man, who for all his youth by no means
 lacked shrewdness, read her heart, and gave her his own on such
 wise that his love for her engrossed his mind to the exclusion of
 almost everything else. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010007"/>While thus they burned in secret for one
 another, the lady, desiring of all things a meeting with <persName>Guiscardo</persName>,
 but being shy of making any her confidant, hit upon a novel
 expedient to concert the affair with him. She wrote him a letter
 containing her commands for the ensuing day, and thrust it into a
 cane in the space between two of the knots, which cane she gave to
 <persName>Guiscardo</persName>, saying: <q>Thou canst let thy servant have it for a
 bellows to blow thy fire up to night.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010008"/><persName>Guiscardo</persName> took it, and
 feeling sure that 'twas not unadvisedly that she made him such a
 present, accompanied with such words, hied him straight home,
 where, carefully examining the cane, he observed that it was cleft,
 and, opening it, found the letter; which he had no sooner read, and
 learned what he was to do, than, pleased as ne'er another, he fell to
 devising how to set all in order that he might not fail to meet the
 lady on the following day, after the manner she had prescribed.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010009"/>Now hard by the Prince's palace was a grotto, hewn in days of
 old in the solid rock, and now long disused, so that an artificial
 orifice, by which it received a little light, was all but choked with
 brambles and plants that grew about and overspread it. From one
 of the ground-floor rooms of the palace, which room was part of the
 lady's suite, a secret stair led to the grotto, though the entrance was
 barred by a very strong door. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010010"/>This stair, having been from time
 immemorial disused, had passed out of mind so completely that there
 was scarce any that remembered that it was there: but Love, whose
 eyes nothing, however secret, may escape, had brought it to the mind
 of the enamoured lady. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010011"/>For many a day, using all secrecy, that
 none should discover her, she had wrought with her tools, until she had
 <pb n="267"/>succeeded in opening the door; which done, she had gone down
 into the grotto alone, and having observed the orifice, had by her
 letter apprised <persName>Guiscardo</persName> of its apparent height above the floor of
 the grotto, and bidden him contrive some means of descending
 thereby. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010012"/>Eager to carry the affair through, <persName>Guiscardo</persName> lost no time
 in rigging up a ladder of ropes, whereby he might ascend and
 descend; and having put on a suit of leather to protect him from
 the brambles, he hied him the following night (keeping the affair
 close from all) to the orifice, made the ladder fast by one of its ends
 to a massive trunk that was rooted in the mouth of the orifice,
 climbed down the ladder, and awaited the lady. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010013"/>On the morrow,
 making as if she would fain sleep, the lady dismissed her damsels,
 and locked herself into her room: she then opened the door of the
 grotto, hied her down, and met <persName>Guiscardo</persName>, to their marvellous
 mutual satisfaction. The lovers then repaired to her room, where
 in exceeding great joyance they spent no small part of the day. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010014"/>Nor
 were they neglectful of the precautions needful to prevent discovery
 of their amour; but in due time <persName>Guiscardo</persName> returned to the grotto;
 whereupon the lady locked the door and rejoined her damsels. At
 nightfall <persName>Guiscardo</persName> reascended his ladder, and, issuing forth of the
 orifice, hied him home; nor, knowing now the way, did he fail to
 revisit the grotto many a time thereafter.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010015"/>But Fortune, noting with envious eye a happiness of such degree
 and duration, gave to events a dolorous turn, whereby the joy of the
 two lovers was converted into bitter lamentation. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010016"/>'Twas Tancred's
 custom to come from time to time quite alone to his daughter's
 room, and tarry talking with her a while. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010017"/>Whereby it so befell that
 he came down there one day after breakfast, while Ghismonda--such
 was the lady's name--was in her garden with her damsels; so that
 none saw or heard him enter; nor would he call his daughter, for he
 was minded that she should not forgo her pleasure. But, finding the
 windows closed and the bed-curtains drawn down, he seated himself
 on a divan that stood at one of the corners of the bed, rested his head
 on the bed, drew the curtain over him, and thus, hidden as if of set
 purpose, fell asleep. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010018"/>As he slept Ghismonda, who, as it happened,
 had caused <persName>Guiscardo</persName> to come that day, left her damsels in the garden,
 softly entered the room, and having locked herself in, unwitting
 that there was another in the room, opened the door to <persName>Guiscardo</persName>,
 <pb n="268"/>who was in waiting. Straightway they got them to bed, as was
 their wont; and, while they there solaced and disported them
 together, it so befell that Tancred awoke, and heard and saw what
 they did: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010019"/>whereat he was troubled beyond measure, and at first was
 minded to upbraid them; but on second thoughts he deemed it best
 to hold his peace, and avoid discovery, if so he might with greater
 stealth and less dishonour carry out the design which was already in
 his mind. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010020"/>The two lovers continued long together, as they were
 wont, all unwitting of Tancred; but at length they saw fit to get
 out of bed, when <persName>Guiscardo</persName> went back to the grotto, and the lady
 hied her forth of the room. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010021"/>Whereupon Tancred, old though he
 was, got out at one of the windows, clambered down into the garden,
 and, seen by none, returned sorely troubled to his room. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010022"/>By his
 command two men took <persName>Guiscardo</persName> early that same night, as he
 issued forth of the orifice accoutred in his suit of leather, and brought
 him privily to Tancred; who, as he saw him, all but wept, and
 said: <q><persName>Guiscardo</persName>, my kindness to thee is ill requited by the outrage
 and dishonour which thou hast done me in the person of my daughter,
 as to-day I have seen with my own eyes.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010023"/>To whom <persName>Guiscardo</persName>
 could answer nought but: <q>Love is more potent than either you
 or I.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010024"/>Tancred then gave order to keep him privily under watch
 and ward in a room within the palace; and so 'twas done. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010025"/>Next
 day, while Ghismonda wotted nought of these matters, Tancred,
 after pondering divers novel expedients, hied him after breakfast,
 according to his wont, to his daughter's room, where, having called
 her to him and locked himself in with her, he began, not without
 tears, to speak on this wise: 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010026"/><q>Ghismonda, conceiving that I knew
 thy virtue and honour, never, though it had been reported to me,
 would I have credited, had I not seen with my own eyes, that thou
 wouldst so much as in idea, not to say fact, have ever yielded thyself
 to any man but thy husband: wherefore, for the brief residue of life
 that my age has in store for me, the memory of thy fall will ever be
 grievous to me. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010027"/>And would to God, as thou must needs demean
 thyself to such dishonour, thou hadst taken a man that matched thy
 nobility; but of all the men that frequent my court, thou must needs
 choose <persName>Guiscardo</persName>, a young man of the lowest condition, a fellow
 whom we brought up in charity from his tender years; for whose
 sake thou hast plunged me into the abyss of mental tribulation,
 <pb n="269"/>insomuch that I know not what course to take in regard of thee.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010028"/>As to <persName>Guiscardo</persName>, whom I caused to be arrested last night as he
 issued from the orifice, and keep in durance, my course is already
 taken, but how I am to deal with thee, God knows, I know not. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010029"/>I
 am distraught between the love which I have ever borne thee, love
 such as no father ever bare to daughter, and the most just indignation
 evoked in me by thy signal folly; my love prompts me to pardon
 thee, my indignation bids me harden my heart against thee, though
 I do violence to my nature. But before I decide upon my course,
 I would fain hear what thou hast to say to this.</q> So saying, he
 bent his head, and wept as bitterly as any child that had been
 soundly thrashed.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010030"/>Her father's words, and the tidings they conveyed that not only
 was her secret passion discovered, but <persName>Guiscardo</persName> taken, caused
 Ghismonda immeasurable grief, which she was again and again on
 the point of evincing, as most women do, by cries and tears; but
 her high spirit triumphed over this weakness; by a prodigious effort
 she composed her countenance, and taking it for granted that her
 <persName>Guiscardo</persName> was no more, she inly devoted herself to death rather than
 a single prayer for herself should escape her lips. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010031"/>Wherefore, not as
 a woman stricken with grief or chidden for a fault, but unconcerned
 and unabashed, with tearless eyes, and frank and utterly dauntless
 mien, thus answered she her father: <q>Tancred, your accusation
 I shall not deny, neither will I cry you mercy, for nought should
 I gain by denial, nor aught would I gain by supplication: nay more;
 there is nought I will do to conciliate thy humanity and love; my
 only care is to confess the truth, to defend my honour by words of
 sound reason, and then by deeds most resolute to give effect to the
 promptings of my high soul. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010032"/>True it is that I have loved and love
 <persName>Guiscardo</persName>, and during the brief while I have yet to live shall love
 him, nor after death, so there be then love, shall I cease to love him;
 but that I love him, is not imputable to my womanly frailty so
 much as to the little zeal thou shewedst for my bestowal in marriage,
 and to <persName>Guiscardo</persName>'s own worth. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010033"/>It should not have escaped thee,
 Tancred, creature of flesh and blood as thou art, that thy daughter
 was also a creature of flesh and blood, and not of stone or iron; it
 was, and is, thy duty to bear in mind (old though thou art) the
 nature and the might of the laws to which youth is subject; and,
 <pb n="270"/>though thou hast spent part of thy best years in martial exercises,
 thou shouldst nevertheless have not been ignorant how potent is the
 influence even upon the aged--to say nothing of the young--of ease
 and luxury. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010034"/>And not only am I, as being thy daughter, a creature
 of flesh and blood, but my life is not so far spent but that I am still
 young, and thus doubly fraught with fleshly appetite, the vehemence
 whereof is marvellously enhanced by reason that, having been married,
 I have known the pleasure that ensues upon the satisfaction of such
 desire. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010035"/>Which forces being powerless to withstand, I did but act
 as was natural in a young woman, when I gave way to them, and
 yielded myself to love. Nor in sooth did I fail to the utmost of my
 power so to order the indulgence of my natural propensity that my
 sin should bring shame neither upon thee nor upon me. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010036"/>To which
 end Love in his pity, and Fortune in a friendly mood, found and
 discovered to me a secret way, whereby, none witting, I attained my
 desire: this, from whomsoever thou hast learned it, howsoever thou
 comest to know it, I deny not. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010037"/>'Twas not at random, as many
 women do, that I loved <persName>Guiscardo</persName>; but by deliberate choice I preferred
 him before all other men, and of determinate forethought I
 lured him to my love, whereof, through his and my discretion and
 constancy, I have long had joyance. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010038"/>Wherein 'twould seem that
 thou, following rather the opinion of the vulgar than the dictates of
 truth, find cause to chide me more severely than in my sinful love,
 for, as if thou wouldst not have been vexed, had my choice fallen on
 a nobleman, thou complainest that I have forgathered with a man of
 low condition; and dost not see that therein thou censurest not my
 fault but that of Fortune, which not seldom raises the unworthy to
 high place and leaves the worthiest in low estate. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010039"/>But leave we
 this: consider a little the principles of things: thou seest that in
 regard of our flesh we are all moulded of the same substance, and
 that all souls are endowed by one and the same Creator with equal
 faculties, equal powers, equal virtues. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010040"/>'Twas merit that made the
 first distinction between us, born as we were, nay, as we are, all
 equal, and those whose merits were and were approved in act the
 greatest were called noble, and the rest were not so denoted. Which
 law, albeit overlaid by the contrary usage of after times, is not yet
 abrogated, nor so impaired but that it is still traceable in nature and
 good manners; for which cause whoso with merit acts, does plainly
 <pb n="271"/>shew himself a gentleman; and if any denote him otherwise, the
 default is his own and not his whom he so denotes. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010041"/>Pass in review
 all thy nobles, weigh their merits, their manners and bearing, and then
 compare <persName>Guiscardo</persName>'s qualities with theirs: if thou wilt judge without
 prejudice, thou wilt pronounce him noble in the highest degree, and
 thy nobles one and all churls. As to <persName>Guiscardo</persName>'s merits and worth I
 did but trust the verdict which thou thyself didst utter in words, and
 which mine own eyes confirmed. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010042"/>Of whom had he such commendation
 as of thee for all those excellences whereby a good man and true
 merits commendation? And in sooth thou didst him but justice;
 for, unless mine eyes have played me false, there was nought for
 which thou didst commend him but I had seen him practise it, and
 that more admirably than words of thine might express; and had I
 been at all deceived in this matter, 'twould have been by thee. Wilt
 thou say then that I have forgathered with a man of low condition?
 If so, thou wilt not say true. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010043"/>Didst thou say with a poor man, the
 impeachment might be allowed, to thy shame, that thou so ill hast
 known how to requite a good man and true that is thy servant; but
 poverty, though it take away all else, deprives no man of gentilesse.
 Many kings, many great princes, were once poor, and many a ditcher
 or herdsman has been and is very wealthy. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010044"/>As for thy last perpended
 doubt, to wit, how thou shouldst deal with me, banish it
 utterly from thy thoughts. If in thy extreme old age thou art
 minded to manifest a harshness unwonted in thy youth, wreak thy
 harshness on me, resolved as I am to cry thee no mercy, prime cause
 as I am that this sin, if sin it be, has been committed; for of this I
 warrant thee, that as thou mayst have done or shalt do to <persName>Guiscardo</persName>,
 if to me thou do not the like, I with my own hands will do it. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010045"/>Now
 get thee gone to shed thy tears with the women, and when thy
 melting mood is over, ruthlessly destroy <persName>Guiscardo</persName> and me, if such
 thou deem our merited doom, by one and the same blow.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010046"/>The loftiness of his daughter's spirit was not unknown to the
 Prince; but still he did not credit her with a resolve quite as firmly
 fixed as her words implied, to carry their purport into effect. So,
 parting from her without the least intention of using harshness
 towards her in her own person, he determined to quench the heat of
 her love by wreaking his vengeance on her lover, and bade the two
 men that had charge of <persName>Guiscardo</persName> to strangle him noiselessly that
 <pb n="272"/>same night, take the heart out of the body, and send it to him. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010047"/>The
 men did his bidding: and on the morrow the Prince had a large and
 beautiful cup of gold brought to him, and having put <persName>Guiscardo</persName>'s
 heart therein, sent it by the hand of one of his most trusted servants
 to his daughter, charging the servant to say, as he gave it to her:
 <q>Thy father sends thee this to give thee joy of that which thou
 lovest best, even as thou hast given him joy of that which he loved
 best.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010048"/>Now when her father had left her, Ghismonda, wavering not
 a jot in her stern resolve, had sent for poisonous herbs and roots, and
 therefrom had distilled a water, to have it ready for use, if that which
 she apprehended should come to pass. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010049"/>And when the servant
 appeared with the Prince's present and message, she took the cup
 unblenchingly, and having lifted the lid, and seen the heart, and
 apprehended the meaning of the words, and that the heart was
 beyond a doubt <persName>Guiscardo</persName>'s, she raised her head, and looking straight
 at the servant, said: <q>Sepulture less honourable than of gold had
 ill befitted heart such as this: herein has my father done wisely.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010050"/>Which said, she raised it to her lips, and kissed it, saying: <q>In all
 things and at all times, even to this last hour of my life, have I
 found my father most tender in his love, but now more so than
 ever before; wherefore I now render him the last thanks which will
 ever be due from me to him for this goodly present.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010051"/>So she spoke,
 and straining the cup to her, bowed her head over it, and gazing at
 the heart, said: <q>Ah! sojourn most sweet of all my joys, accursed
 be he by whose ruthless act I see thee with the bodily eye: 'twas
 enough that to the mind's eye thou wert hourly present. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010052"/>Thou
 hast run thy course; thou hast closed the span that Fortune allotted
 thee; thou hast reached the goal of all; thou hast left behind thee
 the woes and weariness of the world; and thy enemy has himself
 granted thee sepulture accordant with thy deserts. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010053"/>No circumstance
 was wanting to duly celebrate thy obsequies, save the tears of her
 whom, while thou livedst, thou didst so dearly love; which that
 thou shouldst not lack, my remorseless father was prompted of God
 to send thee to me, and, albeit my resolve was fixed to die with eyes
 unmoistened and front all unperturbed by fear, yet will I accord
 thee my tears; which done, my care shall be forthwith by thy
 means to join my soul to that most precious soul which thou didst
 <pb n="273"/>once enshrine. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010054"/>And is there other company than hers, in which
 with more of joy and peace I might fare to the abodes unknown?
 She is yet here within, I doubt not, contemplating the abodes of her
 and my delights, and--for sure I am that she loves me--awaiting my
 soul that loves her before all else.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010055"/>Having thus spoken, she bowed herself low over the cup; and,
 while no womanish cry escaped her, 'twas as if a fountain of water
 were unloosed within her head, so wondrous a flood of tears gushed
 from her eyes, while times without number she kissed the dead
 heart. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010056"/>Her damsels that stood around her knew not whose the
 heart might be or what her words might mean, but melting in sympathy,
 they all wept, and compassionately, as vainly, enquired the
 cause of her lamentation, and in many other ways sought to comfort
 her to the best of their understanding and power. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010057"/>When she had
 wept her fill, she raised her head, and dried her eyes. Then: <q>O
 heart,</q> said she, <q>much cherished heart, discharged is my every duty
 towards thee; nought now remains for me to do but to come and
 unite my soul with thine.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010058"/>So saying, she sent for the vase that
 held the water which the day before she had distilled, and emptied
 it into the cup where lay the heart bathed in her tears; then, nowise
 afraid, she set her mouth to the cup, and drained it dry, and so with
 the cup in her hand she got her upon her bed, and having there disposed
 her person in guise as seemly as she might, laid her dead lover's heart
 upon her own, and silently awaited death. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010059"/>Meanwhile the damsels,
 seeing and hearing what passed, but knowing not what the water
 was that she had drunk, had sent word of each particular to Tancred;
 who, apprehensive of that which came to pass, came down with all
 haste to his daughter's room, where he arrived just as she got her
 upon her bed, and, now too late, addressed himself to comfort her
 with soft words, and seeing in what plight she was, burst into a flood
 of bitter tears. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010060"/>To whom the lady: <q>Reserve thy tears, Tancred,
 till Fortune send thee hap less longed for than this: waste them not
 on me who care not for them. Whoever yet saw any but thee
 bewail the consummation of his desire? But, if of the love thou
 once didst bear me any spark still lives in thee, be it thy parting
 grace to me, that, as thou brookedst not that I should live with
 <persName>Guiscardo</persName> in privity and seclusion, so wherever thou mayst have
 caused <persName>Guiscardo</persName>'s body to be cast, mine may be united with it in the
 <pb n="274"/>common view of all.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010061"/>The Prince replied not for excess of grief;
 and the lady, feeling that her end was come, strained the dead heart
 to her bosom, saying: <q>Fare ye well; I take my leave of you;</q>
 and with eyelids drooped and every sense evanished departed this
 life of woe. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04010062"/>Such was the lamentable end of the loves of <persName>Guiscardo</persName>
 and Ghismonda; whom Tancred, tardily repentant of his harshness,
 mourned not a little, as did also all the folk of <placeName>Salerno</placeName>, and had
 honourably interred side by side in the same tomb.</p></div><pb n="275"/><!--************************Novella 2**************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0402"><head>Novel II</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020001"/><!--(i)-->Fra Alberto gives a lady to under stand that she is beloved

 whose story, rather than aught else, I am minded to tell you, if so
 I may, perchance, by laughter and jollity relieve in some degree your
 souls that are heavy laden with pity for the death of Ghismonda.</p></body></floatingText><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020008"/>Know then, noble ladies, that there was in <placeName>Imola</placeName> a man of evil
 and corrupt life, Berto della Massa by name, whose pestilent practices
 came at length to be so well known to the good folk of <placeName>Imola</placeName> that
 'twas all one whether he lied or spoke the truth, for there was not a
 soul in <placeName>Imola</placeName> that believed a word he said: wherefore, seeing that his
 tricks would pass no longer there, he removed, as in despair, to <placeName>Venice</placeName>,
 that common sink of all abominations, thinking there to find other
 means than he had found elsewhere to the prosecution of his nefarious
 designs. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020009"/>And, as if conscience-stricken for his past misdeeds, he
 assumed an air of the deepest humility, turned the best Catholic of
 them all, and went and made himself a friar minor, taking the name
 of Fra Alberto da <placeName>Imola</placeName>. With his habit he put on a shew of
 austerity, highly commending penitence and abstinence, and eating
 or drinking no sort of meat or wine but such as was to his taste.
 <pb n="277"/><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020010"/>And scarce a soul was there that wist that the thief, the pimp,
 the cheat, the assassin, had not been suddenly converted into a great
 preacher without continuing in the practice of the said iniquities,
 whensoever the same was privily possible. And withal, having got
 himself made priest, as often as he celebrated at the altar, he would
 weep over the passion of our Lord, so there were folk in plenty to
 see, for tears cost him little enough, when he had a mind to shed
 them. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020011"/>In short, what with his sermons and his tears, he duped the
 folk of <placeName>Venice</placeName> to such a tune that scarce a will was there made but
 he was its executor and depositary; nay, not a few made him trustee
 of their moneys, and most, or well-nigh most, men and women alike,
 their confessor and counsellor: in short, he had put off the wolf and
 put on the shepherd, and the fame of his holiness was such in those
 parts that St. Francis himself had never the like at Assisi.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020012"/>Now it so befell that among the ladies that came to confess to this
 holy friar was one Monna Lisetta of Ca' Quirino, the young, silly,
 empty-headed wife of a great merchant, who was gone with the
 galleys to <placeName>Flanders</placeName>. Like a Venetian--for unstable are they all--though
 she placed herself at his feet, she told him but a part of her
 sins, and when Fra Alberto asked her whether she had a lover, 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020013"/>she
 replied with black looks: <q>How now, master friar? have you not
 eyes in your head? See you no difference between my charms and
 those of other women? Lovers in plenty might I have, so I would:
 but charms such as mine must not be cheapened: 'tis not every man
 that might presume to love me. How many ladies have you seen
 whose beauty is comparable to mine? I should adorn Paradise
 itself.</q> Whereto she added so much more in praise of her beauty
 that the friar could scarce hear her with patience. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020014"/>Howbeit, discerning
 at a glance that she was none too well furnished with sense,
 he deemed the soil meet for his plough, and fell forthwith inordinately
 in love with her, though he deferred his blandishments to a more
 convenient season, and by way of supporting his character for holiness
 began instead to chide her, telling her (among other novelties) that
 this was vainglory: whereto the lady retorted that he was a blockhead,
 and could not distinguish one degree of beauty from another.
 Wherefore Fra Alberto, lest he should occasion her too much chagrin,
 cut short the confession, and suffered her to depart with the other
 ladies. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020015"/>Some days after, accompanied by a single trusty friend, he
 <pb n="278"/>hied him to Monna Lisetta's house, and having withdrawn with her
 alone into a saloon, where they were safe from observation, he fell on
 his knees at her feet, and said: <q>Madam, for the love of God I
 crave your pardon of that which I said to you on Sunday, when you
 spoke to me of your beauty, for so grievously was I chastised therefor
 that very night, that 'tis but to-day that I have been able to quit
 my bed.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020016"/><q>And by whom,</q> quoth my Lady Battledore, <q>were
 you so chastised?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020017"/><q>I will tell you,</q> returned Fra Alberto.
 <q>That night I was, as is ever my wont, at my orisons, when suddenly
 a great light shone in my cell, and before I could turn me
 to see what it was, I saw standing over me a right goodly youth with
 a stout cudgel in his hand, who seized me by the habit and threw
 me at his feet and belaboured me till I was bruised from head to
 foot. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020018"/>And when I asked him why he used me thus, he answered:
 --''Tis because thou didst to-day presume to speak slightingly of
 the celestial charms of Monna Lisetta, whom I love next to God
 Himself.' <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020019"/>Whereupon I asked: 'And who are you?' And he
 made answer that he was the Angel Gabriel. Then said I: 'O
 my lord, I pray you pardon me.' Whereto he answered: 'I pardon
 thee on condition that thou go to her, with what speed thou mayst,
 and obtain her pardon, which if she accord thee not, I shall come
 back hither and give thee belabourings enough with my cudgel to
 make thee a sad man for the rest of thy days.' What more he
 said, I dare not tell you, unless you first pardon me.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020020"/>Whereat our
 flimsy pumpion-pated Lady Lackbrain was overjoyed, taking all the
 friar's words for gospel. So after a while she said: <q>And did I not
 tell you, Fra Alberto, that my charms were celestial? But, so help
 me God, I am moved to pity of you, and forthwith I pardon you,
 lest worse should befall you, so only you tell me what more the
 Angel said.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020021"/><q>So will I gladly, Madam,</q> returned Fra Alberto,
 <q>now that I have your pardon; this only I bid you bear in mind,
 that you have a care that never a soul in the world hear from you a
 single word of what I shall say to you, if you would not spoil your
 good fortune, wherein there is not to-day in the whole world a lady
 that may compare with you. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020022"/>Know then that the Angel Gabriel
 bade me tell you that you stand so high in his favour that again and
 again he would have come to pass the night with you, but that he
 doubted he should affright you. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020023"/>So now he sends you word through
 <pb n="279"/>me that he would fain come one night, and stay a while with you;
 and seeing that, being an angel, if he should visit you in his angelic
 shape, he might not be touched by you, he would, to pleasure you,
 present himself in human shape; and so he bids you send him word,
 when you would have him come, and in whose shape, and he will
 come; for which cause you may deem yourself more blessed than
 any other lady that lives.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020024"/>My Lady Vanity then said that she
 was highly flattered to be beloved of the Angel Gabriel; whom she
 herself loved so well that she had never grudged four soldi to burn
 a candle before his picture, wherever she saw it, and that he was
 welcome to visit her as often as he liked, and would always find her
 alone in her room; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020025"/>on the understanding, however, that he should
 not desert her for the Virgin Mary, whom she had heard he did
 mightily affect, and indeed 'twould so appear, for, wherever she saw
 him, he was always on his knees at her feet: for the rest he might
 even come in what shape he pleased, so that it was not such as to
 terrify her. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020026"/>Then said Fra Alberto: <q>Madam, 'tis wisely spoken;
 and I will arrange it all with him just as you say. But 'tis in your
 power to do me a great favour, which will cost you nothing; and
 this favour is that you be consenting that he visit you in my
 shape. Now hear wherein you will confer this favour: thus will it
 be: he will disembody my soul, and set it in Paradise, entering himself
 into my body; and, as long as he shall be with you, my soul will
 be in Paradise.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020027"/>Whereto my Lady Slenderwit: <q>So be it,</q> she
 said; <q>I am well pleased that you have this solace to salve the bruises
 that he gives you on my account.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020028"/><q>Good,</q> said Fra Alberto;
 <q>then you will see to it that to-night he find, when he comes, your
 outer door unlatched, that he may have ingress; for, coming, as he
 will, in human shape, he will not be able to enter save by the door.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020029"/><q>It shall be done,</q> replied the lady. Whereupon Fra Alberto took
 his leave, and the lady remained in such a state of exaltation that her
 nether end knew not her chemise, and it seemed to her a thousand
 years until the Angel Gabriel should come to visit her. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020030"/>Fra
 Alberto, bethinking him that 'twas not as an angel, but as a cavalier
 that he must acquit himself that night, fell to fortifying himself with
 comfits and other dainties, that he might not lose his saddle for
 slight cause. Then, leave of absence gotten, he betook him at nightfall,
 with a single companion, to the house of a woman that was his
 <pb n="280"/>friend, which house had served on former occasions as his base when
 he went a chasing the fillies; and having there disguised himself,
 he hied him, when he deemed 'twas time, to the house of the lady,
 where, donning the gewgaws he had brought with him, he transformed
 himself into an angel, and going up, entered the lady's
 chamber. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020031"/>No sooner saw she this dazzling apparition than she fell
 on her knees before the Angel, who gave her his blessing, raised her
 to her feet, and motioned her to go to bed. She, nothing loath,
 obeyed forthwith, and the Angel lay down beside his devotee. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020032"/>Now
 Fra Alberto was a stout, handsome fellow, whose legs bore themselves
 right bravely; and being bedded with Monna Lisetta, who was lusty
 and delicate, he covered her after another fashion than her husband
 had been wont, and took many a flight that night without wings, so
 that she heartily cried him content; and not a little therewithal did
 he tell her of the glory celestial. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020033"/>Then towards daybreak, all being
 ready for his return, he hied him forth, and repaired, caparisoned as
 he was, to his friend, whom, lest he should be affrighted, sleeping
 alone, the good woman of the house had solaced with her company.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020034"/>The lady, so soon as she had breakfasted, betook her to Fra Alberto,
 and reported the Angel Gabriel's visit, and what he had told her of
 the glory of the life eternal, describing his appearance, not without
 some added marvels of her own invention. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020035"/>Whereto Fra Alberto
 replied: <q>Madam, I know not how you fared with him; but this
 I know, that last night he came to me, and for that I had done his
 errand with you, he suddenly transported my soul among such a
 multitude of flowers and roses as was never seen here below, and my
 soul--what became of my body I know not--tarried in one of the
 most delightful places that ever was from that hour until matins.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020036"/><q>As for your body,</q> said the lady, <q>do I not tell you whose it was?
 It lay all night long with the Angel Gabriel in my arms; and if you
 believe me not, you have but to look under your left pap, where I
 gave the Angel a mighty kiss, of which the mark will last for some
 days.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020037"/><q>Why then,</q> said Fra Alberto, <q>I will even do to-day
 what 'tis long since I did, to wit, undress, that I may see if you say
 sooth.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020038"/>So they fooled it a long while, and then the lady went
 home, where Fra Alberto afterwards paid her many a visit without
 any let. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020039"/>However, one day it so befell that while Monna Lisetta
 was with one of her gossips canvassing beauties, she, being minded
 <pb n="281"/>to exalt her own charms above all others, and having, as we know,
 none too much wit in her pumpion-pate, observed: <q>Did you but
 know by whom my charms are prized, then, for sure, you would
 have nought to say of the rest.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020040"/>Her gossip, all agog to hear, for
 well she knew her foible, answered: <q>Madam, it may be as you say,
 but still, while one knows not who he may be, one cannot alter one's
 mind so rapidly.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020041"/>Whereupon my Lady Featherbrain: <q>Gossip,</q>
 said she, <q>'tis not for common talk, but he that I wot of is the
 Angel Gabriel, who loves me more dearly than himself, for that I
 am, so he tells me, the fairest lady in all the world, ay, and in the
 <placeName>Maremma</placeName> to boot.</q><note>With this ineptitude cf. the friar's <q>flowers
 and roses</q> on the preceding
 page.</note><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020042"/>Whereat her gossip would fain have laughed,
 but held herself in, being minded to hear more from her. Wherefore
 she said: <q>God's faith, Madam, if 'tis the Angel Gabriel, and
 he tells you so, why, so of course it must needs be; but I wist
 not the angels meddled with such matters.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020043"/><q>There you erred,
 gossip,</q> said the lady: <q>zounds, he does it better than my husband,
 and he tells me they do it above there too, but, as he rates my
 charms above any that are in heaven, he is enamoured of me, and
 not seldom visits me: so now dost see?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020044"/>So away went the gossip
 so agog to tell the story, that it seemed to her a thousand years till
 she was where it might be done; and being met for recreation with
 a great company of ladies, she narrated it all in detail: whereby it
 passed to the ladies' husbands, and to other ladies, and from them to
 yet other ladies, so that in less than two days all <placeName>Venice</placeName> was full of
 it. But among others, whose ears it reached, were Monna Lisetta's
 brothers-in-law, who, keeping their own counsel, resolved to find
 this angel and make out whether he knew how to fly; to which end
 they kept watch for some nights. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020045"/>Whereof no hint, as it happened,
 reached Fra Alberto's ears; and so, one night when he was come to
 enjoy the lady once more, he was scarce undressed when her brothers-in-law,
 who had seen him come, were at the door of the room and
 already opening it, when Fra Alberto, hearing the noise and apprehending
 the danger, started up, and having no other resource, threw open
 a window that looked on to the Grand Canal, and plunged into the
 water. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020046"/>The depth was great, and he was an expert swimmer; so
 that he took no hurt, but, having reached the other bank, found a
 <pb n="282"/>house open, and forthwith entered it, praying the good man that was
 within, for God's sake to save his life, and trumping up a story to
 account for his being there at so late an hour, and stripped to the
 skin. The good man took pity on him, and having occasion to go
 out, he put him in his own bed, bidding him stay there until his
 return; and so, having locked him in, he went about his business.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020047"/>Now when the lady's brothers-in-law entered the room, and found
 that the Angel Gabriel had taken flight, leaving his wings behind him,
 being baulked of their prey, they roundly rated the lady, and then,
 leaving her disconsolate, betook themselves home with the Angel's
 spoils. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020048"/>Whereby it befell, that, when 'twas broad day, the good man,
 being on the <placeName>Rialto</placeName>, heard tell how the Angel Gabriel had come to
 pass the night with Monna Lisetta, and, being surprised by her
 brothers-in-law, had taken fright, and thrown himself into the Canal,
 and none knew what was become of him. The good man guessed
 in a trice that the said Angel was no other than the man he had at
 home, whom on his return he recognized, and, after much chaffering,
 brought him to promise him fifty ducats that he might not be given
 up to the lady's brothers-in-law. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020049"/>The bargain struck, Fra Alberto
 signified a desire to be going. Whereupon: <q>There is no way,</q>
 said the good man, <q>but one, if you are minded to take it. To-day
 we hold a revel, wherein folk lead others about in various disguises;
 as, one man will present a bear, another a wild man, and so forth;
 and then in the piazza of <placeName>San Marco</placeName> there is a hunt, which done, the
 revel is ended; and then away they hie them, whither they will, each
 with the man he has led about. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020050"/>If you are willing to be led by me
 in one or another of these disguises, before it can get wind that you
 are here, I can bring you whither you would go; otherwise I see not
 how you are to quit this place without being known; and the lady's
 brothers-in-law, reckoning that you must be lurking somewhere in this
 quarter, have set guards all about to take you.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020051"/>Loath indeed was Fra
 Alberto to go in such a guise, but such was his fear of the lady's relations
 that he consented, and told the good man whither he desired to be
 taken, and that he was content to leave the choice of the disguise
 to him. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020052"/>The good man then smeared him all over with honey, and
 covered him with down, set a chain on his neck and a vizard on
 his face, gave him a stout cudgel to carry in one hand, and two
 huge dogs, which he had brought from the shambles, to lead with
 <pb n="283"/>the other, and sent a man to the <placeName>Rialto</placeName> to announce that whoso would
 see the Angel Gabriel should hie him to the piazza of <placeName>San Marco</placeName>; in
 all which he acted as a leal Venetian. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020053"/>And so, after a while, he led
 him forth, and then, making him go before, held him by the chain
 behind, and through a great throng that clamoured: <q>What manner
 of thing is this? what manner of thing is this?</q> he brought him
 to the piazza, where, what with those that followed them, and those
 that had come from the <placeName>Rialto</placeName> on hearing the announcement, there
 were folk without end. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020054"/>Arrived at the piazza, he fastened his wild
 man to a column in a high and exposed place, making as if he were
 minded to wait till the hunt should begin; whereby the flies and
 gadflies, attracted by the honey with which he was smeared, caused
 him most grievous distress. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020055"/>However, the good man waited only
 until the piazza was thronged, and then, making as if he would
 unchain his wild man, he tore the vizard from Fra Alberto's face,
 saying: <q>Gentlemen, as the boar comes not to the hunt, and the hunt
 does not take place, that it be not for nothing that you are come hither,
 I am minded to give you a view of the Angel Gabriel, who comes
 down from heaven to earth by night to solace the ladies of <placeName>Venice</placeName>.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020056"/>The vizard was no sooner withdrawn than all recognized Fra Alberto,
 and greeted him with hootings, rating him in language as offensive
 and opprobrious as ever rogue was abused withal, and pelting him in
 the face with every sort of filth that came to hand: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020057"/>in which plight
 they kept him an exceeding great while, until by chance the bruit
 thereof reached his brethren, of whom some six thereupon put themselves
 in motion, and, arrived at the piazza, clapped a habit on his
 back, and unchained him, and amid an immense uproar led him off
 to their convent, where, after languishing a while in prison, 'tis believed
 that he died.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04020058"/>So this man, by reason that, being reputed righteous, he did evil,
 and 'twas not imputed to him, presumed to counterfeit the Angel
 Gabriel, and, being transformed into a wild man, was in the end put
 to shame, as he deserved, and vainly bewailed his misdeeds. God
 grant that so it may betide all his likes.</p></div><pb n="284"/><!--***************************Novella 3*************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0403"><head>Novel III</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04030001"/><!--(i)-->Three young men love three sisters, and flee with them to

 rich men and great merchants than are to be seen there to-day,
 among whom was one Narnald Cluada by name, a man of the lowest

 we may live in careless ease upon our substance, without any manner
 of doubt I trust so to prevail that the three sisters with great part of
 their father's substance shall come to live with us, wherever we shall
 see fit to go; whereby, each with his own lady, we shall live as
 three brethren, the happiest men in the world. 'Tis now for you to
 determine whether you will embrace this proffered solace, or let it
 slip from you.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04030015"/>The two young men, whose love was beyond all
 measure fervent, spared themselves the trouble of deliberation: 'twas
 enough that they heard that they were to have their ladies: wherefore
 they answered, that, so this should ensue, they were ready to do
 as he proposed. Having thus their answer, Restagnon a few days
 later was closeted with Ninette, to whom 'twas a matter of no small
 difficulty for him to get access. Nor had he been long with her
 before he adverted to what had passed between him and the young
 men, and sought to commend the project to her for reasons not a
 few. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04030016"/>Little need, however, had he to urge her: for to live their life
 openly together was the very thing she desired, far more than he:
 wherefore she frankly answered that she would have it so, that her
 <pb n="287"/>sisters would do, more especially in this matter, just as she wished,
 and that he should lose no time in making all the needful arrangements.
 So Restagnon returned to the two young men, who were
 most urgent that it should be done even as he said, and told them
 that on the part of the ladies the matter was concluded. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04030017"/>And so,
 having fixed upon <placeName>Crete</placeName> for their destination, and sold some estates
 that they had, giving out that they were minded to go a trading with
 the proceeds, they converted all else that they possessed into money,
 and bought a brigantine, which with all secrecy they handsomely
 equipped, anxiously expecting the time of their departure, while
 Ninette on her part, knowing well how her sisters were affected,
 did so by sweet converse foment their desire that, till it should be
 accomplished, they accounted their life as nought. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04030018"/>The night of
 their embarcation being come, the three sisters opened a great chest
 that belonged to their father, and took out therefrom a vast quantity
 of money and jewels, with which they all three issued forth of the
 house in dead silence, as they had been charged, and found their
 three lovers awaiting them; who, having forthwith brought them
 aboard the brigantine, bade the rowers give way, and, tarrying
 nowhere, arrived the next evening at <placeName>Genoa</placeName>, where the new lovers
 had for the first time joyance and solace of their love.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04030019"/>Having taken what they needed of refreshment, they resumed
 their course, touching at this port and that, and in less than eight
 days, speeding without impediment, were come to <placeName>Crete</placeName>. There
 they bought them domains both beautiful and broad, whereon, hard
 by <placeName>Candia</placeName> they built them mansions most goodly and delightsome,
 wherein they lived as barons, keeping a crowd of retainers, with
 dogs, hawks and horses, and speeding the time with their ladies in
 feasting and revelling and merrymaking, none so light-hearted as
 they. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04030020"/>Such being the tenor of their life, it so befell that (as 'tis
 matter of daily experience that, however delightsome a thing may
 be, superabundance thereof will breed disgust) Restagnon, much as
 he had loved Ninette, being now able to have his joyance of her
 without stint or restraint, began to weary of her, and by consequence
 to abate somewhat of his love for her. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04030021"/>And being mightily pleased
 with a fair gentlewoman of the country, whom he met at a merry-making,
 he set his whole heart upon her, and began to shew himself
 marvellously courteous and gallant towards her; which Ninette
 per<pb n="288"/>ceiving
 grew so jealous that he might not go a step but she knew of
 it, and resented it to his torment and her own with high words. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04030022"/>But
 as, while superfluity engenders disgust, appetite is but whetted when
 fruit is forbidden, so Ninette's wrath added fuel to the flame of
 Restagnon's new love. And whichever was the event, whether in
 course of time Restagnon had the lady's favour or had it not, Ninette,
 whoever may have brought her the tidings, firmly believed that he
 had it; whereby from the depths of distress she passed into a towering
 passion, and thus was transported into such a frenzy of rage that
 all the love she bore to Restagnon was converted into bitter hatred,
 and, blinded by her wrath, she made up her mind to avenge by
 Restagnon's death the dishonour which she deemed that he had done
 her. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04030023"/>So she had recourse to an old Greek woman, that was very
 skilful in compounding poisons, whom by promises and gifts she
 induced to distill a deadly water, which, keeping her own counsel,
 she herself gave Restagnon to drink one evening, when he was
 somewhat heated and quite off his guard: whereby--such was the
 efficacy of the water--she despatched Restagnon before matins. On
 learning his death Foulques and Hugues and their ladies, who knew
 not that he had been poisoned, united their bitter with Ninette's
 feigned lamentations, and gave him honourable sepulture. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04030024"/>But so it
 befell that, not many days after, the old woman, that had compounded
 the poison for Ninette, was taken for another crime; and, being put
 to the torture, confessed the compounding of the poison among other
 of her misdeeds, and fully declared what had thereby come to pass.
 Wherefore the Duke of <placeName>Crete</placeName>, breathing no word of his intent, came
 privily by night, and set a guard around <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04030025"/>Foulques' palace, where
 Ninette then was, and quietly, and quite unopposed, took and carried
 her off; and without putting her to the torture, learned from her in
 a trice all that he sought to know touching the death of Restagnon.
 Foulques and Hugues had learned privily of the Duke, and their
 ladies of them, for what cause Ninette was taken; and, being mightily
 distressed thereby, bestirred themselves with all zeal to save Ninette
 from the fire, to which they apprehended she would be condemned,
 as having indeed richly deserved it; but all their endeavours seemed
 to avail nothing, for the Duke was unwaveringly resolved that justice
 should be done. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04030026"/>Madeleine, Foulques' fair wife, who had long been
 courted by the Duke, but had never deigned to shew him the least
 <pb n="289"/>favour, thinking that by yielding herself to his will she might redeem
 her sister from the fire, despatched a trusty envoy to him with the
 intimation that she was entirely at his disposal upon the twofold
 condition, that in the first place her sister should be restored to her
 free and scatheless, and, in the second place, the affair should be kept
 secret. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04030027"/>Albeit gratified by this overture, the Duke was long in doubt
 whether he should accept it; in the end, however, he made up his
 mind to do so, and signified his approval to the envoy. Then with
 the lady's consent he put Foulques and Hugues under arrest for a
 night, as if he were minded to examine them of the affair, and
 meanwhile quartered himself privily with Madeleine. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04030028"/>Ninette, who,
 he had made believe, had been set in a sack, and was to be sunk
 in the sea that same night, he took with him, and presented her to
 her sister in requital of the night's joyance, which, as he parted from
 her on the morrow, he prayed her might not be the last, as it was
 the first, fruit of their love, at the same time enjoining her to send
 the guilty lady away that she might not bring reproach upon him,
 nor he be compelled to deal rigorously with her again. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04030029"/>Released the
 same morning, and told that Ninette had been cast into the sea,
 Foulques and Hugues, fully believing that so it was, came home,
 thinking how they should console their ladies for the death of their
 sister; but, though Madeleine was at great pains to conceal Ninette,
 Foulques nevertheless, to his no small amazement, discovered that
 she was there; which at once excited his suspicion, for he knew that
 the Duke had been enamoured of Madeleine; and he asked how it
 was that Ninette was there. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04030030"/>Madeleine made up a long story by
 way of explanation, to which his sagacity gave little credit, and in
 the end after long parley he constrained her to tell the truth. Whereupon,
 overcome with grief, and transported with rage, he drew his
 sword, and, deaf to her appeals for mercy, slew her. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04030031"/>Then, fearing
 the vengeful justice of the Duke, he left the dead body in the room,
 and hied him to Ninette, and with a counterfeit gladsome mien said
 to her: <q>Go we without delay whither thy sister has appointed
 that I escort thee, that thou fall not again into the hands of the
 Duke.</q> Ninette believed him, and being fain to go for very fear,
 she forewent further leave-taking of her sister, more particularly as
 it was now night, and set out with Foulques, who took with him
 such little money as he could lay his hands upon; and so they made
 <pb n="290"/>their way to the coast, where they got aboard a bark, but none ever
 knew where their voyage ended.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04030032"/>Madeleine's dead body being discovered next day, certain evildisposed
 folk, that bore a grudge to Hugues, forthwith apprised the
 Duke of the fact; which brought the Duke--for much he loved
 Madeleine--in hot haste to the house, where he arrested Hugues and
 his lady, who as yet knew nothing of the departure of Foulques and
 Ninette, and extorted from them a confession that they and Foulques
 were jointly answerable for Madeleine's death. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04030033"/>For which cause being
 justly apprehensive of death, they with great address corrupted the
 guards that had charge of them, giving them a sum of money which
 they kept concealed in their house against occasions of need; and
 together with the guards fled with all speed, leaving all that they
 possessed behind them, and took ship by night for <placeName>Rhodes</placeName>, where,
 being arrived, they lived in great poverty and misery no long time.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04030034"/>Such then was the issue, to which Restagnon, by his foolish love, and
 Ninette by her wrath brought themselves and others.</p></div><pb n="291"/><!--**************************Novella 4******************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0404"><head>Novel IV</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04040001"/><!--(i)--><persName>Gerbino</persName>, in breach of the plighted faith of his grandfather,

      had two children, a son named Ruggieri, and a daughter named
      Gostanza. Ruggieri died before his father, and left a son named
      <persName>Gerbino</persName>; who, being carefully trained by his grandfather, grew up a
      most goodly gallant, and of great renown in court and camp, 
      <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04040005"/>and
      that not only within the borders of <placeName>Sicily</placeName>, but in divers other parts
      <pb n="292"/>of the world, among them Barbary, then tributary to the King of
      <placeName>Sicily</placeName>. And among others, to whose ears was wafted the bruit of
      <persName>Gerbino</persName>'s magnificent prowess and courtesy, was a daughter of the
      King of <placeName>Tunis</placeName>, who, by averment of all that had seen her, was a
      creature as fair and debonair, and of as great and noble a spirit as
      Nature ever formed. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04040006"/>To hear tell of brave men was her delight, and
      what she heard, now from one, now from another, of the brave deeds
      of <persName>Gerbino</persName> she treasured in her mind so sedulously, and pondered
      them with such pleasure, rehearsing them to herself in imagination,
      that she became hotly enamoured of him, and there was none
      of whom she talked, or heard others talk, so gladly. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04040007"/>Nor, on the
      other hand, had the fame of her incomparable beauty and other
      excellences failed to travel, as to other lands, so also to <placeName>Sicily</placeName>, where,
      falling on <persName>Gerbino</persName>'s ears, it gave him no small delight, to such effect
      that he burned for the lady no less vehemently than she for him.
      <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04040008"/>Wherefore, until such time as he might, upon some worthy occasion,
      have his grandfather's leave to go to <placeName>Tunis</placeName>, yearning beyond measure
      to see her, he charged every friend of his, that went thither, to give
      her to know, as best he might, his great and secret love for her, and
      to bring him tidings of her. Which office one of the said friends
      discharged with no small address; for, having obtained access to her,
      after the manner of merchants, by bringing jewels for her to look at,
      he fully apprised her of <persName>Gerbino</persName>'s passion, and placed him, and all
      that he possessed, entirely at her disposal. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04040009"/>The lady received both
      messenger and message with gladsome mien, made answer that she
      loved with equal ardour, and in token thereof sent <persName>Gerbino</persName> one of
      her most precious jewels. <persName>Gerbino</persName> received the jewel with extreme
      delight, and sent her many a letter and many a most precious gift by
      the hand of the same messenger; and 'twas well understood between
      them that, should Fortune accord him opportunity, he should see
      and know her.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04040010"/>On this footing the affair remained somewhat longer than was
 expedient; and so, while <persName>Gerbino</persName> and the lady burned with mutual
 love, it befell that the King of <placeName>Tunis</placeName> gave her in marriage to the
 King of <placeName>Granada</placeName>;<note>An anachronism; the Moorish kingdom of <placeName>Granada</placeName> not
 having been
 founded until 1238.</note> whereat she was wroth beyond measure, for that
 <pb n="293"/>she was not only going into a country remote from her lover, but, as
 she deemed, was severed from him altogether; and so this might not
 come to pass, gladly, could she but have seen how, would she have
 left her father and fled to <persName>Gerbino</persName>. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04040011"/>In like manner, <persName>Gerbino</persName>, on
 learning of the marriage, was vexed beyond measure, and was ofttimes
 minded, could he but find means to win to her husband by
 sea, to wrest her from him by force. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04040012"/>Some rumour of <persName>Gerbino</persName>'s love,
 and of his intent, reached the King of <placeName>Tunis</placeName>, who, knowing his
 prowess and power, took alarm, and as the time drew nigh for
 conveying the lady to <placeName>Granada</placeName>, sent word of his purpose to King
 Guglielmo, and craved his assurance that it might be carried into
 effect without let or hindrance on the part of <persName>Gerbino</persName>, or any one
 else. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04040013"/>The old King had heard nothing of <persName>Gerbino</persName>'s love affair, and
 never dreaming that 'twas on such account that the assurance was
 craved, granted it without demur, and in pledge thereof sent the
 King of <placeName>Tunis</placeName> his glove. Which received, the King made ready
 a great and goodly ship in the port of <placeName>Carthage</placeName>, and equipped
 her with all things meet for those that were to man her, and
 with all appointments apt and seemly for the reception of his
 daughter, and awaited only fair weather to send her therein to
 <placeName>Granada</placeName>. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04040014"/>All which the young lady seeing and marking, sent
 one of her servants privily to <placeName>Palermo</placeName>, bidding him greet the
 illustrious <persName>Gerbino</persName> on her part, and tell him that a few days
 would see her on her way to <placeName>Granada</placeName>; wherefore 'twould now appear
 whether, or no, he were really as doughty a man as he was reputed,
 and loved her as much as he had so often protested. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04040015"/>The servant
 did not fail to deliver her message exactly, and returned to <placeName>Tunis</placeName>,
 leaving <persName>Gerbino</persName>, who knew that his grandfather, King Guglielmo,
 had given the King of <placeName>Tunis</placeName> the desired assurance, at a loss how to
 act. But prompted by love, and goaded by the lady's words and
 loath to seem a craven, he hied him to <placeName>Messina</placeName>; and having there
 armed two light galleys, and manned them with good men and true,
 he put to sea, and stood for <placeName>Sardinia</placeName>, deeming that the lady's ship must
 pass that way. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04040016"/>Nor was he far out in his reckoning; for he had
 not been there many days, when the ship, sped by a light breeze, hove
 in sight not far from the place where he lay in wait for her. Whereupon
 <persName>Gerbino</persName> said to his comrades: <q>Gentlemen, if you be as good
 men and true as I deem you, there is none of you but must have felt, if
 <pb n="294"/>he feel not now, the might of love; for without love I deem no
 mortal capable of true worth or aught that is good; and if you are
 or have been in love, 'twill be easy for you to understand that which
 I desire. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04040017"/>I love, and 'tis because I love that I have laid this travail
 upon you; and that which I love is in the ship that you see before
 you, which is fraught not only with my beloved, but with immense
 treasures, which, if you are good men and true, we, so we but play
 the man in fight, may with little trouble make our own; nor for
 my share of the spoils of the victory demand I aught but a lady,
 whose love it is that prompts me to take arms: all else I freely cede
 to you from this very hour. Forward, then; attack we this ship;
 success should be ours, for God favours our enterprise, nor lends her
 wind to evade us.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04040018"/>Fewer words might have sufficed the illustrious
 <persName>Gerbino</persName>; for the rapacious Messinese that were with him were
 already bent heart and soul upon that to which by his harangue he
 sought to animate them. So, when he had done, they raised a
 mighty shout, so that 'twas as if trumpets did blare, and caught up
 their arms, and smiting the water with their oars, overhauled the
 ship. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04040019"/>The advancing galleys were observed while they were yet a
 great way off by the ship's crew, who, not being able to avoid the
 combat, put themselves in a posture of defence. Arrived at close
 quarters, the illustrious <persName>Gerbino</persName> bade send the ship's masters aboard
 the galleys, unless they were minded to do battle. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04040020"/>Certified of the
 challenge, and who they were that made it, the Saracens answered
 that 'twas in breach of the faith plighted to them by their assailants'
 king that they were thus attacked, and in token thereof displayed
 King Guglielmo's glove, averring in set terms that there should be
 no surrender either of themselves or of aught that was aboard the
 ship without battle. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04040021"/><persName>Gerbino</persName>, who had observed the lady standing
 on the ship's poop, and seen that she was far more beautiful than he
 had imagined, burned with a yet fiercer flame than before, and to
 the display of the glove made answer, that, as he had no falcons there
 just then, the glove booted him not; wherefore, so they were not
 minded to surrender the lady, let them prepare to receive battle.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04040022"/>Whereupon, without further delay, the battle began on both sides
 with a furious discharge of arrows and stones; on which wise it was
 long protracted to their common loss; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04040023"/>until at last <persName>Gerbino</persName>, seeing
 that he gained little advantage, took a light bark which they had
 <pb n="295"/>brought from <placeName>Sardinia</placeName>, and having fired her, bore down with her,
 and both the galleys, upon the ship. Whereupon the Saracens,
 seeing that they must perforce surrender the ship or die, caused the
 King's daughter, who lay beneath the deck weeping, to come up on
 deck, and led her to the prow, and shouting to <persName>Gerbino</persName>, while the
 lady shrieked alternately <q>mercy</q> and <q>succour,</q> opened her veins
 before his eyes, and cast her into the sea, saying: <q>Take her; we
 give her to thee on such wise as we can, and as thy faith has merited.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04040024"/>Maddened to witness this deed of barbarism, <persName>Gerbino</persName>, as if courting
 death, recked no more of the arrows and the stones, but drew alongside
 the ship, and, despite the resistance of her crew, boarded her;
 and as a famished lion ravens amongst a herd of oxen, and tearing
 and rending, now one, now another, gluts his wrath before he appeases
 his hunger, so <persName>Gerbino</persName>, sword in hand, hacking and hewing on all
 sides among the Saracens, did ruthlessly slaughter not a few of them;
 till, as the burning ship began to blaze more fiercely, he bade the
 seamen take thereout all that they might by way of guerdon, which
 done, he quitted her, having gained but a rueful victory over his
 adversaries. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04040025"/>His next care was to recover from the sea the body of
 the fair lady, whom long and with many a tear he mourned: and
 so he returned to <placeName>Sicily</placeName>, and gave the body honourable sepulture in
 <placeName>Ustica</placeName>, an islet that faces, as it were, <placeName>Trapani</placeName>, and went home the
 saddest man alive.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04040026"/>When these tidings reached the King of <placeName>Tunis</placeName>, he sent to King
 Guglielmo ambassadors, habited in black, who made complaint
 of the breach of faith and recited the manner of its occurrence.
 Which caused King Guglielmo no small chagrin; and seeing not
 how he might refuse the justice they demanded, he had <persName>Gerbino</persName>
 arrested, and he himself, none of his barons being able by any
 entreaty to turn him from his purpose, sentenced him to forfeit his
 head, and had it severed from his body in his presence, preferring
 to suffer the loss of his only grandson than to gain the reputation of
 a faithless king. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04040027"/>And so, miserably, within the compass of a few
 brief days, died the two lovers by woeful deaths, as I have told you,
 and without having known any joyance of their love.</p></div><pb n="296"/><!--********************************Novella 5*******************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0405"><head>Novel V</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04050001"/><!--(i)--><persName>Lisabetta</persName>'s brothers slay her lover: he appears to her in

 them; and being come to a remote and very lonely spot, seeing that
 'twas apt for their design, they took <persName>Lorenzo</persName>, who was completely
 off his guard, and slew him, and buried him on such wise that none
 was ware of it. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04050009"/>On their return to <placeName>Messina</placeName> they gave out that they
 had sent him away on business; which was readily believed, because
 'twas what they had been frequently used to do. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04050010"/>But as <persName>Lorenzo</persName>
 did not return, and <persName>Lisabetta</persName> questioned the brothers about him with
 great frequency and urgency, being sorely grieved by his long
 absence, it so befell that one day, when she was very pressing in her
 enquiries, one of the brothers said: <q>What means this? What
 hast thou to do with <persName>Lorenzo</persName>, that thou shouldst ask about him so
 often? Ask us no more, or we will give thee such answer as thou
 deservest.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04050011"/>So the girl, sick at heart and sorrowful, fearing she
 knew not what, asked no questions; but many a time at night she
 called piteously to him, and besought him to come to her, and
 bewailed his long tarrying with many a tear, and ever yearning for
 his return, languished in total dejection.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04050012"/>But so it was that one night, when, after long weeping that her
 <persName>Lorenzo</persName> came not back, she had at last fallen asleep, <persName>Lorenzo</persName>
 appeared to her in a dream, wan and in utter disarray, his clothes
 torn to shreds and sodden; and thus, as she thought, he spoke:
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04050013"/><q><persName>Lisabetta</persName>, thou dost nought but call me, and vex thyself for my
 long tarrying, and bitterly upbraid me with thy tears; wherefore be
 <pb n="298"/>it known to thee that return to thee I may not, because the last day
 that thou didst see me thy brothers slew me.</q> After which, he
 described the place where they had buried him, told her to call and
 expect him no more, and vanished. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04050014"/>The girl then awoke, and
 doubting not that the vision was true, wept bitterly. And when
 morning came, and she was risen, not daring to say aught to her
 brothers, she resolved to go to the place indicated in the vision, and
 see if what she had dreamed were even as it had appeared to her.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04050015"/>So, having leave to go a little way out of the city for recreation in
 company with a maid that had at one time lived with them and
 knew all that she did, she hied her thither with all speed; and having
 removed the dry leaves that were strewn about the place, she began
 to dig where the earth seemed least hard. Nor had she dug long,
 before she found the body of her hapless lover, whereon as yet
 there was no trace of corruption or decay; and thus she saw without
 any manner of doubt that her vision was true. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04050016"/>And so, saddest of
 women, knowing that she might not bewail him there, she would
 gladly, if she could, have carried away the body and given it more
 honourable sepulture elsewhere; but as she might not so do, she
 took a knife, and, as best she could, severed the head from the trunk,
 and wrapped it in a napkin and laid it in the lap of her maid; and
 having covered the rest of the corpse with earth, she left the spot,
 having been seen by none, and went home. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04050017"/>There she shut herself
 up in her room with the head, and kissed it a thousand times in every
 part, and wept long and bitterly over it, till she had bathed it in her
 tears. She then wrapped it in a piece of fine cloth, and set it in a
 large and beautiful pot of the sort in which marjoram or basil is
 planted, and covered it with earth, and therein planted some roots
 of the goodliest basil of <placeName>Salerno</placeName>, and drenched them only with her
 tears, or water perfumed with roses or orange-blossoms. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04050018"/>And 'twas
 her wont ever to sit beside this pot, and, all her soul one yearning, to
 pore upon it, as that which enshrined her <persName>Lorenzo</persName>, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04050019"/>and when long
 time she had so done, she would bend over it, and weep a great
 while, until the basil was quite bathed in her tears.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04050020"/>Fostered with such constant, unremitting care, and nourished by
 the richness given to the soil by the decaying head that lay therein,
 the basil burgeoned out in exceeding great beauty and fragrance.
 And, the girl persevering ever in this way of life, the neighbours from
 <pb n="299"/>time to time took note of it, and when her brothers marvelled to see
 her beauty ruined, and her eyes as it were evanished from her head,
 they told them of it, saying: <q>We have observed that such is her
 daily wont.</q> Whereupon the brothers, marking her behaviour, chid
 her therefore once or twice, and as she heeded them not, caused the
 pot to be taken privily from her. Which, so soon as she missed it,
 she demanded with the utmost instance and insistence, and, as they
 gave it not back to her, ceased not to wail and weep, insomuch that
 she fell sick; nor in her sickness craved she aught but the pot of
 basil. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04050021"/>Whereat the young men, marvelling mightily, resolved to
 see what the pot might contain; and having removed the earth they
 espied the cloth, and therein the head, which was not yet so decayed,
 but that by the curled locks they knew it for <persName>Lorenzo</persName>'s head. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04050022"/>Passing
 strange they found it, and fearing lest it should be bruited abroad,
 they buried the head, and, with as little said as might be, took order
 for their privy departure from <placeName>Messina</placeName>, and hied them thence to
 <placeName>Naples</placeName>. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04050023"/>The girl ceased not to weep and crave her pot, and, so
 weeping, died. Such was the end of her disastrous love; but not a
 few in course of time coming to know the truth of the affair, there
 was one that made the song that is still sung: to wit:</p><floatingText type="song"><body><lg><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04050024"/><l>A thief he was, I swear,</l><l>A sorry Christian he,</l><l>That took my basil of <placeName>Salerno</placeName> fair, etc.</l></lg><note>This Sicilian folk-song, of which Boccaccio quotes only the first two

	almost as soon as they were told by those that had dreamed them.
	<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04060004"/>Wherefore, loving ladies, you must know that 'tis the common
	experience of mankind to have divers visions during sleep; and albeit
	the sleeper, while he sleeps, deems all alike most true, but, being
	awake, judges some of them to be true, others to be probable, and

 Messer Negro da Ponte Carraro, who with other children had a
 very fair daughter, Andreuola by name, who, being unmarried,
 chanced to fall in love with a neighbour, one <persName>Gabriotto</persName>, a man of
 low degree, but goodly of person and debonair, and endowed with
 all admirable qualities; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04060009"/>and aided and abetted by the housemaid, the
 girl not only brought it to pass that <persName>Gabriotto</persName> knew that he was
 beloved of her, but that many a time to their mutual delight he
 came to see her in a fair garden belonging to her father. And that
 nought but death might avail to sever them from this their gladsome
 love, they became privily man and wife; and, while thus they
 continued their clandestine intercourse, it happened that one night,
 while the girl slept, she saw herself in a dream in her garden with
 <persName>Gabriotto</persName>, who to the exceeding great delight of both held her in his
 arms; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04060010"/>and while thus they lay, she saw issue from his body somewhat
 dark and frightful, the shape whereof she might not discern;
 which, as she thought, laid hold of <persName>Gabriotto</persName>, and in her despite
 with prodigious force reft him from her embrace, and bore him with
 it underground, so that both were lost to her sight for evermore:
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04060011"/>whereby stricken with sore and inexpressible grief, she awoke; and
 albeit she was overjoyed to find that 'twas not as she had dreamed,
 yet a haunting dread of what she had seen in her vision entered her
 <pb n="304"/>soul. Wherefore, <persName>Gabriotto</persName> being minded to visit her on the ensuing
 night, she did her best endeavour to dissuade him from coming; but
 seeing that he was bent upon it, lest he should suspect somewhat,
 she received him in her garden, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04060012"/>where, having culled roses many,
 white and red--for 'twas summer--she sat herself down with him
 at the base of a most fair and lucent fountain. There long and
 joyously they dallied, and then <persName>Gabriotto</persName> asked her wherefore she
 had that day forbade his coming. Whereupon the lady told him
 her dream of the night before, and the doubt and fear which it had
 engendered in her mind. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04060013"/>Whereat <persName>Gabriotto</persName> laughed, and said that
 'twas the height of folly to put any faith in dreams, for that they
 were occasioned by too much or too little food, and were daily seen
 to be, one and all, things of nought, adding: 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04060014"/><q>Were I minded to
 give heed to dreams, I should not be here now, for I, too, had a
 dream last night, which was on this wise: Methought I was in
 a fair and pleasant wood, and there, a hunting, caught a she-goat as
 beautiful and loveable as any that ever was seen, and, as it seemed to
 me, whiter than snow, which in a little while grew so tame and
 friendly that she never stirred from my side. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04060015"/>All the same so jealous
 was I lest she should leave me, that, meseemed, I had set a collar of
 gold around her neck, and held her by a golden chain. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04060016"/>And presently
 meseemed that, while the she-goat lay at rest with her head in my
 lap, there came forth, I knew not whence, a greyhound bitch, black
 as coal, famished, and most fearsome to look upon; which made
 straight for me, and for, meseemed, I offered no resistance, set her
 muzzle to my breast on the left side and gnawed through to the
 heart, which, meseemed, she tore out to carry away with her.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04060017"/>Whereupon ensued so sore a pain that it brake my sleep, and as I
 awoke I laid my hand to my side to feel if aught were amiss there;
 but finding nothing I laughed at myself that I had searched. But
 what signifies it all? Visions of the like sort, ay, and far more
 appalling, have I had in plenty, and nought whatever, great or small,
 has come of any of them. So let it pass, and think we how we may
 speed the time merrily.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04060018"/>What she heard immensely enhanced the already great dread
 which her own dream had inspired in the girl; but, not to vex
 <persName>Gabriotto</persName>, she dissembled her terror as best she might. But, though
 she made great cheer, embracing and kissing him, and receiving his
 <pb n="305"/>embraces and kisses, yet she felt a doubt, she knew not why, and
 many a time, more than her wont, she would gaze upon his face,
 and ever and anon her glance would stray through the garden to
 see if any black creature were coming from any quarter. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04060019"/>While
 thus they passed the time, of a sudden <persName>Gabriotto</persName> heaved a great
 sigh, and embracing her, said: <q>Alas! my soul, thy succour! for
 I die.</q> And so saying, he fell down upon the grassy mead. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04060020"/>Whereupon
 the girl drew him to her, and laid him on her lap, and all
 but wept, and said: <q>O sweet my lord, what is't that ails thee?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04060021"/>But <persName>Gabriotto</persName> was silent, and gasping sore for breath, and bathed
 in sweat, in no long time departed this life.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04060022"/>How grievous was the distress of the girl, who loved him more
 than herself, you, my ladies, may well imagine. With many a tear
 she mourned him, and many times she vainly called him by his
 name; but when, having felt his body all over, and found it cold in
 every part, she could no longer doubt that he was dead, knowing not
 what to say or do, she went, tearful and woebegone, to call the
 maid, to whom she had confided her love, and shewed her the
 woeful calamity that had befallen her. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04060023"/>Piteously a while they wept
 together over the dead face of <persName>Gabriotto</persName>, and then the girl said to
 the maid: <q>Now that God has reft him from me, I have no
 mind to linger in this life; but before I slay myself, I would we
 might find apt means to preserve my honour, and the secret of our
 love, and to bury the body from which the sweet soul has fled.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04060024"/><q>My daughter,</q> said the maid, <q>speak not of slaying thyself, for
 so wouldst thou lose in the other world, also, him that thou hast
 lost here; seeing that thou wouldst go to hell, whither, sure I am,
 his soul is not gone, for a good youth he was; far better were it to
 put on a cheerful courage, and bethink thee to succour his soul with
 thy prayers or pious works, if perchance he have need thereof by
 reason of any sin that he may have committed. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04060025"/>We can bury him
 readily enough in this garden, nor will any one ever know; for
 none knows that he ever came hither; and if thou wilt not have
 it so, we can bear him forth of the garden, and leave him there;
 and on the morrow he will be found, and carried home, and buried
 by his kinsfolk.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04060026"/>The girl, heavy-laden though she was with
 anguish, and still weeping, yet gave ear to the counsels of her maid,
 and rejecting the former alternative, made answer to the latter on
 <pb n="306"/>this wise: <q>Now God forbid that a youth so dear, whom I have
 so loved and made my husband, should with my consent be buried
 like a dog, or left out there in the street. He has had my tears, and
 so far as I may avail, he shall have the tears of his kinsfolk, and
 already wot I what we must do.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04060027"/>And forthwith she sent the maid
 for a piece of silken cloth, which she had in one of her boxes; and
 when the maid returned with it, they spread it on the ground, and
 laid <persName>Gabriotto</persName>'s body thereon, resting the head upon a pillow. She
 then closed the eyes and mouth, shedding the while many a tear,
 wove for him a wreath of roses, and strewed upon him all the roses
 that he and she had gathered; which done, she said to the maid:
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04060028"/><q>'Tis but a short way hence to the door of his house; so thither we
 will bear him, thou and I, thus as we have dight him, and will lay
 him at the door. Day will soon dawn, and they will take him up;
 and, though 'twill be no consolation to them, I, in whose arms he
 died, shall be glad of it.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04060029"/>So saying, she burst once more into a
 torrent of tears, and fell with her face upon the face of the dead, and
 so long time she wept. Then, yielding at last to the urgency of her
 maid, for day was drawing nigh, she arose, drew from her finger the
 ring with which she had been wedded to <persName>Gabriotto</persName>, and set it on
 his finger, saying with tears: 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04060030"/><q>Dear my lord, if thy soul be witness
 of my tears, or if, when the spirit is fled, aught of intelligence or
 sense still lurk in the body, graciously receive the last gift of her
 whom in life thou didst so dearly love.</q> Which said, she swooned,
 and fell upon the corpse; 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04060031"/>but, coming after a while to herself, she
 arose; and then she and her maid took the cloth whereon the body
 lay, and so bearing it, quitted the garden, and bent their steps towards
 the dead man's house. As thus they went, it chanced that certain
 of the Podestà's guard, that for some reason or another were abroad
 at that hour, met them, and arrested them with the corpse. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04060032"/>Andreuola,
 to whom death was more welcome than life, no sooner knew
 them for the officers of the Signory than she frankly said: <q>I know
 you, who you are, and that flight would avail me nothing: I am
 ready to come with you before the Signory, and to tell all there is to
 tell; but let none of you presume to touch me, so long as I obey
 you, or to take away aught that is on this body, if he would not that
 I accuse him.</q> And so, none venturing to lay hand upon either her
 person or the corpse, she entered the palace.</p><pb n="307"/><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04060033"/>So soon as the Podestà was apprised of the affair, he arose,
 had
 her brought into his room, and there made himself conversant with
 the circumstances: and certain physicians being charged to inquire
 whether the good man had met his death by poison or otherwise, all
 with one accord averred that 'twas not by poison, but that he was
 choked by the bursting of an imposthume near the heart. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04060034"/>Which
 when the Podestà heard, perceiving that the girl's guilt could but
 be slight, he sought to make a pretence of giving what it was not
 lawful for him to sell her, and told her that he would set her at
 liberty, so she were consenting to pleasure him; 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04060035"/>but finding that he
 did but waste his words he cast aside all decency, and would have
 used force. Whereupon Andreuola, kindling with scorn, waxed
 exceeding brave, and defended herself with a virile energy, and with
 high and contumelious words drove him from her.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04060036"/>When 'twas broad day, the affair reached the ears of Messer
 Negro, who, half dead with grief, hied him with not a few of his
 friends to the palace; where, having heard all that the Podestà had
 to say, he required him peremptorily to give him back his daughter.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04060037"/>The Podestà, being minded rather to be his own accuser, than that
 he should be accused by the girl of the violence that he had meditated
 towards her, began by praising her and her constancy, and in proof
 thereof went on to tell what he had done; he ended by saying, that,
 marking her admirable firmness, he had fallen mightily in love with
 her, and so, notwithstanding she had been wedded to a man of low
 degree, he would, if 'twere agreeable to her and to her father, Messer
 Negro, gladly make her his wife. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04060038"/>While they thus spoke, Andreuola
 made her appearance, and, weeping, threw herself at her father's feet,
 saying: <q>My father, I wot I need not tell you the story of my
 presumption, and the calamity that has befallen me, for sure I am
 that you have heard it and know it; wherefore, with all possible
 humility I crave your pardon of my fault, to wit, that without your
 knowledge I took for my husband him that pleased me best. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04060039"/>And
 this I crave, not that my life may be spared, but that I may die as
 your daughter and not as your enemy;</q> and so, weeping, she fell at
 his feet. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04060040"/>Messer Negro, now an old man, and naturally kindly and
 affectionate, heard her not without tears, and weeping raised her
 tenderly to her feet, saying: <q>Daughter mine, I had much liefer
 had it that thou hadst had a husband that I deemed a match for thee;
 <pb n="308"/>and in that thou hadst taken one that pleased thee I too had been
 pleased; but thy concealing thy choice from me is grievous to me
 by reason of thy distrust of me, and yet more so, seeing that thou
 hast lost him before I have known him. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04060041"/>But as 'tis even so, to his
 remains be paid the honour which, while he lived for thy contentment,
 I had gladly done him as my son-in-law.</q> Then, turning to
 his sons and kinsmen, he bade them order <persName>Gabriotto</persName>'s obsequies with
 all pomp and honourable circumstance.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04060042"/>Meanwhile the young man's kinsmen and kinswomen, having
 heard the news, had flocked thither, bringing with them almost all the
 rest of the folk, men and women alike, that were in the city. And so
 his body, resting on Andreuola's cloth, and covered with her roses,
 was laid out in the middle of the courtyard, and there was mourned
 not by her and his kinsfolk alone, but publicly by well-nigh all the
 women of the city, and not a few men; and shouldered by some of
 the noblest of the citizens, as it had been the remains of no plebeian
 but of a noble, was borne from the public courtyard to the tomb
 with exceeding great pomp.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04060043"/>Some days afterwards, as the Podestà continued to urge his suit,
 Messer Negro would have discussed the matter with his daughter;
 but, as she would hear none of it, and he was minded in this matter

 maid most fair, and, for her rank, debonair--she was but a poor
 man's daughter--whose name was Simona; and though she must
 needs win with her own hands the bread she ate, and maintain
 herself by spinning wool; yet was she not, therefore, of so poor a
 <pb n="310"/>spirit, but that she dared to give harbourage in her mind to Love,
 who for some time had sought to gain entrance there by means of
 the gracious deeds and words of a young man of her own order that
 went about distributing wool to spin for his master, a wool-monger.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04070007"/>Love being thus, with the pleasant image of her beloved Pasquino,
 admitted into her soul, mightily did she yearn, albeit she hazarded no
 advance, and heaved a thousand sighs fiercer than fire with every
 skein of yarn that she wound upon her spindle, while she called to
 mind who he was that had given her that wool to spin. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04070008"/>Pasquino
 on his part became, meanwhile, very anxious that his master's wool
 should be well spun, and most particularly about that which Simona
 span, as if, indeed, it and it alone was to furnish forth the whole of
 the cloth. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04070009"/>And so, what with the anxiety which the one evinced,
 and the gratification that it afforded to the other, it befell that, the
 one waxing unusually bold, and the other casting off not a little
 of her wonted shyness and reserve, they came to an understanding
 for their mutual solace; which proved so delightful to both, that
 neither waited to be bidden by the other, but 'twas rather which
 should be the first to make the overture.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04070010"/>While thus they sped their days in an even tenor of delight, and
 ever grew more ardently enamoured of one another, Pasquino
 chanced to say to Simona that he wished of all things she would
 contrive how she might betake her to a garden, whither he would
 bring her, that there they might be more at their ease, and in greater
 security. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04070011"/>Simona said that she was agreeable; and, having given her
 father to understand that she was minded to go to <placeName>San Gallo</placeName> for the
 pardoning, she hied her with one of her gossips, <persName>Lagina</persName> by name, to
 the garden of which Pasquino had told her. Here she found
 Pasquino awaiting her with a friend, one Puccino, otherwise Stramba;
 and Stramba and <persName>Lagina</persName> falling at once to love-making, Pasquino
 and Simona left a part of the garden to them, and withdrew to
 another part for their own solace.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04070012"/>Now there was in their part of the garden a very fine and lovely
 sage-bush, at foot of which they sat them down and made merry
 together a great while, and talked much of a junketing they meant
 to have in the garden quite at their ease. By and by Pasquino,
 turning to the great sage-bush, plucked therefrom a leaf, and fell to
 rubbing his teeth and gums therewith, saying that sage was an
 <pb n="311"/>excellent detergent of aught that remained upon them after a meal.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04070013"/>Having done so, he returned to the topic of the junketing of which
 he had spoken before. But he had not pursued it far before his
 countenance entirely changed, and forthwith he lost sight and speech,
 and shortly after died. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04070014"/>Whereupon Simona fell a weeping and
 shrieking and calling Stramba and <persName>Lagina</persName>; who, notwithstanding
 they came up with all speed, found Pasquino not only dead but
 already swollen from head to foot, and covered with black spots both
 on the face and on the body; whereupon Stramba broke forth
 with: <q>Ah! wicked woman! thou hast poisoned him;</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04070015"/>and made
 such a din that 'twas heard by not a few that dwelt hard by the
 garden; who also hasted to the spot, and seeing Pasquino dead and
 swollen, and hearing Stramba bewail himself and accuse Simona of
 having maliciously poisoned him, while she, all but beside herself for
 grief to be thus suddenly bereft of her lover, knew not how to defend
 herself, did all with one accord surmise that 'twas even as Stramba
 said. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04070016"/>Wherefore they laid hands on her, and brought her, still
 weeping bitterly, to the palace of the Podestà: where at the instant
 suit of Stramba, backed by Atticciato and <persName>Malagevole</persName>, two other
 newly-arrived friends of Pasquino, a judge forthwith addressed himself
 to question her of the matter; and being unable to discover
 that she had used any wicked practice, or was guilty, he resolved to
 take her with him and go see the corpse, and the place, and the
 manner of the death, as she had recounted it to him; for by her
 words he could not well understand it. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04070017"/>So, taking care that there
 should be no disturbance, he had her brought to the place where
 Pasquino's corpse lay swollen like a tun, whither he himself presently
 came, and marvelling as he examined the corpse, asked her
 how the death had come about. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04070018"/>Whereupon, standing by the sagebush,
 she told him all that had happened, and that he might perfectly
 apprehend the occasion of the death, she did as Pasquino had
 done, plucked one of the leaves from the bush, and rubbed her teeth
 with it. Whereupon Stramba and Atticciato, and the rest of the
 friends and comrades of Pasquino, making in the presence of the
 judge open mock of what she did, as an idle and vain thing, and
 being more than ever instant to affirm her guilt, and to demand the
 fire as the sole condign penalty, the poor creature, that, between
 grief for her lost lover and dread of the doom demanded by Stramba,
 <pb n="312"/>stood mute and helpless, was stricken no less suddenly, and in the
 same manner, and for the same cause (to wit, that she had rubbed
 her teeth with the sage leaf) as Pasquino, to the no small amazement
 of all that were present.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04070019"/>Oh! happy souls for whom one and the same day was the
 term of ardent love and earthly life! Happier still, if to the
 same bourn ye fared! Ay, and even yet more happy, if love
 there be in the other world, and there, even as here, ye love!
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04070020"/>But happiest above all Simona, so far as we, whom she has left
 behind, may judge, in that Fortune brooked not that the witness of
 Stramba, Atticciato and <persName>Malagevole</persName>, carders, perchance, or yet viler
 fellows, should bear down her innocence, but found a more seemly
 issue, and, appointing her a like lot with her lover, gave her at once
 to clear herself from their foul accusation, and to follow whither the
 soul, that she so loved, of her Pasquino had preceded her!</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04070021"/>The judge, and all else that witnessed the event, remained long
 time in a sort of stupefaction, knowing not what to say of it; but at
 length recovering his wits, the judge said: <q>'Twould seem that
 this sage is poisonous, which the sage is not used to be. Let it be
 cut down to the roots and burned, lest another suffer by it in like
 sort.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04070022"/>Which the gardener proceeding to do in the judge's presence, no sooner
 had he brought the great bush down, than the cause of the deaths of
 the two lovers plainly appeared: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04070023"/>for underneath it was a toad of prodigious
 dimensions, from whose venomous breath, as they conjectured,
 the whole of the bush had contracted a poisonous quality. Around
 which toad, none venturing to approach it, they set a stout ring-fence
 of faggots, and burned it together with the sage. So ended Master
 Judge's inquest on the death of hapless Pasquino, 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04070024"/>who with his
 Simona, swollen as they were, were buried by Stramba, Atticciato,
 Guccio Imbratta, and <persName>Malagevole</persName> in the church of <placeName>San Paolo</placeName>, of

 once in our city a very great and wealthy merchant, Leonardo
 Sighieri by name, who had by his lady a son named Girolamo, after
 whose birth he departed this life, leaving his affairs in meet and due
 order; and well and faithfully were they afterwards administered in
 <pb n="314"/>the interest of the boy by his mother and guardians. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04080006"/>As he grew
 up, consorting more frequently with the neighbours' children than
 any others of the quarter, he made friends with a girl of his own
 age that was the daughter of a tailor; and in course of time this
 friendship ripened into a love so great and vehement, that Girolamo
 was ever ill at ease when he saw her not; nor was her love for him
 a whit less strong than his for her. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04080007"/>Which his mother perceiving
 would not seldom chide him therefor and chastise him. And as
 Girolamo could not give it up, she confided her distress to his
 guardians, speaking--for by reason of her boy's great wealth she
 thought to make, as it were, an orange-tree out of a bramble--on
 this wise: 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04080008"/><q>This boy of ours, who is now scarce fourteen years
 old, is so in love with a daughter of one of our neighbours, a

 is the girl's name--that, if we part them not, he will, peradventure,
 none else witting, take her to wife some day, and I shall
 never be happy again; or, if he see her married to another, he will
 pine away; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04080009"/>to prevent which, methinks, you would do well to send
 him away to distant parts on the affairs of the shop; for so, being
 out of sight she will come at length to be out of mind, and then we
 can give him some well-born girl to wife.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04080010"/>Whereto the guardians
 answered, that 'twas well said, and that it should be so done to the
 best of their power: so they called the boy into the shop, and one
 of them began talking to him very affectionately on this wise:
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04080011"/><q>My son, thou art now almost grown up; 'twere well thou shouldst
 now begin to learn something for thyself of thy own affairs: wherefore
 we should be very well pleased if thou wert to go stay at <placeName>Paris</placeName>
 a while, where thou wilt see how we trade with not a little of thy
 wealth, besides which thou wilt there become a much better, finer,
 and more complete gentleman than thou couldst here, and when
 thou hast seen the lords and barons and seigneurs that are there in
 plenty, and hast acquired their manners, thou canst return hither.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04080012"/>The boy listened attentively, and then answered shortly that he
 would have none of it, for he supposed he might remain at <placeName>Florence</placeName>
 as well as another. Whereupon the worthy men plied him with fresh
 argument, but were unable to elicit other answer from him, and
 told his mother so. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04080013"/>Whereat she was mightily incensed, and gave
 him a great scolding, not for his refusing to go to <placeName>Paris</placeName>, but for his
 love; which done, she plied him with soft, wheedling words, and
 <pb n="315"/>endearing expressions and gentle entreaties that he would be pleased
 to do as his guardians would have him; whereby at length she prevailed
 so far, that he consented to go to <placeName>Paris</placeName> for a year and no more;
 and so 'twas arranged. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04080014"/>To <placeName>Paris</placeName> accordingly our ardent lover went,
 and there under one pretext or another was kept for two years. He
 returned more in love than ever, to find his Salvestra married to a
 good youth that was a tent-maker; whereat his mortification knew
 no bounds. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04080015"/>But, seeing that what must be must be, he sought to
 compose his mind; and, having got to know where she lived, he
 took to crossing her path, according to the wont of young men in
 love, thinking that she could no more have forgotten him than he
 her. 'Twas otherwise, however; she remembered him no more
 than if she had never seen him; or, if she had any recollection of
 him, she dissembled it: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04080016"/>whereof the young man was very soon ware,
 to his extreme sorrow. Nevertheless he did all that he could to
 recall himself to her mind; but, as thereby he seemed to be nothing
 advantaged, he made up his mind, though he should die for it, to
 speak to her himself. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04080017"/>So, being instructed as to her house by a neighbour,
 he entered it privily one evening when she and her husband
 were gone to spend the earlier hours with some neighbours, and hid
 himself in her room behind some tent-cloths that were stretched
 there, and waited till they were come back, and gone to bed, and he
 knew the husband to be asleep. Whereupon he got him to the
 place where he had seen Salvestra lie down, and said as he gently
 laid his hand upon her bosom: <q>O my soul, art thou yet asleep?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04080018"/>The girl was awake, and was on the point of uttering a cry, when
 he forestalled her, saying: <q>Hush! for God's sake. I am thy
 Girolamo.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04080019"/>Whereupon she, trembling in every limb: <q>Nay, but
 for God's sake, Girolamo, begone: 'tis past, the time of our childhood,
 when our love was excusable. Thou seest I am married;
 wherefore 'tis no longer seemly that I should care for any other man
 than my husband, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04080020"/>and so by the one God, I pray thee, begone; for,
 if my husband were to know that thou art here, the least evil that
 could ensue would be that I should never more be able to live with
 him in peace or comfort, whereas, having his love, I now pass my
 days with him in tranquil happiness.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04080021"/>Which speech caused the
 young man grievous distress; but 'twas in vain that he reminded
 her of the past, and of his love that distance had not impaired, and
 therewith mingled many a prayer and the mightiest protestations.
 <pb n="316"/><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04080022"/>Wherefore, yearning for death, he besought her at last that she would
 suffer him to lie a while beside her till he got some heat, for he was
 chilled through and through, waiting for her, and promised her that
 he would say never a word to her, nor touch her, and that as soon
 as he was a little warmed he would go away. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04080023"/>On which terms
 Salvestra, being not without pity for him, granted his request. So
 the young man lay down beside her, and touched her not; but,
 gathering up into one thought the love he had so long borne her,
 the harshness with which she now requited it, and his ruined hopes,
 resolved to live no longer, and in a convulsion, without a word, and
 with fists clenched, expired by her side.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04080024"/>After a while the girl, marvelling at his continence, and fearing
 lest her husband should awake, broke silence, saying: <q>Nay, but,
 Girolamo, why goest thou not?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04080025"/>But, receiving no answer, she
 supposed that he slept. Wherefore, reaching forth her hand to
 arouse him, she touched him and found him to her great surprise
 cold as ice; and touching him again and again somewhat rudely, and
 still finding that he did not stir, she knew that he was dead. Her
 grief was boundless, and 'twas long before she could bethink her how
 to act. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04080026"/>But at last she resolved to sound her husband's mind as to
 what should be done in such a case without disclosing that 'twas his
 own. So she awakened him, and told him how he was then bested,
 as if it were the affair of another, and then asked him, if such a thing
 happened to her, what course he would take. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04080027"/>The good man
 answered that he should deem it best to take the dead man privily
 home, and there leave him, bearing no grudge against the lady, who
 seemed to have done no wrong. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04080028"/><q>And even so,</q> said his wife, <q>it
 is for us to do;</q> and taking his hand, she laid it on the corpse.
 Whereat he started up in consternation, and struck a light, and without
 further parley with his wife, clapped the dead man's clothes
 upon him, and forthwith (confident in his own innocence) raised
 him on his shoulders, and bore him to the door of his house, where
 he set him down and left him.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04080029"/>Day came, and the dead man being found before his own door,
 there was a great stir made, particularly by his mother; the body
 was examined with all care from head to foot, and, no wound or trace
 of violence being found on it, the physicians were on the whole of
 opinion that, as the fact was, the man had died of grief. So the corpse
 was borne to a church, and thither came the sorrowing mother and
 <pb n="317"/>other ladies, her kinswomen and neighbours, and began to wail and
 mourn over it without restraint after our Florentine fashion. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04080030"/>And
 when the wailing had reached its height, the good man, in whose
 house the death had occurred, said to Salvestra: <q>Go wrap a
 mantle about thy head, and hie thee to the church, whither Girolamo
 has been taken, and go about among the women and list what
 they say of this matter, and I will do the like among the men, that
 we may hear if aught be said to our disadvantage.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04080031"/>The girl
 assented, for with tardy tenderness she now yearned to look on him
 dead, whom living she would not solace with a single kiss, and so to
 the church she went. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04080032"/>Ah! how marvellous to whoso ponders it, is
 the might of Love, and how unsearchable his ways! That heart,
 which, while Fortune smiled on Girolamo, had remained sealed to
 him, opened to him now that he was fordone, and, kindling anew
 with all its old flame, melted with such compassion that no sooner
 saw she his dead face, as there she stood wrapped in her mantle,
 than, edging her way forward through the crowd of women, she
 stayed not till she was beside the corpse; and there, uttering a piercing
 shriek, she threw herself upon the dead youth, and as her face
 met his, and before she might drench it with her tears, grief that had
 reft life from him had even so reft it from her.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04080033"/>The women strove to comfort her, and bade her raise herself a
 little, for as yet they knew her not; then, as she did not arise, they
 would have helped her, but found her stiff and stark, and so, raising
 her up, they in one and the same moment saw her to be Salvestra
 and dead. Whereat all the women that were there, overborne by
 a redoubled pity, broke forth in wailing new and louder far than
 before. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04080034"/>From the church the bruit spread itself among the men,
 and reached the ears of Salvestra's husband, who, deaf to all that
 offered comfort or consolation, wept a long while; after which he
 told to not a few that were there what had passed in the night
 between the youth and his wife; and so 'twas known of all how
 they came to die, to the common sorrow of all. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04080035"/>So they took the
 dead girl, and arrayed her as they are wont to array the dead, and
 laid her on the same bed beside the youth, and long time they
 mourned her: then were they both buried in the same tomb, and
 thus those, whom love had not been able to wed in life, were wedded
 by death in indissoluble union.</p></div><pb n="318"/><!--*******************************Novella 9******************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0409"><head>Novel IX</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04090001"/><!--(i)-->Sieur Guillaume de Roussillon slays his wife's paramour,

 spoken than the lance was through Cabestaing's breast. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04090012"/>Powerless
 either to defend himself or even utter a cry, Cabestaing fell to the
 ground, and soon expired. His servants waited not to see who had
 done the deed, but turned their horses' heads and fled with all speed
 to their lord's castle. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04090013"/>Roussillon dismounted, opened Cabestaing's
 breast with a knife, and took out the heart with his own hands,
 wrapped it up in a banderole, and gave it to one of his servants to
 carry: he then bade none make bold to breathe a word of the affair,
 mounted his horse and rode back--'twas now night--to his castle.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04090014"/>The lady, who had been told that Cabestaing was to come to supper
 that evening, and was all impatience till he should come, was greatly
 surprised to see her husband arrive without him. Wherefore:
 <q>How is this, my lord?</q> said she. <q>Why tarries Cabestaing?</q><pb n="320"/><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04090015"/><q>Madam,</q> answered her husband, <q>I have tidings from him that he
 cannot be here until to-morrow:</q> whereat the lady was somewhat
 disconcerted.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04090016"/>Having dismounted, Roussillon called the cook, and said to him:
 <q>Here is a boar's heart; take it, and make thereof the daintiest
 and most delicious dish thou canst, and when I am set at table serve
 it in a silver porringer.</q> So the cook took the heart, and expended
 all his skill and pains upon it, mincing it and mixing with it plenty
 of good seasoning, and made thereof an excellent ragout; 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04090017"/>and in due
 time Sieur Guillaume and his lady sat them down to table. The
 meat was served, but Sieur Guillaume, his mind engrossed with his
 crime, ate but little. The cook set the ragout before him, but he,
 feigning that he cared to eat no more that evening, had it passed on
 to the lady, and highly commended it. The lady, nothing loath,
 took some of it, and found it so good that she ended by eating the
 whole. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04090018"/>Whereupon: <q>Madam,</q> quoth the knight, <q>how liked
 you this dish?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04090019"/><q>In good faith, my lord,</q> replied the lady, <q>not
 a little.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04090020"/><q>So help me, God,</q> returned the knight, <q>I dare be
 sworn you did; 'tis no wonder that you should enjoy that dead, which
 living you enjoyed more than aught else in the world.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04090021"/>For a while
 the lady was silent; then: <q>How say you?</q> said she; <q>what is
 this you have caused me to eat?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04090022"/><q>That which you have eaten,</q>
 replied the knight, <q>was in good sooth the heart of Sieur Guillaume
 de Cabestaing, whom you, disloyal woman that you are, did so much
 love: for assurance whereof I tell you that but a short while before
 I came back, I plucked it from his breast with my own hands.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04090023"/>It
 boots not to ask if the lady was sorrow-stricken to receive such tidings
 of her best beloved. But after a while she said: <q>'Twas the deed
 of a disloyal and recreant knight; for if I, unconstrained by him, made
 him lord of my love, and thereby did you wrong, 'twas I, not he,
 should have borne the penalty. But God forbid that fare of such
 high excellence as the heart of a knight so true and courteous as Sieur
 Guillaume de Cabestaing be followed by aught else.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04090024"/>So saying she
 started to her feet, and stepping back to a window that was behind
 her, without a moment's hesitation let herself drop backwards
 therefrom. The window was at a great height from the ground, so
 that the lady was not only killed by the fall, but almost reduced to
 atoms. Stunned and conscience-stricken by the spectacle, and fear<pb n="321"/>ing
 the vengeance of the country folk, and the Count of <placeName>Provence</placeName>,
 Sieur Guillaume had his horses saddled and rode away. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04090025"/>On the
 morrow the whole countryside knew how the affair had come about;
 wherefore folk from both of the castles took the two bodies, and bore
 them with grief and lamentation exceeding great to the church in the
 lady's castle, and laid them in the same tomb, and caused verses to
 be inscribed thereon signifying who they were that were there
 interred, and the manner and occasion of their death.</p></div><pb n="322"/><!--********************************Novella 10***************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0410"><head>Novel X</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100001"/><!--(i)-->The wife of a leech, deeming her lover, who has taken an

 since there dwelt at <placeName>Salerno</placeName> a leech most eminent in surgery, his
 name, Master Mazzeo della Montagna, who in his extreme old age
 took to wife a fair damsel of the same city, whom he kept in nobler
 and richer array of dresses and jewels, and all other finery that the
 sex affects, than any other lady in <placeName>Salerno</placeName>. Howbeit, she was none
 too warm most of her time, being ill covered abed by the doctor;
 <pb n="323"/><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100005"/>who gave her to understand--even as Messer Ricciardo di Chinzica,
 of whom we spoke a while since, taught his lady the feasts--that for
 once that a man lay with a woman he needed I know not how
 many days to recover, and the like nonsense: whereby she lived as
 ill content as might be; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100006"/>and, lacking neither sense nor spirit, she
 determined to economize at home, and taking to the street, to live
 at others' expense. So, having passed in review divers young men,
 she at last found one that was to her mind, on whom she set all her
 heart and hopes of happiness. Which the gallant perceiving was
 mightily flattered, and in like manner gave her all his love. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100007"/>Ruggieri
 da Jeroli--such was the gallant's name--was of noble birth, but of
 life and conversation so evil and reprehensible that kinsman or
 friend he had none left that wished him well, or cared to see him;
 and all <placeName>Salerno</placeName> knew him for a common thief and rogue of the vilest
 character. Whereof the lady took little heed, having a mind to him
 for another reason; and so with the help of her maid she arranged
 a meeting with him. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100008"/>But after they had solaced themselves a while,
 the lady began to censure his past life, and to implore him for love
 of her to depart from such evil ways; and to afford him the means
 thereto, she from time to time furnished him with money. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100009"/>While
 thus with all discretion they continued their intercourse, it chanced
 that a man halt of one of his legs was placed under the leech's care.
 The leech saw what was amiss with him, and told his kinsfolk, that,
 unless a gangrened bone that he had in his leg were taken out, he
 must die, or have the whole leg amputated; that if the bone were
 removed he might recover; but that otherwise he would not answer
 for his life: whereupon the relatives assented that the bone should
 be removed, and left the patient in the hands of the leech; 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100010"/>who,
 deeming that by reason of the pain 'twas not possible for him to
 endure the treatment without an opiate, caused to be distilled in the
 morning a certain water of his own concoction, whereby the patient,
 drinking it, might be ensured sleep during such time as he deemed
 the operation, which he meant to perform about vespers, would
 occupy. In the meantime he had the water brought into his house,
 and set it in the window of his room, telling no one what it was.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100011"/>But when the vesper hour was come, and the leech was about to
 visit his patient, a messenger arrived from some very great friends of
 his at <placeName>Amalfi</placeName>, bearing tidings of a great riot there had been there, in
 <pb n="324"/>which not a few had been wounded, and bidding him on no account
 omit to hie him thither forthwith. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100012"/>Wherefore the leech put off
 the treatment of the leg to the morrow, and took boat to <placeName>Amalfi</placeName>;
 and the lady, knowing that he would not return home that night,
 did as she was wont in such a case, to wit, brought Ruggieri in
 privily, and locked him in her chamber until certain other folk that
 were in the house were gone to sleep. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100013"/>Ruggieri, then, being thus in
 the chamber, awaiting the lady, and having--whether it were that
 he had had a fatiguing day, or eaten something salt, or, perchance,
 that 'twas his habit of body--a mighty thirst, glancing at the window,
 caught sight of the bottle containing the water which the leech had
 prepared for the patient, and taking it to be drinking water, set it
 to his lips and drank it all, and in no long time fell into a deep
 sleep.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100014"/>So soon as she was able the lady hied her to the room, and there
 finding Ruggieri asleep, touched him and softly told him to get up:
 to no purpose, however; he neither answered nor stirred a limb.
 Wherefore the lady, rather losing patience, applied somewhat more
 force, and gave him a push, saying: <q>Get up, sleepy-head; if
 thou hadst a mind to sleep, thou shouldst have gone home, and not
 have come hither.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100015"/>Thus pushed Ruggieri fell down from a box
 on which he lay, and, falling, shewed no more sign of animation
 than if he had been a corpse. The lady, now somewhat alarmed,
 essayed to lift him, and shook him roughly, and took him by the nose,
 and pulled him by the beard; again to no purpose: he had tethered
 his ass to a stout pin. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100016"/>So the lady began to fear he must be dead:
 however, she went on to pinch him shrewdly, and singe him with the
 flame of a candle; but when these methods also failed she, being, for
 all she was a leech's wife, no leech herself, believed for sure that he
 was dead; and as there was nought in the world that she loved so
 much, it boots not to ask if she was sore distressed; wherefore
 silently, for she dared not lament aloud, she began to weep over him
 and bewail such a misadventure. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100017"/>But, after a while, fearing lest her
 loss should not be without a sequel of shame, she bethought her that
 she must contrive without delay to get the body out of the house;
 and standing in need of another's advice, she quietly summoned her
 maid, shewed her the mishap that had befallen her, and craved her
 counsel. Whereat the maid marvelled not a little; and she too fell
 <pb n="325"/>to pulling Ruggieri this way and that, and pinching him, and, as she
 found no sign of life in him, concurred with her mistress that he was
 verily dead, and advised her to remove him from the house. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100018"/><q>And
 where,</q> said the lady, <q>shall we put him, that to-morrow, when he
 is discovered, it be not suspected that 'twas hence he was carried?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100019"/><q>Madam,</q> answered the maid, <q>late last evening I marked in front
 of our neighbour the carpenter's shop a chest, not too large, which,
 if he have not put it back in the house, will come in very handy
 for our purpose, for we will put him inside, and give him two or
 three cuts with a knife, and so leave him. When he is found, I
 know not why it should be thought that 'twas from this house rather
 than from any other that he was put there; nay, as he was an evilliver,
 'twill more likely be supposed, that, as he hied him on some
 evil errand, some enemy slew him, and then put him in the chest.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100020"/>The lady said there was nought in the world she might so ill brook
 as that Ruggieri should receive any wound; but with that exception
 she approved her maid's proposal, and sent her to see if the chest
 were still where she had seen it. The maid, returning, reported
 that there it was, and, being young and strong, got Ruggieri, with
 the lady's help, upon her shoulders; and so the lady, going before
 to espy if any folk came that way, and the maid following, they
 came to the chest, and having laid Ruggieri therein, closed it and
 left him there.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100021"/>Now a few days before, two young men, that were usurers, had
 taken up their quarters in a house a little further on: they had seen
 the chest during the day, and being short of furniture, and having
 a mind to make great gain with little expenditure, they had resolved
 that, if it were still there at night, they would take it home with
 them. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100022"/>So at midnight forth they hied them, and finding the chest,
 were at no pains to examine it closely, but forthwith, though it
 seemed somewhat heavy, bore it off to their house, and set it down
 beside a room in which their women slept; and without being at
 pains to adjust it too securely they left it there for the time, and
 went to bed.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100023"/>Towards matins Ruggieri, having had a long sleep and digested
 the draught and exhausted its efficacy, awoke, but albeit his slumber
 was broken, and his senses had recovered their powers, yet his brain
 remained in a sort of torpor which kept him bemused for some days;
 <pb n="326"/>and when he opened his eyes and saw nothing, and stretched his
 hands hither and thither and found himself in the chest, it was with
 difficulty that he collected his thoughts. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100024"/><q>How is this?</q> he said to
 himself. <q>Where am I? Do I sleep or wake? I remember
 coming this evening to my lady's chamber; and now it seems I am
 in a chest. What means it? Can the leech have returned, or
 somewhat else have happened that caused the lady, while I slept, to
 hide me here? That was it, I suppose. Without a doubt it must
 have been so.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100025"/>And having come to this conclusion, he composed
 himself to listen, if haply he might hear something, and being somewhat
 ill at ease in the chest, which was none too large, and the side
 on which he lay paining him, he must needs turn over to the other,
 and did so with such adroitness that, bringing his loins smartly
 against one of the sides of the chest, which was set on an uneven
 floor, he caused it to tilt and then fall; and such was the noise that
 it made as it fell that the women that slept there awoke, albeit for
 fear they kept silence. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100026"/>Ruggieri was not a little disconcerted by the
 fall, but, finding that thereby the chest was come open, he judged
 that, happen what might, he would be better out of it than in it;
 and not knowing where he was, and being otherwise at his wits' end,
 he began to grope about the house, if haply he might find a stair or
 door whereby he might take himself off. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100027"/>Hearing him thus groping
 his way, the alarmed women gave tongue with: <q>Who is there?</q>
 Ruggieri, not knowing the voice, made no answer: wherefore the
 women fell to calling the two young men, who, having had a long
 day, were fast asleep, and heard nought of what went on. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100028"/>Which
 served to increase the fright of the women, who rose and got them
 to divers windows, and raised the cry: <q>Take thief, take thief!</q>
 At which summons there came running from divers quarters not a
 few of the neighbours, who got into the house by the roof or otherwise
 as each best might: likewise the young men, aroused by the
 din, got up; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100029"/>and, Ruggieri being now all but beside himself for sheer
 amazement, and knowing not whither to turn him to escape them,
 they took him and delivered him to the officers of the Governor of
 the city, who, hearing the uproar, had hasted to the spot. And so
 he was brought before the Governor, who, knowing him to be held
 of all a most arrant evil-doer, put him forthwith to the torture, and,
 upon his confessing that he had entered the house of the usurers with
 <pb n="327"/>intent to rob, was minded to make short work of it, and have him
 hanged by the neck.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100030"/>In the morning 'twas bruited throughout all <placeName>Salerno</placeName> that
 Ruggieri had been taken a thieving in the house of the usurers.
 Whereat the lady and her maid were all amazement and bewilderment,
 insomuch that they were within an ace of persuading themselves
 that what they had done the night before they had not done,
 but had only dreamed it; besides which, the peril in which Ruggieri
 stood caused the lady such anxiety as brought her to the verge
 of madness. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100031"/>Shortly after half tierce the leech, being returned
 from <placeName>Amalfi</placeName>, and minded now to treat his patient, called for his
 water, and finding the bottle empty made a great commotion, protesting
 that nought in his house could be let alone. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100032"/>The lady,
 having other cause of annoy, lost temper, and said: <q>What would
 you say, Master, of an important matter, when you raise such a din
 because a bottle of water has been upset? Is there never another to
 be found in the world?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100033"/><q>Madam,</q> replied the leech, <q>thou takest
 this to have been mere water: 'twas no such thing, but an artificial
 water of a soporiferous virtue;</q> and he told her for what purpose he
 had made it. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100034"/>Which the lady no sooner heard, than, guessing that
 Ruggieri had drunk it, and so had seemed to them to be dead, she
 said: <q>Master, we knew it not; wherefore make you another.</q>
 And so the leech, seeing that there was no help for it, had another
 made. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100035"/>Not long after, the maid, who by the lady's command had
 gone to find out what folk said of Ruggieri, returned, saying:
 <q>Madam, of Ruggieri they say nought but evil, nor, by what I have
 been able to discover, has he friend or kinsman that has or will come
 to his aid; and 'tis held for certain that to-morrow the Stadic<note>The
 Neapolitan term for the chief of police.</note> will
 have him hanged. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100036"/>Besides which, I have that to tell you which will
 surprise you; for, methinks, I have found out how he came into the
 usurers' house. List, then, how it was: you know the carpenter in
 front of whose shop stood the chest we put Ruggieri into: he had
 to-day the most violent altercation in the world with one to whom
 it would seem the chest belongs, by whom he was required to make
 good the value of the chest, to which he made answer that he had
 not sold it, but that it had been stolen from him in the night. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100037"/>'Not
 <pb n="328"/>so,' said the other; 'thou soldst it to the two young usurers, as they
 themselves told me last night, when I saw it in their house at the
 time Ruggieri was taken.' 'They lie,' replied the carpenter. 'I
 never sold it them, but they must have stolen it from me last night;
 go we to them.' <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100038"/>So with one accord off they went to the usurers'
 house, and I came back here. And so, you see, I make out that
 'twas on such wise that Ruggieri was brought where he was found;
 but how he came to life again, I am at a loss to conjecture.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100039"/>The lady
 now understood exactly how things were, and accordingly told the
 maid what she had learned from the leech, and besought her to aid
 her to get Ruggieri off, for so she might, if she would, and at the
 same time preserve her honour. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100040"/><q>Madam,</q> said the maid, <q>do but
 shew me how; and glad shall I be to do just as you wish.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100041"/>Whereupon
 the lady, to whom necessity taught invention, formed her plan
 on the spur of the moment, and expounded it in detail to the maid;
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100042"/>who (as the first step) hied her to the leech, and, weeping, thus
 addressed him: <q>Sir, it behoves me to ask your pardon of a great
 wrong that I have done you.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100043"/><q>And what may that be?</q> inquired the leech. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100044"/><q>Sir,</q> said the maid, who ceased not to weep, <q>you
 know what manner of man is Ruggieri da Jeroli. Now he took a
 fancy to me, and partly for fear, partly for love, I this year agreed to
 be his mistress; and knowing yestereve that you were from home,
 he coaxed me into bringing him into your house to sleep with me in
 my room. Now he was athirst, and I, having no mind to be seen
 by your lady, who was in the hall, and knowing not whither I might
 sooner betake me for wine or water, bethought me that I had seen a
 bottle of water in your room, and ran and fetched it, and gave it him
 to drink, and then put the bottle back in the place whence I had
 taken it; touching which I find that you have made a great stir in
 the house. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100045"/>Verily I confess that I did wrong; but who is there
 that does not wrong sometimes? Sorry indeed am I to have so done,
 but 'tis not for such a cause and that which ensued thereon that
 Ruggieri should lose his life. Wherefore, I do most earnestly
 beseech you, pardon me, and suffer me to go help him as best I may
 be able.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100046"/>Wroth though he was at what he heard, the leech replied
 in a bantering tone: <q>Thy pardon thou hast by thine own deed;
 for, whereas thou didst last night think to have with thee a gallant
 that would thoroughly dust thy pelisse for thee, he was but a
 sleepy<pb n="329"/>head;
 wherefore get thee gone, and do what thou mayst for the
 deliverance of thy lover, and for the future look thou bring him not
 into the house; else I will pay thee for that turn and this to boot.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100047"/>The maid, deeming that she had come off well in the first brush,
 hied her with all speed to the prison where Ruggieri lay, and by her
 cajoleries prevailed upon the warders to let her speak with him; and
 having told him how he must answer the Stadic if he would get off,
 she succeeded in obtaining preaudience of the Stadic; 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100048"/>who, seeing
 that the baggage was lusty and mettlesome, was minded before he
 heard her to grapple her with the hook, to which she was by no
 means averse, knowing that such a preliminary would secure her a
 better hearing. When she had undergone the operation and was
 risen: <q>Sir,</q> said she, <q>you have here Ruggieri da Jeroli,
 apprehended
 on a charge of theft; which charge is false.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100049"/>Whereupon she
 told him the whole story from beginning to end, how she, being
 Ruggieri's mistress, had brought him into the leech's house and had
 given him the opiate, not knowing it for such, and taking him to be
 dead, had put him in the chest; and then recounting what she had
 heard pass between the carpenter and the owner of the chest, she
 shewed him how Ruggieri came into the house of the usurers.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100050"/>Seeing that 'twas easy enough to find out whether the story were
 true, the Stadic began by questioning the leech as to the water, and
 found that 'twas as she had said: he then summoned the carpenter,
 the owner of the chest and the usurers, and after much further
 parley ascertained that the usurers had stolen the chest during the
 night, and brought it into their house: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100051"/>finally he sent for Ruggieri,
 and asked him where he had lodged that night, to which Ruggieri
 answered that where he had lodged he knew not, but he well
 remembered going to pass the night with Master Mazzeo's maid, in
 whose room he had drunk some water by reason of a great thirst
 that he had; but what happened to him afterwards, except that, when
 he awoke, he found himself in a chest in the house of the usurers, he
 knew not. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100052"/>All which matters the Stadic heard with great interest,
 and caused the maid and Ruggieri and the carpenter and the
 usurers to rehearse them several times. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04100053"/>In the end, seeing that
 Ruggieri was innocent, he released him, and mulcted the usurers in
 fifteen ounces for the theft of the chest. How glad Ruggieri was
 thus to escape, it boots not to ask; and glad beyond measure was his
 <pb n="330"/>lady. And so, many a time did they laugh and make merry
 together over the affair, she and he and the dear maid that had
 proposed to give him a taste of the knife; and remaining constant in
 their love, they had ever better and better solace thereof. The like
 whereof befall me, sans the being put in the chest.</p></div><!--*****************************Conclusion*****************************--><div type="conclusion" corresp="d04conclu"><head>Conclusion</head><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p04970001"/>Heartsore as the gentle ladies had been made by the preceding

 of the Cypriotes, there was in the island of <placeName>Cyprus</placeName> a very great
 noble named Aristippus, a man rich in all worldly goods beyond all
 other of his countrymen, and who might have deemed himself
 incomparably blessed, but for a single sore affliction that Fortune had
 allotted him. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010004"/>Which was that among his sons he had one, the best
 grown and handsomest of them all, that was well-nigh a hopeless
 imbecile. His true name was Galesus; but, as neither his tutor's
 pains, nor his father's coaxing or chastisement, nor any other method
 had availed to imbue him with any tincture of letters or manners, <pb n="3"/>but
 he still remained gruff and savage of voice, and in his bearing
 liker to a beast than to a man, all, as in derision, were wont to call
 him Cimon, which in their language signifies the same as <q>bestione</q>
 (brute)<note>One of the augmentative forms of bestia.</note> in ours. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010005"/>The father, grieved beyond measure to see his
 son's life thus blighted, and having abandoned all hope of his recovery,
 nor caring to have the cause of his mortification ever before his
 eyes, bade him betake him to the farm, and there keep with his
 husbandmen. To Cimon the change was very welcome, because
 the manners and habits of the uncouth hinds were more to his taste
 than those of the citizens. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010006"/>So to the farm Cimon hied him, and
 addressed himself to the work thereof; and being thus employed, he
 chanced one afternoon as he passed, staff on shoulder, from one
 domain to another, to enter a plantation, the like of which for beauty
 there was not in those parts, and which was then--for 'twas the
 month of May--a mass of greenery; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010007"/>and, as he traversed it, he
 came, as Fortune was pleased to guide him, to a meadow girt in with
 trees exceeding tall, and having in one of its corners a fountain most
 fair and cool, beside which he espied a most beautiful girl lying
 asleep on the green grass, clad only in a vest of such fine stuff that it
 scarce in any measure veiled the whiteness of her flesh, and below the
 waist nought but an apron most white and fine of texture; and
 likewise at her feet there slept two women and a man, her slaves.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010008"/>No sooner did Cimon catch sight of her, than, as if he had never
 before seen form of woman, he stopped short, and leaning on his
 cudgel, regarded her intently, saying never a word, and lost in admiration.
 And in his rude soul, which, despite a thousand lessons, had
 hitherto remained impervious to every delight that belongs to urbane
 life, he felt the awakening of an idea, that bade his gross and coarse
 mind acknowledge, that this girl was the fairest creature that had ever
 been seen by mortal eye. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010009"/>And thereupon he began to distinguish
 her several parts, praising her hair, which shewed to him as gold, her
 brow, her nose and mouth, her throat and arms, and above all her
 bosom, which was as yet but in bud, and as he gazed, he changed
 of a sudden from a husbandman into a judge of beauty, and desired
 of all things to see her eyes, which the weight of her deep slumber
 kept close shut, and many a time he would fain have awakened <pb n="4"/>her,
 that he might see them. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010010"/>But so much fairer seemed she to
 him than any other woman that he had seen, that he doubted
 she must be a goddess; and as he was not so devoid of sense but
 that he deemed things divine more worthy of reverence than things
 mundane, he forbore, and waited until she should awake of her
 own accord; and though he found the delay overlong, yet,
 enthralled by so unwonted a delight, he knew not how to be
 going. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010011"/>However, after he had tarried a long while, it so befell
 that Iphigenia--such was the girl's name--her slaves still sleeping,
 awoke, and raised her head, and opened her eyes, and seeing
 Cimon standing before her, leaning on his staff, was not a little
 surprised, and said: <q>Cimon, what seekest thou in this wood at
 this hour?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010012"/>For Cimon she knew well, as indeed did almost all the
 country-side, by reason alike of his uncouth appearance as of the rank
 and wealth of his father. To Iphigenia's question he answered never
 a word; but as soon as her eyes were open, nought could he do but
 intently regard them, for it seemed to him that a soft influence
 emanated from them, which filled his soul with a delight that he had
 never before known. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010013"/>Which the girl marking began to misdoubt
 that by so fixed a scrutiny his boorish temper might be prompted to
 some act that should cause her dishonour: wherefore she roused her
 women, and got up, saying: <q>Keep thy distance, Cimon, in God's
 name.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010014"/>Whereto Cimon made answer: <q>I will come with thee.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010015"/>And, albeit the girl refused his escort, being still in fear of him, she
 could not get quit of him; but he attended her home; after which
 he hied him straight to his father's house, and announced that he was
 minded on no account to go back to the farm: which intelligence was
 far from welcome to his father and kinsmen; but nevertheless they
 suffered him to stay, and waited to see what might be the reason or
 his change of mind. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010016"/>So Cimon, whose heart, closed to all teaching,
 love's shaft, sped by the beauty of Iphigenia, had penetrated, did now
 graduate in wisdom with such celerity as to astonish his father and
 kinsmen, and all that knew him. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010017"/>He began by requesting his father
 to let him go clad in the like apparel, and with, in all respects, the
 like personal equipment as his brothers: which his father very gladly
 did. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010018"/>Mixing thus with the gallants, and becoming familiar with the
 manners proper to gentlemen, and especially to lovers, he very soon,
 to the exceeding great wonder of all, not only acquired the rudiments <pb n="5"/>of
 letters, but waxed most eminent among the philosophic wits.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010019"/>After which (for no other cause than the love he bore to Iphigenia)
 he not only modulated his gruff and boorish voice to a degree of
 smoothness suitable to urbane life, but made himself accomplished in
 singing and music; in riding also and in all matters belonging to
 war, as well by sea as by land, he waxed most expert and hardy. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010020"/>And
 in sum (that I go not about to enumerate each of his virtues in
 detail) he had not completed the fourth year from the day of his
 first becoming enamoured before he was grown the most gallant, and
 courteous, ay, and the most perfect in particular accomplishments, of
 the young cavaliers that were in the island of <placeName>Cyprus</placeName>. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010021"/>What then,
 gracious ladies, are we to say of Cimon? Verily nought else but
 that the high faculties, with which Heaven had endowed his noble
 soul, invidious Fortune had bound with the strongest of cords, and
 circumscribed within a very narrow region of his heart; all which
 cords Love, more potent than Fortune, burst and brake in pieces;
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010022"/>and then with the might, wherewith he awakens dormant powers, he
 brought them forth of the cruel obfuscation, in which they lay, into
 clear light, plainly shewing thereby, whence he may draw, and
 whither he may guide, by his beams the souls that are subject to
 his sway.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010023"/>Now, albeit by his love for Iphigenia Cimon was betrayed, as
 young lovers very frequently are, into some peccadillos, yet Aristippus,
 reflecting that it had turned him from a booby into a man, not
 only bore patiently with him, but exhorted him with all his heart to
 continue steadfast in his love <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010024"/>And Cimon, who still refused to be
 called Galesus, because 'twas as Cimon that Iphigenia had first
 addressed him, being desirous to accomplish his desire by honourable
 means, did many a time urge his suit upon her father, Cipseus, that
 he would give her him to wife: whereto Cipseus always made the
 same answer, to wit, that he had promised her to Pasimondas, a
 young Rhodian noble, and was not minded to break faith with him.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010025"/>However, the time appointed for Iphigenia's wedding being come,
 and the bridegroom having sent for her, Cimon said to himself:
 'Tis now for me to shew thee, O Iphigenia, how great is my love
 for thee: 'tis by thee that I am grown a man, nor doubt I, if I
 shall have thee, that I shall wax more glorious than a god, and verily
 thee will I have, or die. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010026"/>Having so said, he privily enlisted in his
 <pb n="6"/>cause
 certain young nobles that were his friends, and secretly fitted
 out a ship with all equipment meet for combat, and put to sea on the
 look-out for the ship that was to bear Iphigenia to <placeName>Rhodes</placeName> and her
 husband. And at length, when her father had done lavishing
 honours upon her husband's friends, Iphigenia embarked, and, the
 mariners shaping their course for <placeName>Rhodes</placeName>, put to sea. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010027"/>Cimon was on
 the alert, and overhauled them the very next day, and standing on
 his ship's prow shouted amain to those that were aboard Iphigenia's
 ship: <q>Bring to; strike sails, or look to be conquered and sunk in
 the sea.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010028"/>Then, seeing that the enemy had gotten their arms above
 deck, and were making ready to make a fight of it, he followed up his
 words by casting a grapnel upon the poop of the Rhodians, who were
 making great way; and having thus made their poop fast to his prow,
 he sprang, fierce as a lion, reckless whether he were followed or no,
 on to the Rhodians' ship, making, as it were, no account of them,
 and animated by love, hurled himself, sword in hand, with prodigious
 force among the enemy, and cutting and thrusting right and left,
      slaughtered them like sheep; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010029"/>insomuch that the Rhodians, marking
 the fury of his onset, threw down their arms, and as with one voice
 did all acknowledge themselves his prisoners. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010030"/>To whom Cimon:
 <q>Gallants,</q> quoth he, <q>'twas neither lust of booty nor enmity to
 you that caused me to put out from <placeName>Cyprus</placeName> to attack you here with
 force of arms on the high seas. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010031"/>Moved was I thereto by that which
 to gain is to me a matter great indeed, which peaceably to yield me
 is to you but a slight matter; for 'tis even Iphigenia, whom more
 than aught else I love; whom, as I might not have her of her father
 in peaceable and friendly sort, Love has constrained me to take from
 you in this high-handed fashion and by force of arms; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010032"/>to whom I
 mean to be even such as would have been your Pasimondas: wherefore
 give her to me, and go your way, and God's grace go with
 you.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010033"/>Yielding rather to force than prompted by generosity, the Rhodians
 surrendered Iphigenia, all tears, to Cimon; who, marking her tears,
 said to her: <q>Grieve not, noble lady; thy Cimon am I, who, by my
 long love, have established a far better right to thee than Pasimondas
 by the faith that was plighted to him.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010034"/>So saying, he sent her aboard
 his ship, whither he followed her, touching nought that belonged to
 the Rhodians, and suffering them to go their way. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010035"/>To have gotten <pb n="7"/>so
 dear a prize made him the happiest man in the world, but for a
 time 'twas all he could do to assuage her grief: then, after taking
 counsel with his comrades, he deemed it best not to return to <placeName>Cyprus</placeName>
 for the present: and so, by common consent they shaped their course
 for <placeName>Crete</placeName>, where most of them, and especially Cimon, had alliances
 of old or recent date, and friends not a few, whereby they deemed
 that there they might tarry with Iphigenia in security. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010036"/>But Fortune,
 that had accorded Cimon so gladsome a capture of the lady, suddenly
 proved fickle, and converted the boundless joy of the enamoured
 gallant into woeful and bitter lamentation. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010037"/>'Twas not yet full four
 hours since Cimon had parted from the Rhodians, when with the
 approach of night, that night from which Cimon hoped such joyance
 as he had never known, came weather most turbulent and tempestuous,
 which wrapped the heavens in cloud, and swept the sea with scathing
 blasts; whereby 'twas not possible for any to see how the ship was
 to be worked or steered, or to steady himself so as to do any duty upon
 her deck. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010038"/>Whereat what grief was Cimon's, it boots not to ask.
 Indeed it seemed to him that the gods had granted his heart's desire
 only that it might be harder for him to die, which had else been to
 him but a light matter. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010039"/>Not less downcast were his comrades; but
 most of all Iphigenia, who, weeping bitterly and shuddering at every
 wave that struck the ship, did cruelly curse Cimon's love and censure
 his rashness, averring that this tempest was come upon them for no
 other cause than that the gods had decreed, that, as 'twas in despite
 of their will that he purposed to espouse her, he should be frustrate of
 his presumptuous intent, and having lived to see her expire, should
 then himself meet a woeful death.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010040"/>While thus and yet more bitterly they bewailed them, and the
 mariners were at their wits' end, as the gale grew hourly more violent,
 nor knew they, nor might conjecture, whither they went, they drew
 nigh the island of <placeName>Rhodes</placeName>, albeit that <placeName>Rhodes</placeName> it was they wist not,
 and set themselves, as best and most skilfully they might, to run the
 ship aground. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010041"/>In which enterprise Fortune favoured them, bringing
 them into a little bay, where, shortly before them, was arrived the
 Rhodian ship that Cimon had let go. Nor were they sooner ware
 that 'twas <placeName>Rhodes</placeName> they had made, than day broke, and, the sky thus
 brightening a little, they saw that they were about a bow-shot from
 the ship that they had released on the preceding day. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010042"/>Whereupon <pb n="8"/>Cimon,
 vexed beyond measure, being apprehensive of that which in
 fact befell them, bade make every effort to win out of the bay, and
 let Fortune carry them whither she would, for nowhere might they be
 in worse plight than there. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010043"/>So might and main they strove to bring
 the ship out, but all in vain: the violence of the gale thwarted them
 to such purpose as not only to preclude their passage out of the bay but
 to drive them, willing nilling, ashore. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010044"/>Whither no sooner were they
 come, than they were recognized by the Rhodian mariners, who were
 already landed. Of whom one ran with all speed to a farm hard by,
 whither the Rhodian gallants were gone, and told them that Fortune
 had brought Cimon and Iphigenia aboard their ship into the same
 bay to which she had guided them. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010045"/>Whereat the gallants were overjoyed,
 and taking with them not a few of the farm-servants, hied
 them in hot haste to the shore, where, Cimon and his men being
 already landed with intent to take refuge in a neighbouring wood,
 they took them all (with Iphigenia) and brought them to the farm.
 Whence, pursuant to an order of the Senate of <placeName>Rhodes</placeName>, to which, so
 soon as he received the news, Pasimondas made his complaint, Cimon
 and his men were all marched off to prison by Lysimachus, chief
 magistrate of the Rhodians for that year, who came down from the
 city for the purpose with an exceeding great company of men at
 arms. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010046"/>On such wise did our hapless and enamoured Cimon lose his
 so lately won Iphigenia before he had had of her more than a kiss
 or two. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010047"/>Iphigenia was entertained and comforted of the annoy,
 occasioned as well by her recent capture as by the fury of the sea, by
 not a few noble ladies of <placeName>Rhodes</placeName>, with whom she tarried until the
 day appointed for her marriage. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010048"/>In recompense of the release of the
 Rhodian gallants on the preceding day the lives of Cimon and his
 men were spared, notwithstanding that Pasimondas pressed might
 and main for their execution; and instead they were condemned to
 perpetual imprisonment: wherein, as may be supposed, they abode in
 dolorous plight, and despaired of ever again knowing happiness.</p><p>However, it so befell that, Pasimondas accelerating his nuptials to
 the best of his power, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010049"/>Fortune, as if repenting her that in her haste
 she had done Cimon so evil a turn, did now by a fresh disposition of
 events compass his deliverance. Pasimondas had a brother, by name
 Hormisdas, his equal in all respects save in years, who had long
 been contract to marry Cassandra, a fair and noble damsel of <pb n="9"/><placeName>Rhodes</placeName>,
 of whom Lysimachus was in the last degree enamoured;
 but owing to divers accidents the marriage had been from time to
 time put off. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010050"/>Now Pasimondas, being about to celebrate his nuptials
 with exceeding great pomp, bethought him that he could not do
 better than, to avoid a repetition of the pomp and expense, arrange, if
 so he might, that his brother should be wedded on the same day
 with himself. So, having consulted anew with Cassandra's kinsfolk,
 and come to an understanding with them, he and his brother and
 they conferred together, and agreed that on the same day that
 Pasimondas married Iphigenia, Hormisdas should marry Cassandra.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010051"/>Lysimachus, getting wind of this arrangement, was mortified beyond
 measure, seeing himself thereby deprived of the hope which he cherished
 of marrying Cassandra himself, if Hormisdas should not forestall
 him. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010052"/>But like a wise man he concealed his chagrin, and cast about
 how he might frustrate the arrangement: to which end he saw no
 other possible means but to carry Cassandra off. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010053"/>It did not escape
 him that the office which he held would render this easily feasible,
 but he deemed it all the more dishonourable than if he had not held
 the office; but, in short, after much pondering, honour yielded place
 to love, and he made up his mind that, come what might, he would
 carry Cassandra off. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010054"/>Then, as he took thought what company he
 should take with him, and how he should go about the affair, he
 remembered Cimon, whom he had in prison with his men, and it
 occurred to him that he could not possibly have a better or more trusty
 associate in such an enterprise than Cimon. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010055"/>Wherefore the same night
 he caused Cimon to be brought privily to him in his own room, and
 thus addressed him: <q>Cimon, as the gods are most generous and
 liberal to bestow their gifts on men, so are they also most sagacious
 to try their virtue; and those whom they find to be firm and steadfast
 in all circumstances they honour, as the most worthy, with the
 highest rewards. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010056"/>They have been minded to be certified of thy
 worth by better proofs than thou couldst afford them, as long as thy
 life was bounded by thy father's house amid the superabundant wealth
 which I know him to possess: wherefore in the first place they so
 wrought upon thee with the shrewd incitements of Love that from an
 insensate brute, as I have heard, thou grewest to be a man; since
 when, it has been and is their intent to try whether evil fortune and
 harsh imprisonment may avail to change thee from the temper that <pb n="10"/>was
 thine when for a short while thou hadst joyance of the prize
 thou hadst won. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010057"/>And so thou prove the same that thou wast then,
 they have in store for thee a boon incomparably greater than aught
 that they vouchsafed thee before: what that boon is, to the end thou
 mayst recover heart and thy wonted energies, I will now explain to
 thee. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010058"/>Pasimondas, exultant in thy misfortune and eager to compass thy
 death, hastens to the best of his power his nuptials with thy Iphigenia;
 that so he may enjoy the prize that Fortune, erstwhile smiling, gave
 thee, and forthwith, frowning, reft from thee. Whereat how sore
 must be thy grief, if rightly I gauge thy love, I know by my own
 case, seeing that his brother Hormisdas addresses himself to do me on
 the same day a like wrong in regard of Cassandra, whom I love more
 than aught else in the world. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010059"/>Nor see I that Fortune has left us
 any way of escape from this her unjust and cruel spite, save what we
 may make for ourselves by a resolved spirit and the might of our
 right hands: take we then the sword, and therewith make we, each,
 prize of his lady, thou for the second, I for the first time: for so thou
 value the recovery, I say not of thy liberty, for without thy lady I doubt
 thou wouldst hold it cheap, but of thy lady, the gods have placed it in
 thine own hands, if thou art but minded to join me in my enterprise.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010060"/>These words restored to Cimon all that he had lost of heart and
 hope, nor pondered he long, before he replied: <q>Lysimachus, comrade
 stouter or more staunch than I thou mightst not have in such
 an enterprise, if such indeed it be as thou sayst: wherefore lay upon
 me such behest as thou shalt deem meet, and thou shalt marvel to
 witness the vigour of my performance.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010061"/>Whereupon Lysimachus:
 <q>On the third day from now,</q> quoth he, <q>their husbands' houses
 will be newly entered by the brides, and on the same day at even we
 too will enter them in arms, thou with thy men, and I with some of
 mine, in whom I place great trust, and forcing our way among the
 guests and slaughtering all that dare to oppose us, will bear the ladies
 off to a ship which I have had privily got ready.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010062"/>Cimon approved
 the plan, and kept quiet in prison until the appointed time; 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010063"/>which being come, the nuptials were celebrated with great pomp and
 magnificence, that filled the houses of the two brothers with festal
 cheer. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010064"/>Then Lysimachus having made ready all things meet, and fired
 Cimon and his men and his own friends for the enterprise by a long
 harangue, disposed them in due time, all bearing arms under their
 <pb n="11"/>cloaks,
 in three companies; and having privily despatched one company
 to the port, that, when the time should come to embark, he might
 meet with no let, he marched with the other two companies to the
 house of Pasimondas, posted the one company at the gate, that, being
 entered, they might not be shut in or debarred their egress, and, with
 the other company and Cimon, ascended the stairs, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010065"/>and gained the
 saloon, where the brides and not a few other ladies were set at several
 tables to sup in meet order: whereupon in they rushed, and overthrew
 the tables and seized each his own lady, and placed them in
 charge of their men, whom they bade bear them off forthwith to the
 ship that lay ready to receive them. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010066"/>Whereupon the brides and the
 other ladies and the servants with one accord fell a sobbing and
 shrieking, insomuch that a confused din and lamentation filled the
 whole place. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010067"/>Cimon, Lysimachus and their band, none withstanding,
 but all giving way before them, gained the stairs, which they were
 already descending when they encountered Pasimondas, who, carrying
 a great staff in his hand, was making in the direction of the noise;
 but one doughty stroke of Cimon's sword sufficed to cleave his skull
 in twain, and lay him dead at Cimon's feet, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010068"/>and another stroke
 disposed of hapless Hormisdas, as he came running to his brother's
 aid. Some others who ventured to approach them were wounded
 and beaten off by the retinue. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010069"/>So forth of the house, that reeked
 with blood and resounded with tumult and lamentation and woe,
 sped Simon and Lysimachus with all their company, and without any
 let, in close order, with their fair booty in their midst, made good
 their retreat to the ship; whereon with the ladies they one and all
 embarked, for the shore was now full of armed men come to rescue
 the ladies, and, the oarsmen giving way, put to sea elate. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05010070"/>Arrived at
 <placeName>Crete</placeName>, they met with a hearty welcome on the part of their many
 friends and kinsfolk; and, having married their ladies, they made
 greatly merry, and had gladsome joyance of their fair booty. Their
 doings occasioned, both in <placeName>Cyprus</placeName> and in <placeName>Rhodes</placeName>, no small stir and
 commotion, which lasted for a long while: but in the end, by the
 good offices of their friends and kinsfolk in both islands, 'twas so
 ordered as that after a certain term of exile Cimon returned with
 Iphigenia to <placeName>Cyprus</placeName>, and in like manner Lysimachus returned with
 Cassandra to <placeName>Rhodes</placeName>; and long and blithely thereafter lived they,
 each well contented with his own wife in his own land.</p></div><pb n="12"/><!--*********************Novella 2******************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0502"><head>Novel II</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05020001"/><!--(i)-->Gostanza loves Martuccio Gomito, and hearing that he is

 an islet called <placeName>Lipari</placeName>, in which, no great while ago, there dwelt a
 damsel, Gostanza by name, fair as fair could be, and of one of the
 most honourable families in the island. And one Martuccio Gomito,
 who was also of the island, a young man most gallant and courteous,
 and worthy for his condition, became enamoured of Gostanza; 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05020005"/>who in like manner grew so afire for him that she was ever ill at ease,
 except she saw him. Martuccio, craving her to wife, asked her of
 her father, who made answer that, Martuccio being poor, he was not
 minded to give her to him. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05020006"/>Mortified to be thus rejected by reason
 of poverty, Martuccio took an oath in presence of some of his friends
 and kinsfolk that <placeName>Lipari</placeName> should know him no more, until he was
 wealthy. So away he sailed, and took to scouring the seas as a rover
 on the coast of Barbary, preying upon all whose force matched not <pb n="13"/>his
 own. In which way of life he found Fortune favourable enough,
 had he but known how to rest and be thankful: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05020007"/>but 'twas not
 enough that he and his comrades in no long time waxed very
 wealthy; their covetousness was inordinate, and, while they sought
 to gratify it, they chanced in an encounter with certain Saracen ships
 to be taken after a long defence, and despoiled, and, most part of
 them, thrown into the sea by their captors, who, after sinking his
 ship, took Martuccio with them to <placeName>Tunis</placeName>, and clapped him in prison,
 and there kept him a long time in a very sad plight.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05020008"/>Meanwhile, not by one or two, but by divers and not a few
 persons, tidings reached <placeName>Lipari</placeName> that all that were with Martuccio
 aboard his bark had perished in the sea. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05020009"/>The damsel, whose grief on
 Martuccio's departure had known no bounds, now hearing that he was
 dead with the rest, wept a great while, and made up her mind to
 have done with life; but, lacking the resolution to lay violent hands
 upon herself, she bethought her how she might devote herself to
 death by some novel expedient. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05020010"/>So one night she stole out of her
 father's house, and hied her to the port, and there by chance she
 found, lying a little apart from the other craft, a fishing boat, which,
 as the owners had but just quitted her, was still equipped with mast
 and sails and oars. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05020011"/>Aboard which boat she forthwith got, and being,
 like most of the women of the island, not altogether without nautical
 skill, she rowed some distance out to sea, and then hoisted sail, and
 cast away oars and tiller, and let the boat drift, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05020012"/>deeming that a boat
 without lading or steersman would certainly be either capsized by
 the wind or dashed against some rock and broken in pieces, so that
 escape she could not, even if she would, but must perforce drown.
 And so, her head wrapped in a mantle, she stretched herself weeping
 on the floor of the boat. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05020013"/>But it fell out quite otherwise than she
 had conjectured: for, the wind being from the north, and very
 equable, with next to no sea, the boat kept an even keel, and next
 day about vespers bore her to land hard by a city called <placeName>Susa</placeName>, full a
 hundred miles beyond <placeName>Tunis</placeName>. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05020014"/>To the damsel 'twas all one whether
 she were at sea or ashore, for, since she had been aboard, she had
 never once raised, nor, come what might, meant she ever to raise,
 her head.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05020015"/>Now it so chanced, that, when the boat grounded, there was on
 the shore a poor woman that was in the employ of some fishermen, <pb n="14"/>whose
 nets she was just taking out of the sunlight. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05020016"/>Seeing the
 boat under full sail, she marvelled how it should be suffered to drive
 ashore, and conjectured that the fishermen on board were asleep. So
 to the boat she hied her, and finding therein only the damsel fast
 asleep, she called her many times, and at length awakened her; and
 perceiving by her dress that she was a Christian, she asked her in
 Latin how it was that she was come thither all alone in the boat.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05020017"/>Hearing the Latin speech, the damsel wondered whether the wind
 had not shifted, and carried her back to <placeName>Lipari</placeName>: so up she started,
 gazed about her, and finding herself ashore and the aspect of the
 country strange, asked the good woman where she was. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05020018"/>To which
 the good woman made answer: <q>My daughter, thou art hard by
 <placeName>Susa</placeName> in Barbary.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05020019"/>Whereupon the damsel, sorrowful that God had
 not seen fit to accord her the boon of death, apprehensive of dishonour,
 and at her wits' end, sat herself down at the foot of her
 boat, and burst into tears. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05020020"/>Which the good woman saw not without
 pity, and persuaded her to come with her into her hut, and there by
 coaxing drew from her how she was come thither; and knowing
 that she could not but be fasting, she set before her her own coarse
 bread and some fish and water, and prevailed upon her to eat a little.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05020021"/>Gostanza thereupon asked her, who she was that thus spoke Latin;
 whereto she answered that her name was <persName>Carapresa</persName>, and that she
 was from <placeName>Trapani</placeName>, where she had served some Christian fishermen.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05020022"/>To the damsel, sad indeed though she was, this name <persName>Carapresa</persName>,
 wherefore she knew not, seemed to be of happy augury, so that she
 began to take hope, she knew not why, and to grow somewhat less
 fain of death: wherefore without disclosing who or whence she was,
 she earnestly besought the good woman for the love of God to have
 pity on her youth, and advise her how best to avoid insult. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05020023"/>Whereupon
 <persName>Carapresa</persName>, good woman that she was, left her in her hut, while
 with all speed she picked up her nets; and on her return she wrapped
 her in her own mantle, and led her to <placeName>Susa</placeName>. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05020024"/>Arrived there, she said
 to her: <q>Gostanza, I shall bring thee to the house of an excellent
 Saracen lady, for whom I frequently do bits of work, as she has
 occasion: she is an old lady and compassionate: I will commend
 thee to her care as best I may, and I doubt not she will right gladly
 receive thee, and entreat thee as her daughter: and thou wilt serve
 her, and, while thou art with her, do all thou canst to gain her favour,
 <pb n="15"/>until
 such time as God may send thee better fortune;</q> and as she
 said, so she did.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05020025"/>The old lady listened, and then, gazing steadfastly in the damsel's
 face, shed tears, and taking her hand, kissed her forehead, and led her
 into the house, where she and some other women dwelt quite by
 themselves, doing divers kinds of handiwork in silk and palm leaves
 and leather. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05020026"/>Wherein the damsel in a few days acquired some skill,
 and thenceforth wrought together with them; and rose wondrous
 high in the favour and good graces of all the ladies, who soon taught
 her their language.</p><!--Giuliana start from here--><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05020027"/>Now while the damsel, mourned at home as lost and dead, dwelt
 thus at <placeName>Susa</placeName>, it so befell that, Mariabdela being then King of <placeName>Tunis</placeName>,
 a young chieftain in <placeName>Granada</placeName>, of great power, and backed by mighty
 allies, gave out that the realm of <placeName>Tunis</placeName> belonged to him, and having
 gathered a vast army, made a descent upon <placeName>Tunis</placeName> with intent to
      expel the King from the realm. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05020028"/>Martuccio Gomito, who knew the
 language of Barbary well, heard the tidings in prison, and learning
 that the King of <placeName>Tunis</placeName> was mustering a mighty host for the defence
 of his kingdom, said to one of the warders that were in charge of
 him and his comrades: <q>If I might have speech of the King, I am
 confident that the advice that I should give him would secure him
 the victory.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05020029"/>The warder repeated these words to his chief, who
 forthwith carried them to the King. Wherefore by the King's command
 Martuccio was brought before him, and being asked by him
 what the advice, of which he had spoken, might be, answered on
 this wise: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05020030"/><q>Sire, if in old days, when I was wont to visit this
 country of yours, I duly observed the manner in which you order
 your battle, methinks you place your main reliance upon archers;
 and therefore, if you could contrive that your enemy's supply of
 arrows should give out and your own continue plentiful, I apprehend
 that you would win the battle.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05020031"/><q>Ay indeed,</q> replied the King, <q>I
 make no doubt that, could I but accomplish that, I should conquer.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05020032"/><q>Nay but, Sire,</q> returned Martuccio, <q>you may do it, if you will.
 Listen, and I will tell you how. You must fit the bows of your
 archers with strings much finer than those that are in common use,
 and match them with arrows, the notches of which will not admit
 any but these fine strings; and this you must do so secretly that
 your enemy may not know it, else he will find means to be even <pb n="16"/>with
 you.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05020033"/>Which counsel I give you for the following reason:
 When your and your enemy's archers have expended all their arrows,
 you wot that the enemy will fall to picking up the arrows that your
 men have shot during the battle, and your men will do the like by
 the enemy's arrows; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05020034"/> but the enemy will not be able to make use of
 your men's arrows, by reason that their fine notches will not suffice
 to admit the stout strings, whereas your men will be in the contrary
 case in regard of the enemy's arrows, for the fine string will very
 well receive the large-notched arrow, and so your men will have
 an abundant supply of arrows, while the enemy will be at a loss for
 them.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05020035"/>The King, who lacked not sagacity, appreciated Martuccio's
 advice, and gave full effect to it; whereby he came out of the war
 a conqueror, and Martuccio, being raised to the chief place in his
 favour, waxed rich and powerful.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05020036"/>Which matters being bruited
 throughout the country, it came to the ears of Gostanza that Martuccio
 Gomito, whom she had long supposed to be dead, was alive;
 whereby her love for him, some embers of which still lurked in her
 heart, burst forth again in sudden flame, and gathered strength, and
 revived her dead hope.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05020037"/>Wherefore she frankly told all her case to
 the good lady with whom she dwelt, saying that she would fain go
 to <placeName>Tunis</placeName>, that her eyes might have assurance of that which the
 report received by her ears had made them yearn to see.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05020038"/>The lady
 fell heartily in with the girl's desire, and, as if she had been her

 were honourably received in the house of one of her kinswomen.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05020039"/><persName>Carapresa</persName>, who had attended her, being sent to discover what she
 might touching Martuccio, brought back word that he was alive, and
 high in honour and place. The gentlewoman was minded that none
 but herself should apprise Martuccio of the arrival of his Gostanza:
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05020040"/>wherefore she hied her one day to Martuccio, and said: <q>Martuccio,
 there is come to my house a servant of thine from <placeName>Lipari</placeName>,
 who would fain speak with thee here privily, and for that he would
 not have me trust another, I am come hither myself to deliver his
 message.</q> Martuccio thanked her, and forthwith hied him with her
 to her house:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05020041"/>where no sooner did the girl see him than she all
 but died for joy, and carried away by her feelings, fell upon his neck
 with open arms and embraced him, and, what with sorrow of his <pb n="17"/>past
 woes and her present happiness, said never a word, but softly
 wept.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05020042"/>Martuccio regarded her for a while in silent wonder; then,
 heaving a sigh, he said: <q>Thou livest then, my Gostanza? Long
 since I heard that thou wast lost; nor was aught known of thee
 at home.</q> Which said, he tenderly and with tears embraced her.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05020043"/>Gostanza told him all her adventures, and how honourably she had
 been entreated by the gentlewoman with whom she had dwelt.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05020044"/>And so long time they conversed, and then Martuccio parted
 from her, and hied him back to his lord the King, and told him
 all, to wit, his own adventures and those of the girl, adding that
 with his leave he was minded to marry her according to our law.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05020045"/>Which matters the King found passing strange; and having called
 the girl to him, and learned from her that 'twas even as Martuccio
 had said: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05020046"/><q>Well indeed,</q> quoth he, <q>hast thou won thy husband.</q>
 Then caused he gifts most ample and excellent to be brought forth,
 part of which he gave to Gostanza, and part to Martuccio, leaving
 them entirely to their own devices in regard of one another.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05020047"/>Then
 Martuccio, in terms most honourable, bade farewell to the old lady
 with whom Gostanza had dwelt, thanking her for the service she
 had rendered to Gostanza, and giving her presents suited to her condition,
 and commending her to God, while Gostanza shed many a
 tear: after which, by leave of the King, they went aboard a light
 bark, taking with them <persName>Carapresa</persName>, and, sped by a prosperous breeze,
 arrived at <placeName>Lipari</placeName>, where they were received with such cheer as 'twere

  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05030007"/>Thus to see himself debarred of the one way by which he deemed

 towards a great forest, she planted the spurs in his sides, and so, holding
 on by the saddle-bow, was borne by the goaded creature into the
 forest at a gallop.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05030012"/>Pietro, who had been too engrossed with her face
 to give due heed to the way, and thus had not been ware, as soon as
 she, of the approach of the men at arms, was still looking about to
 see whence they were coming, when they came up with him, and
 took him prisoner, and forced him to dismount. Then they asked
 who he was, and, when he told them, they conferred among themselves,
 saying: <q>This is one of the friends of our enemies: what
 else can we do but relieve him of his nag and of his clothes, and hang
 him on one of these oaks in scorn of the Orsini?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05030013"/>To which
 proposal all agreeing, they bade Pietro strip himself: but while,
 already divining his fate, he was so doing, an ambuscade of full
 five-and-twenty
 men at arms fell suddenly upon them, crying: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05030014"/><q>Death,
 death!</q> Thus surprised, they let Pietro go, and stood on the
 defensive; but, seeing that the enemy greatly outnumbered them, <pb n="20"/>they
 took to their heels, the others giving chase. Whereupon Pietro
 hastily resumed his clothes, mounted his nag, and fled with all speed
 in the direction which he had seen the damsel take.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05030015"/>But finding no
 road or path through the forest, nor discerning any trace of a horse's
 hooves, he was--for that he found not the damsel--albeit he deemed
 himself safe out of the clutches of his captors and their assailants, the
 most wretched man alive, and fell a weeping and wandering hither and
 thither about the forest, uttering <persName>Agnolella</persName>'s name.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05030016"/>None answered;
 but turn back he dared not: so on he went, not knowing whither
 he went; besides which, he was in mortal dread of the wild beasts
 that infest the forest, as well on account of himself as of the damsel,
 whom momently he seemed to see throttled by some bear or wolf.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05030017"/>Thus did our unfortunate Pietro spend the whole day, wandering
 about the forest, making it to resound with his cries of <persName>Agnolella</persName>'s
 name, and harking at times back, when he thought to go forward;
 until at last, what with his cries and his tears and his fears and his
 long fasting, he was so spent that he could go no further.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05030018"/>'Twas
 then nightfall, and, as he knew not what else to do, he dismounted
 at the foot of an immense oak, and having tethered his nag to the
 trunk, climbed up into the branches, lest he should be devoured by
 the wild beasts during the night.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05030019"/>Shortly afterwards the moon rose
 with a very clear sky, and Pietro, who dared not sleep, lest he should
 fall, and indeed, had he been secure from that risk, his misery and
 his anxiety on account of the damsel would not have suffered him to
 sleep, kept watch, sighing and weeping and cursing his evil luck.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05030020"/>Now the damsel, who, as we said before, had fled she knew not
 whither, allowing her nag to carry her whithersoever he would,
 strayed so far into the forest that she lost sight of the place where
 she had entered it, and spent the whole day just as Pietro had done,
 wandering about the wilderness, pausing from time to time, and
 weeping, and uttering his name, and bewailing her evil fortune.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05030021"/>At
 last, seeing that 'twas now the vesper hour and Pietro came not, she
 struck into a path, which the nag followed, until, after riding some
 two miles, she espied at some distance a cottage, for which she made
 with all speed, and found there a good man, well stricken in years,
 with his wife, who was likewise aged.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05030022"/>Seeing her ride up alone,
 they said: <q>Daughter, wherefore ridest thou thus alone at this
 hour in these parts?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05030023"/>Weeping, the damsel made answer that she <pb n="21"/>had
 lost her companion in the forest, and asked how far might
 Anagni be from there? <q>My daughter,</q> returned the good man,
 <q>this is not the road to Anagni; 'tis more than twelve miles away.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05030024"/><q>And how far off,</q> inquired the damsel, <q>are the nearest houses in
 which one might find lodging for the night?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05030025"/><q>There are none
 so near,</q> replied the good man, <q>that thou canst reach them to-day.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05030026"/><q>Then, so please you,</q> said the damsel, <q>since go elsewhither I
 cannot, for God's sake let me pass the night here with you.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05030027"/>Whereto
 the good man made answer: <q>Damsel, welcome art thou to tarry
 the night with us; but still thou art to know that these parts are infested
 both by day and by night by bands, which, be they friends or be they
 foes, are alike ill to meet with, and not seldom do much despite and
 mischief, and if by misadventure one of these bands should visit us
 while thou wert here, and marking thy youth and beauty should do
 thee despite and dishonour, we should be unable to afford thee any
 succour.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05030028"/>This we would have thee know, that if it should so come
 to pass, thou mayst not have cause to reproach us.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05030029"/>The damsel
 heard not the old man's words without dismay; but, seeing that the
 hour was now late, she answered: <q>God, if He be so pleased, will
 save both you and me from such molestation, and if not, 'tis a much
 lesser evil to be maltreated by men than to be torn in pieces by the
 wild beasts in the forest.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05030030"/>So saying, she dismounted, and entered
 the cottage, where, having supped with the poor man and his wife
 on such humble fare as they had, she laid herself in her clothes
 beside them in their bed. She slept not, however; for her own evil
 plight and that of Pietro, for whom she knew not how to augur
 aught but evil, kept her sighing and weeping all night long.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05030031"/>And
 towards matins she heard a great noise as of men that marched; so
 up she got and hied her into a large courtyard that was in rear of the
 cottage, and part of which was covered with a great heap of hay,
 which she espying, hid herself therein, that, if the men came there,
 they might not so readily find her.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05030032"/>Scarce had she done so than the
 men, who proved to be a strong company of marauders, were at the
 door of the cottage, which they forced open; and having entered,
 and found the damsel's nag, still saddled, they asked who was there.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05030033"/>The damsel being out of sight, the good man answered: <q>There
 is none here but my wife and I; but this nag, which has given some
 one the slip, found his way hither last night, and we housed him, lest
 <pb n="22"/>he
 should be devoured by the wolves.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05030034"/><q>So!</q> said the chief of the
 band, <q>as he has no owner, he will come in very handy for us.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05030035"/>Whereupon, in several parties, they ransacked the cottage from
 top to bottom; and one party went out into the courtyard, where,
 as they threw aside their lances and targets, it so befell that one of
 them, not knowing where else to bestow his lance, tossed it into the
 hay, and was within an ace of killing the damsel that lay hid there,
 as likewise she of betraying her whereabouts, for the lance all but
 grazing her left breast, insomuch that the head tore her apparel, she
 doubted she was wounded, and had given a great shriek, but that,
 remembering where she was, she refrained for fear.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05030036"/>By and by the
 company cooked them a breakfast of kid's and other meat, and having
 eaten and drunken, dispersed in divers directions, as their affairs
 required, taking the girl's nag with them.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05030037"/>And when they were
 gotten some little way off, the good man asked his wife: <q>What
 became of the damsel, our guest of last night, that I have not seen
 her since we rose?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05030038"/>The good woman answered that she knew
 not where the damsel was, and went to look for her.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05030039"/>The damsel,
 discovering that the men were gone, came forth of the hay, and
 the good man, seeing her, was overjoyed that she had not fallen into
 the hands of the ruffians, and, as day was breaking, said to her:
 <q>Now that day is at hand, we will, so it like thee, escort thee to a
 castle, some five miles hence, where thou wilt be in safety; but thou
 must needs go afoot, because these villains, that are but just gone,
 have taken thy nag with them.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05030040"/>The damsel, resigning herself to
 her loss, besought them for God's sake to take her to the castle:
 whereupon they set forth, and arrived there about half tierce.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05030041"/>Now
 the castle belonged to one of the Orsini, Liello di Campo di Fiore
 by name, whose wife, as it chanced, was there. A most kindly
 and good woman she was, and, recognizing the damsel as soon as she
 saw her, gave her a hearty welcome and would fain have from her a
 particular account of how she came there.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05030042"/>So the damsel told her
 the whole story. The lady, to whom Pietro was also known, as
 being a friend of her husband, was distressed to hear of his misadventure,
 and being told where he was taken, gave him up for dead.
 So she said to the damsel: <q>Since so it is that thou knowest not
 how Pietro has fared, thou shalt stay here with me until such time
 as I may have opportunity to send thee safely back to <placeName>Rome</placeName>.</q></p><pb n="23"/><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05030043"/>Meanwhile Pietro, perched on his oak in as woeful a plight as
 might be, had espied, when he should have been in his first sleep, a
 full score of wolves, that, as they prowled, caught sight of the nag,
 and straightway were upon him on all sides.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05030044"/>The horse, as soon as he
 was ware of their approach, strained on the reins till they snapped,
 and tried to make good his escape; but, being hemmed in, was
 brought to bay, and made a long fight of it with his teeth and hooves;
 but in the end they bore him down and throttled him and forthwith
 eviscerated him, and, the whole pack falling upon him, devoured him
 to the bone before they had done with him.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05030045"/>Whereat Pietro, who
 felt that in the nag he had lost a companion and a comfort in his
 travail, was sorely dismayed, and began to think that he should never
 get out of the forest.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05030046"/>But towards dawn, he, perched there in the
 oak, almost dead with cold, looking around him as he frequently did,
 espied about a mile off a huge fire. Wherefore, as soon as 'twas
 broad day, he got down, not without trepidation, from the oak, and
 bent his steps towards the fire; and being come to it, he found,
 gathered about it, a company of shepherds, eating and making merry,
 who took pity on him and made him welcome.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05030047"/>And when he had
 broken his fast and warmed himself, he told them the mishap that
 had befallen him, and how it was that he was come there alone, and
 asked them if there was a farm or castle in those parts, whither he
 might betake him.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05030048"/>The shepherds said that about three miles away
 there was a castle belonging to Liello di Campo di Fiore, where his lady
 was then tarrying. Pietro, much comforted, requested to be guided
 thither by some of their company; whereupon two of them right
 gladly escorted him.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05030049"/>So Pietro arrived at the castle, where he found
 some that knew him; and while he was endeavouring to set on foot
 a search for the damsel in the forest, the lady summoned him to her
 presence, and he, forthwith obeying, and seeing <persName>Agnolella</persName> with her,
 was the happiest man that ever was.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05030050"/>He yearned till he all but
 swooned to go and embrace her, but refrained, for bashfulness, in the
 lady's presence. And overjoyed as he was, the joy of the damsel
 was no less.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05030051"/>The lady received him with great cheer, and though,
 when she had heard the story of his adventures from his own lips, she
 chid him not a little for having set at nought the wishes of his kinsfolk;
 yet, seeing that he was still of the same mind, and that the
 damsel was also constant, she said to herself: To what purpose <pb n="24"/>give
 I myself all this trouble? they love one another, they know
 one another; they love with equal ardour; their love is honourable,
 and I doubt not is well pleasing to God, seeing that the one has
 escaped the gallows and the other the lance, and both the wild beasts:
 wherefore be it as they would have it.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05030052"/>Then, turning to them, she
 said: <q>If 'tis your will to be joined in wedlock as man and wife,
 mine jumps with it: here shall your nuptials be solemnized and at
 Liello's charges, and for the rest I will see that your peace is made
 with your kinsfolk.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05030053"/>So in the castle the pair were wedded, Pietro
 only less blithe than <persName>Agnolella</persName>, the lady ordering the nuptials as
 honourably as might be in her mountain-home, and there they had
 most sweet joyance of the first fruits of their love.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05030054"/>So some days
 they tarried there, and then accompanied by the lady with a strong
 escort, they took horse and returned to <placeName>Rome</placeName>, where, very wroth
 though she found Pietro's kinsfolk for what he had done, the lady
 re-established solid peace between him and them; and so at <placeName>Rome</placeName>
 Pietro and <persName>Agnolella</persName> lived together to a good old age in great
 tranquillity and happiness.</p></div><pb n="25"/><!--*********************Novella 4******************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0504"><head>Novel IV</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05040001"/><!--(i)--> Ricciardo Manardi is found by Messer Lizio da Valbona

 save for sighs and a brief passage of fear mingled with shame, ran

 in <placeName>Romagna</placeName> a right worthy and courteous knight, Messer Lizio da
 Valbona by name, who was already verging upon old age, when, as it
 happened, there was born to him of his wife, Madonna Giacomina,
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05040005"/>a daughter, who, as she grew up, became the fairest and most debonair
 of all the girls of those parts, and, for that she was the only daughter
 left to them, was most dearly loved and cherished by her father and
 mother, who guarded her with most jealous care, thinking to arrange
 some great match for her.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05040006"/>Now there was frequently in Messer
 Lizio's house, and much in his company, a fine, lusty young man,
 one Ricciardo de' Manardi da Brettinoro, whom Messer Lizio and
 his wife would as little have thought of mistrusting as if he had been
 their own son: who, now and again taking note of the damsel, that
 she was very fair and graceful, and in bearing and behaviour most
 <pb n="26"/>commendable, and of marriageable age, fell vehemently in love with
 her, which love he was very careful to conceal.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05040007"/>The damsel detected
 it, however, and in like manner plunged headlong into love with
 him, to Ricciardo's no small satisfaction.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05040008"/>Again and again he was
 on the point of speaking to her, but refrained for fear; at length,
 however, he summoned up his courage, and seizing his opportunity,
 thus addressed her: <q>Caterina, I implore thee, suffer me not to
 die for love of thee.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05040009"/>Whereto the damsel forthwith responded:
 <q>Nay, God grant that it be not rather that I die for love of thee.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05040010"/>Greatly exhilarated and encouraged, Ricciardo made answer:
 <q>'Twill never be by default of mine that thou lackest aught that
 may pleasure thee; but it rests with thee to find the means to save
 thy life and mine.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05040011"/>Then said the damsel: <q>Thou seest, Ricciardo,
 how closely watched I am, insomuch that I see not how 'twere
 possible for thee to come to me; but if thou seest aught that I may
 do without dishonour, speak the word, and I will do it.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05040012"/>Ricciardo
 was silent a while, pondering many matters: then, of a sudden, he
 said: <q>Sweet my Caterina, there is but one way that I can see,
 to wit, that thou shouldst sleep either on or where thou mightst have
 access to the terrace by thy father's garden, where, so I but knew
 that thou wouldst be there at night, I would without fail contrive
 to meet thee, albeit 'tis very high.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05040013"/><q>As for my sleeping there,</q>
 replied Caterina, <q>I doubt not that it may be managed, if thou art
 sure that thou canst join me.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05040014"/>Ricciardo answered in the affirmative.
 Whereupon they exchanged a furtive kiss, and parted.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05040015"/>On the morrow, it being now towards the close of May, the
 damsel began complaining to her mother that by reason of the
 excessive heat she had not been able to get any sleep during the
 night. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05040016"/><q>Daughter,</q> said the lady, <q>what heat was there? Nay,
 there was no heat at all.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05040017"/><q>Had you said, 'to my thinking,'
 mother,</q> rejoined Caterina, <q>you would perhaps have said sooth;
 but you should bethink you how much more heat girls have in them
 than ladies that are advanced in years.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05040018"/><q>True, my daughter,</q>
 returned the lady, <q>but I cannot order that it shall be hot and cold,
 as thou perchance wouldst like; we must take the weather as we
 find it, and as the seasons provide it: perchance to-night it will be
 cooler, and thou wilt sleep better.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05040019"/><q>God grant it be so,</q> said
 Caterina, <q>but 'tis not wonted for the nights to grow cooler as the
 <pb n="27"/>summer comes on.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05040020"/><q>What then,</q> said the lady, <q>wouldst thou
 have me do?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05040021"/><q>With your leave and my father's,</q> answered
 Caterina, <q>I should like to have a little bed made up on the terrace
 by his room and over his garden, where, hearing the nightingales
 sing, and being in a much cooler place, I should sleep much better
 than in your room.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05040022"/>Whereupon: <q>Daughter, be of good cheer,</q>
 said the mother; <q>I will speak to thy father, and we will do as he
 shall decide.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05040023"/>So the lady told Messer Lizio what had passed between
 her and the damsel; but he, being old and perhaps for that reason
 a little morose, said: <q>What nightingale is this, to whose chant
 she would fain sleep? I will see to it that the cicalas shall yet lull
 her to sleep.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05040024"/>Which speech, coming to Caterina's ears, gave her
 such offence, that for anger, rather than by reason of the heat, she
 not only slept not herself that night, but suffered not her mother to
 sleep, keeping up a perpetual complaint of the great heat.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05040025"/>Wherefore
 her mother hied her in the morning to Messer Lizio, and said
 to him: <q>Sir, you hold your daughter none too dear; what difference
 can it make to you that she lie on the terrace? She has tossed
 about all night long by reason of the heat; and besides, can you
 wonder that she, girl that she is, loves to hear the nightingale sing?
 Young folk naturally affect their likes.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05040026"/>Whereto Messer Lizio
 made answer: <q>Go, make her a bed there to your liking, and set
 a curtain round it, and let her sleep there, and hear the nightingale
 sing to her heart's content.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05040027"/>Which the damsel no sooner learned,
 than she had a bed made there with intent to sleep there that same
 night; wherefore she watched until she saw Ricciardo, whom by a
 concerted sign she gave to understand what he was to do.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05040028"/>Messer
 Lizio, as soon as he had heard the damsel go to bed, locked a door
 that led from his room to the terrace, and went to sleep himself.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05040029"/>When all was quiet, Ricciardo with the help of a ladder got upon
 a wall, and standing thereon laid hold of certain toothings of another
 wall, and not without great exertion and risk, had he fallen, clambered
 up on to the terrace, where the damsel received him quietly with
 the heartiest of cheer. Many a kiss they exchanged; and then got
 them to bed, where well-nigh all night long they had solace and
 joyance of one another, and made the nightingale sing not a few
 times.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05040030"/>But, brief being the night and great their pleasure, towards
 dawn, albeit they wist it not, they fell asleep, Caterina's right arm
 <pb n="28"/>encircling Ricciardo's neck, while with her left hand she held him
 by that part of his person which your modesty, my ladies, is most
 averse to name in the company of men.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05040031"/>So, peacefully they slept,
 and were still asleep when day broke and Messer Lizio rose; and
 calling to mind that his daughter slept on the terrace, softly opened
 the door, saying to himself: Let me see what sort of night's rest
 the nightingale has afforded our Caterina?  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05040032"/>And having entered,
 he gently raised the curtain that screened the bed, and saw Ricciardo
 asleep with her and in her embrace as described, both being quite
 naked and uncovered;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05040033"/>and having taken note of Ricciardo, he went
 away, and hied him to his lady's room, and called her, saying: <q>Up,
 up, wife, come and see; for thy daughter has fancied the nightingale
 to such purpose that she has caught him, and holds him in her hand.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05040034"/><q>How can this be?</q> said the lady. <q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05040035"/>Come quickly, and thou shalt
 see,</q> replied Messer Lizio.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05040036"/>So the lady huddled on her clothes, and
 silently followed Messer Lizio, and when they were come to the
 bed, and had raised the curtain, Madonna Giacomina saw plainly
 enough how her daughter had caught, and did hold the nightingale,
 whose song she had so longed to hear.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05040037"/>Whereat the lady, deeming
 that Ricciardo had played her a cruel trick, would have cried out
 and upbraided him; but Messer Lizio said to her: <q>Wife, as thou
 valuest my love, say not a word; for in good sooth, seeing that she
 has caught him, he shall be hers.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05040038"/>Ricciardo is a gentleman and
 wealthy; an alliance with him cannot but be to our advantage: if
 he would part from me on good terms, he must first marry her, so
 that the nightingale shall prove to have been put in his own cage
 and not in that of another.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05040039"/>Whereby the lady was reassured, seeing
 that her husband took the affair so quietly, and that her daughter had
 had a good night, and was rested, and had caught the nightingale.
 So she kept silence;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05040040"/>nor had they long to wait before Ricciardo
 awoke; and, seeing that 'twas broad day, deemed that 'twas as much
 as his life was worth, and aroused Caterina, saying: <q>Alas! my
 soul, what shall we do, now that day has come and surprised me
 here?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05040041"/>Which question Messer Lizio answered by coming forward,
 and saying: <q>We shall do well.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05040042"/>At sight of him Ricciardo felt
 as if his heart were torn out of his body, and sate up in the bed, and
 said: <q>My lord, I cry you mercy for God's sake. I wot that my
 disloyalty and delinquency have merited death; wherefore deal with
 <pb n="29"/>me even as it may seem best to you: however, I pray you, if so it
 may be, to spare my life, that I die not.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05040043"/><q>Ricciardo,</q> replied
 Messer
 Lizio, <q>the love I bore thee, and the faith I reposed in thee, merited
 a better return; but still, as so it is, and youth has seduced thee into
 such a transgression, redeem thy life, and preserve my honour, by
 making Caterina thy lawful spouse, that thine, as she has been for
 this past night, she may remain for the rest of her life. In this way
 thou mayst secure my peace and thy safety; otherwise commend thy
 soul to God.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05040044"/>Pending this colloquy, Caterina let go the nightingale,
 and having covered herself, began with many a tear to implore her
 father to forgive Ricciardo, and Ricciardo to do as Messer Lizio
 required, that thereby they might securely count upon a long continuance
 of such nights of delight.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05040045"/>But there needed not much
 supplication; for, what with remorse for the wrong done, and the
 wish to make amends, and the fear of death, and the desire to escape
 it, and above all ardent love, and the craving to possess the beloved
 one, Ricciardo lost no time in making frank avowal of his readiness

 Lombards, the one ycleped Guidotto da <placeName>Cremona</placeName> and the other
 Giacomino da <placeName>Pavia</placeName>, men advanced in life, who, being soldiers, had
 spent the best part of their youth in feats of arms.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05050005"/>Now Guidotto,
 being at the point of death, and having no son or any friend or kinsman
 in whom he placed more trust than in Giacomino, left him a
 girl of about ten years, and all that he had in the world; and so,
 having given him to know not a little of his affairs, he died.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05050006"/>About
 the same time the city of <placeName>Faenza</placeName>, which had long been at war and
 in a most sorry plight, began to recover some measure of prosperity;
 and thereupon liberty to return thither on honourable terms was
 accorded to all that were so minded. Whither, accordingly, Giacomino,
 who had dwelt there aforetime, and liked the place, returned
 <pb n="31"/>with all his goods and chattels, taking with him the girl left him by
 Guidotto, whom he loved and entreated as his daughter.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05050007"/>The girl
 grew up as beautiful a maiden as was to be found in the city; and
 no less debonair and modest was she than fair. Wherefore she
 lacked not admirers; but above all two young men, both very gallant
 and of equal merit, the one Giannole di Severino, the other Minghino
 di Mingole, affected her with so ardent a passion, that, growing
 jealous, they came to hate one another with an inordinate hatred.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05050008"/>Right gladly would each have espoused her, she being now fifteen
 years old, but that his kinsmen forbade it; wherefore seeing that
 neither might have her in an honourable way, each determined to
 compass his end as best he might.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05050009"/>Now Giacomino had in his house an ancient maid, and a man, by
 name <persName>Crivello</persName>, a very pleasant and friendly sort of fellow, with whom
 Giannole grew familiar, and in due time confided to him all his love,
 praying him to further the attainment of his desire, and promising to
 reward him handsomely, if he did so.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05050010"/><persName>Crivello</persName> made answer: <q>Thou
 must know that there is but one way in which I might be of service
 to thee in this affair: I might contrive that thou shouldst be where
 she is when Giacomino is gone off to supper; but, were I to presume
 to say aught to her on thy behalf, she would never listen to me.
 This, if it please thee, I promise to do for thee, and will be as good
 as my word; and then thou canst do whatever thou mayst deem
 most expedient.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05050011"/>Giannole said that he asked no more; and so 'twas
 arranged.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05050012"/>Meanwhile Minghino on his part had made friends with the
 maid, on whom he had so wrought that she had carried several
 messages to the girl, and had gone far to kindle her to his love, and
 furthermore had promised to contrive that he should meet her when
 for any cause Giacomino should be from home in the evening.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05050013"/>And
 so it befell that no long time after these parleys, Giacomino, by
 <persName>Crivello</persName>'s management, was to go sup at the house of a friend, and
 by preconcert between <persName>Crivello</persName> and Giannole, upon signal given,
 Giannole was to come to Giacomino's house and find the door open.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05050014"/>The maid, on her part, witting nought of the understanding between
 <persName>Crivello</persName> and Giannole, let Minghino know that Giacomino would not
 sup at home, and bade him be near the house, so that he might come
 and enter it on sight of a signal from her.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05050015"/>The evening came; neither
 <pb n="32"/>of the lovers knew aught of what the other was about; but, being
 suspicious of one another, they came to take possession, each with
 his own company of armed friends. Minghino, while awaiting the
 signal, rested with his company in the house of one of his friends
 hard by the girl's house: Giannole with his company was posted a
 little farther off.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05050016"/><persName>Crivello</persName> and the maid, when Giacomino was gone,
 did each their endeavour to get the other out of the way. <persName>Crivello</persName>
 said to the maid: <q>How is it thou takest not thyself off to bed,
 but goest still hither and thither about the house?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05050017"/>And the maid
 said to <persName>Crivello</persName>: <q>Nay, but why goest thou not after thy master?
 Thou hast supped; what awaitest thou here?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05050018"/>And so, neither
      being able to make the other quit the post, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05050019"/><persName>Crivello</persName>, the hour
 concerted with Giannole being come, said to himself: What care
 I for her? If she will not keep quiet, 'tis like to be the worse for
 her. Whereupon he gave the signal, and hied him to the door,
 which he had no sooner opened, than Giannole entered with two of
 his companions, and finding the girl in the saloon, laid hands on her
 with intent to carry her off.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05050020"/>The girl struggled, and shrieked amain,
 as did also the maid. Minghino, fearing the noise, hasted to the
 spot with his companions; and, seeing that the girl was already being
 borne across the threshold, they drew their swords, and cried out in
 chorus: <q>Ah! Traitors that ye are, ye are all dead men! 'Twill
 go otherwise than ye think for. What means this force?</q> Which
 said, they fell upon them with their swords,  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05050021"/>while the neighbours,
 alarmed by the noise, came hurrying forth with lights and arms, and
 protested that 'twas an outrage, and took Minghino's part. So, after
 a prolonged struggle, Minghino wrested the girl from Giannole, and
 set her again in Giacomino's house. Nor were the combatants
 separated before the officers of the Governor of the city came up
 and arrested not a few of them; among them Minghino and Giannole
 and <persName>Crivello</persName>, whom they marched off to prison.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05050022"/>However,
 peace being restored and Giacomino returned, 'twas with no little
 chagrin that he heard of the affair; but finding upon investigation
 that the girl was in no wise culpable, he was somewhat reassured;
 and determined, lest the like should again happen, to bestow the girl
 in marriage as soon as might be.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05050023"/>On the morrow the kinsfolk of the two lovers, having learned
 the truth of the matter, and knowing what evil might ensue to the
 <pb n="33"/>captives, if Giacomino should be minded to take the course which
 he reasonably might, came and gave him good words, beseeching him
 to let the kindly feeling, the love, which they believed he bore
 to them, his suppliants, count for more with him than the wrong
 that the hare-brained gallants had done him, and on their part and
 their own offering to make any amend that he might require.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05050024"/>Giacomino, who had seen many things in his time, and lacked not
 sound sense, made answer briefly: <q>Gentlemen, were I in my own
 country, as I am in yours, I hold myself in such sort your friend
 that nought would I do in this matter, or in any other, save what
 might be agreeable to you:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05050025"/>besides which, I have the more reason
 to consider your wishes, because 'tis against you yourselves that you
 have offended, inasmuch as this damsel, whatever many folk may
 suppose, is neither of <placeName>Cremona</placeName> nor of <placeName>Pavia</placeName>, but is of <placeName>Faenza</placeName>, albeit
 neither I nor she, nor he from whom I had her, did ever wot whose
 daughter she was: wherefore, touching that you ask of me, I will
 even do just as you bid me.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05050026"/>The worthy men found it passing
 strange that the girl should be of <placeName>Faenza</placeName>; and having thanked Giacomino
 for his handsome answer, they besought him that he would be
 pleased to tell them how she had come into his hands, and how he
 knew that she was of <placeName>Faenza</placeName>.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05050027"/>To whom Giacomino replied on
 this wise: <q>A comrade and friend I had, Guidotto da <placeName>Cremona</placeName>,
 who, being at the point of death, told me that, when this city of
 <placeName>Faenza</placeName> was taken by the Emperor Frederic, he and his comrades,
 entering one of the houses during the sack, found there good store of
 booty, and never a soul save this girl,  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05050028"/>who, being two years old or
 thereabouts, greeted him as father as he came up the stairs; wherefore
 he took pity on her, and carried her with whatever else was in the
 house away with him to <placeName>Fano</placeName>; where on his deathbed he left her to
 me, charging me in due time to bestow her in marriage, and give her
 all his goods and chattels by way of dowry:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05050029"/>but, albeit she is now
 of marriageable age, I have not been able to provide her with a
 husband to my mind; though right glad should I be to do so, that
 nought like the event of yesterday may again befall me.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05050030"/>Now among the rest of those present was one Guglielmo da
 Medicina, who had been with Guidotto on that occasion, and knew
 well whose house it was that Guidotto had sacked; and seeing the
 owner there among the rest, he went up to him, and said: <q>Dost
 <pb n="34"/>hear, <persName>Bernabuccio</persName>, what Giacomino says?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05050031"/><q>Ay,</q> answered
 <persName>Bernabuccio</persName>,
 <q>and I gave the more heed thereto, for that I call to mind
 that during those disorders I lost a little daughter of just the age that
 Giacomino speaks of.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05050032"/><q>'Tis verily she then,</q> said Guglielmo,
 <q>for once when I was with Guidotto I heard him describe what house
 it was that he had sacked, and I wist that 'twas thine. Wherefore
 search thy memory if there be any sign by which thou thinkest to
 recognize her, and let her be examined that thou mayst be assured that
 she is thy daughter.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05050033"/>So <persName>Bernabuccio</persName> pondered a while, and then
 recollected that she ought to have a scar, shewing like a tiny cross,
 above her left ear, being where he had excised a tumour a little while
 before that affair: wherefore without delay he went up to Giacomino,
 who was still there, and besought him to let him go home with
 him and see the damsel.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05050034"/>Giacomino gladly did so, and no sooner was
 the girl brought into <persName>Bernabuccio</persName>'s presence, than, as he beheld her,
 'twas as if he saw the face of her mother, who was still a beautiful
 woman. However, he would not rest there, but besought Giacomino
 of his grace to permit him to lift a lock or two of hair above her left
 ear; whereto Giacomino consented.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05050035"/>So <persName>Bernabuccio</persName> approached
 her where she stood somewhat shamefast, and with his right hand
 lifted her locks, and, seeing the cross, wist that in very truth she was
 his daughter, and tenderly wept and embraced her, albeit she withstood
 him;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05050036"/>and then, turning to Giacomino, he said: <q>My
 brother, the girl is my daughter; 'twas my house that Guidotto
 sacked, and so sudden was the assault that my wife, her mother,
 forgot her, and we have always hitherto supposed, that, my house
 being burned that same day, she perished in the flames.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05050037"/>Catching
 his words, and seeing that he was advanced in years, the girl inclined
 to believe him, and impelled by some occult instinct, suffered his
 embraces, and melting, mingled her tears with his.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05050038"/><persName>Bernabuccio</persName>
 forthwith sent for her mother and her sisters and other kinswomen
 and her brothers, and having shewn her to them all, and told the
 story, after they had done her great cheer and embraced her a
 thousand times, to Giacomino's no small delight, he brought her
 home with him.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05050039"/>Which coming to the ears of the Governor of the
 city, the worthy man, knowing that Giannole, whom he had in
 ward, was <persName>Bernabuccio</persName>'s son and the girl's brother, made up his
 mind to deal leniently with Giannole: wherefore he took upon
 <pb n="35"/>himself the part of mediator in the affair, and having made peace
 between <persName>Bernabuccio</persName> and Giacomino and Giannole and Minghino,
 gave <persName>Agnesa</persName>--such was the damsel's name--to Minghino to wife, to
 the great delight of all Minghino's kinsfolk, and set at liberty not
 only Giannole and Minghino but <persName>Crivello</persName>, and the others their
 confederates in the affair.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05050040"/>Whereupon Minghino with the blithest
 of hearts wedded <persName>Agnesa</persName> with all due pomp and circumstance, and
 brought her home, where for many a year thereafter he lived with
 her in peace and prosperity.</p></div><pb n="36"/><!--*********************Novella 6******************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0506"><head>Novel VI</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05060001"/><!--(i)--> Gianni di <placeName>Procida</placeName>, being found with a damsel that he

 aforetime with other young damsels one, Restituta by name, daughter
 of one Marin Bolgaro, a gentleman of the island. Very fair was
 she, and blithe of heart, and by a young gallant, Gianni by name,
 of the neighbouring islet of <placeName>Procida</placeName>, was beloved more dearly than
 life, and in like measure returned his love.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05060005"/>Now, not to mention his
 daily resort to <placeName>Ischia</placeName> to see her, there were times not a few when
 Gianni, not being able to come by a boat, would swim across from
 <placeName>Procida</placeName> by night, that he might have sight, if of nought else, at
 least of the walls of her house.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05060006"/>And while their love burned thus
 fervently, it so befell that one summer's day, as the damsel was all
 alone on the seashore, picking her way from rock to rock, detaching,
 as she went, shells from their beds with a knife, she came to a recess
 among the rocks, where for the sake, as well of the shade as of the
 comfort afforded by a spring of most cool water that was there,
 <pb n="37"/>some Sicilian gallants, that were come from <placeName>Naples</placeName>, had put in with
 their felucca.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05060007"/>Who, having taken note of the damsel, that she was
 very fair, and that she was not yet ware of them, and was alone,
 resolved to capture her, and carry her away; nor did they fail to
 give effect to their resolve;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05060008"/>but, albeit she shrieked amain, they laid
 hands on her, and set her aboard their boat, and put to sea. Arrived
 at <placeName>Calabria</placeName>, they fell a wrangling as to whose the damsel should be,
 and in brief each claimed her for his own: wherefore, finding no
 means of coming to an agreement, and fearing that worse might
 befall them, and she bring misfortune upon them, they resolved with
 one accord to give her to Frederic, King of <placeName>Sicily</placeName>, who was then a
 young man, and took no small delight in commodities of that
 quality; and so, being come to <placeName>Palermo</placeName>, they did.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05060009"/>Marking her beauty, the King set great store by her; but as she
 was somewhat indisposed, he commanded that, till she was stronger,
 she should be lodged and tended in a very pretty villa that was in
 one of his gardens, which he called <placeName>Cuba</placeName>; and so 'twas done.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05060010"/>The
 purloining of the damsel caused no small stir in <placeName>Ischia</placeName>, more especially
 because 'twas impossible to discover by whom she had been
 carried off.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05060011"/>But Gianni, more concerned than any other, despairing
 of finding her in <placeName>Ischia</placeName>, and being apprised of the course the felucca
 had taken, equipped one himself, and put to sea, and in hot haste
 scoured the whole coast from <placeName>Minerva</placeName> to <placeName>Scalea in Calabria</placeName>, making
 everywhere diligent search for the damsel, and in <placeName>Scalea</placeName> learned
 that she had been taken by Sicilian mariners to <placeName>Palermo</placeName>.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05060012"/>Whither,
 accordingly, he hied him with all speed; and there after long search
 discovering that she had been given to the King, who kept her at
 <placeName>Cuba</placeName>, he was sore troubled, insomuch that he now scarce ventured
 to hope that he should ever set eyes on her, not to speak of having
 her for his own, again.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05060013"/>But still, holden by Love, and seeing that
 none there knew him, he sent the felucca away, and tarried there,
 and frequently passing by <placeName>Cuba</placeName>, he chanced one day to catch sight
 of her at a window, and was seen of her, to their great mutual
 satisfaction.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05060014"/>And Gianni, taking note that the place was lonely,
 made up to her, and had such speech of her as he might, and being
 taught by her after what fashion he must proceed, if he would have
 further speech of her, he departed, but not till he had made himself
 thoroughly acquainted with the configuration of the place;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05060015"/>and
 <pb n="38"/>having waited until night was come and indeed far spent, he returned
 thither, and though the ascent was such that 'twould scarce have
 afforded lodgment to a woodpecker, won his way up and entered the
 garden, where, finding a pole, he set it against the window which
 the damsel had pointed out as hers, and thereby swarmed up easily
 enough.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05060016"/>The damsel had aforetime shewn herself somewhat distant
 towards him, being careful of her honour, but now deeming it
 already lost, she had bethought her that there was none to whom
 she might more worthily give herself than to him; and reckoning
 upon inducing him to carry her off, she had made up her mind to
 gratify his every desire; and to that end had left the window open
 that his ingress might be unimpeded.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05060017"/>So, finding it open, Gianni
 softly entered, lay down beside the damsel, who was awake,  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05060018"/>and
 before they went further, opened to him all her mind, beseeching
 him most earnestly to take her thence, and carry her off. Gianni
 replied that there was nought that would give him so much pleasure,
 and that without fail, upon leaving her, he would make all needful
 arrangements for bringing her away when he next came.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05060019"/>Whereupon
 with exceeding great delight they embraced one another, and
 plucked that boon than which Love has no greater to bestow; and
 having so done divers times, they unwittingly fell asleep in one
 another's arms.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05060020"/>Now towards daybreak the King, who had been greatly charmed
 with the damsel at first sight, happened to call her to mind, and
 feeling himself fit, resolved, notwithstanding the hour, to go lie with
 her a while;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05060021"/>and so, attended by a few of his servants, he hied him
 privily to <placeName>Cuba</placeName>. Having entered the house, he passed (the door
 being softly opened) into the room in which he knew the damsel
 slept. A great blazing torch was borne before him, and so, as he
 bent his glance on the bed, he espied the damsel and Gianni lying
 asleep, naked and in one another's arms.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05060022"/>Whereat he was seized
 with a sudden and vehement passion of wrath, insomuch that, albeit
 he said never a word, he could scarce refrain from slaying both of
 them there and then with a dagger that he had with him.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05060023"/>Then,
 bethinking him that 'twere the depth of baseness in any man--not
 to say a king--to slay two naked sleepers, he mastered himself, and
 determined to do them to death in public and by fire. Wherefore,
 <pb n="39"/>turning to a single companion that he had with him, he said:
 <q>What thinkest thou of this base woman, in whom I had placed
 my hope?</q> And then he asked whether he knew the gallant, that
 had presumed to enter his house to do him such outrage and despite.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05060024"/>Whereto the other replied that he minded not ever to have seen
 him.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05060025"/>Thereupon the King hied him out of the room in a rage,
 and bade take the two lovers, naked as they were, and bind them,
 and, as soon as 'twas broad day, bring them to <placeName>Palermo</placeName>, and bind
 them back to back to a stake in the piazza, there to remain until
 tierce, that all might see them, after which they were to be burned,
 as they had deserved. And having so ordered, he went back to
 <placeName>Palermo</placeName>, and shut himself up in his room, very wroth.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05060026"/>No sooner was he gone than there came unto the two lovers folk
 not a few, who, having awakened them, did forthwith ruthlessly take
 and bind them: whereat, how they did grieve and tremble for
 their lives, and weep and bitterly bewail their fate, may readily be
 understood.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05060027"/>Pursuant to the King's commandment they were brought to
 <placeName>Palermo</placeName>, and bound to a stake in the piazza; and before their eyes
 faggots and fire were made ready to burn them at the hour appointed
 by the King.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05060028"/>Great was the concourse of the folk of <placeName>Palermo</placeName>, both
 men and women, that came to see the two lovers, the men all agog
 to feast their eyes on the damsel, whom they lauded for shapeliness
 and loveliness, and no less did the women commend the gallant,
 whom in like manner they crowded to see, for the same qualities.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05060029"/>Meanwhile the two hapless lovers, both exceeding shamefast, stood
 with bent heads bitterly bewailing their evil fortune, and momently
 expecting their death by the cruel fire.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05060030"/>So they awaited the time
 appointed by the King; but their offence being bruited abroad, the
 tidings reached the ears of Ruggieri dell' Oria, a man of peerless
 worth, and at that time the King's admiral, who, being likewise
 minded to see them, came to the place where they were bound, and
 after gazing on the damsel and finding her very fair, turned to look
 at the gallant, whom with little trouble he recognized, and drawing
 nearer to him, he asked him if he were Gianni di <placeName>Procida</placeName>.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05060031"/>Gianni
 raised his head, and recognizing the admiral, made answer: <q>My
 lord, he, of whom you speak, I was; but I am now as good as no
 more.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05060032"/>The admiral then asked him what it was that had brought
 <pb n="40"/>him to such a pass. Whereupon: <q>Love and the King's wrath,</q>
 quoth Gianni.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05060033"/>The admiral induced him to be more explicit, and
 having learned from him exactly how it had come about, was turning
 away, when Gianni called him back, saying: <q>Oh! my lord, if so
 it may be, procure me one favour of him by whose behest I thus
 stand here.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05060034"/><q>What favour?</q> demanded Ruggieri. <q>I see,</q>
 returned Gianni, <q>that die I must, and that right soon. I crave,
 then, as a favour, that, whereas this damsel and I, that have loved one
 another more dearly than life, are here set back to back, we may be
 set face to face, that I may have the consolation of gazing on her
 face as I depart.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05060035"/>Ruggieri laughed as he replied: <q>With all my
 heart. I will so order it that thou shalt see enough of her to tire or
 her.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05060036"/>He then left him and charged the executioners to do nothing
 more without further order of the King; and being assured of their
 obedience, he hied him forthwith to the King, to whom, albeit he
 found him in a wrathful mood, he spared not to speak his mind,
 saying: <q>Sire, wherein have they wronged thee, those two young
 folk, whom thou hast ordered to be burned down there in the
 piazza?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05060037"/>The King told him. Whereupon Ruggieri continued:
 <q>Their offence does indeed merit such punishment, but not at thy
 hands, and if misdeeds should not go unpunished, services should not
 go unrewarded; nay, may warrant indulgence and mercy. Knowest
 thou who they are whom thou wouldst have burned?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05060038"/>The King
 signified that he did not. Whereupon Ruggieri: <q>But I,</q> quoth
 he, <q>am minded that thou shouldst know them, to the end that thou
 mayst know with what discretion thou surrenderest thyself to a
 transport of rage.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05060039"/>The young man is the son of Landolfo di
 <placeName>Procida</placeName>, brother of Messer Gianni di <placeName>Procida</placeName>, to whom thou owest
 it that thou art lord and king of this island. The damsel is a
 daughter of Marin Bolgaro, whose might alone to-day prevents
 <placeName>Ischia</placeName> from throwing off thy yoke.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05060040"/>Moreover, these young folk
 have long been lovers, and 'tis for that the might of Love constrained
 them, and not that they would do despite to thy lordship, that they
 have committed this offence, if indeed 'tis meet to call that an
 offence which young folk do for Love's sake. Wherefore, then,
 wouldst thou do them to death, when thou shouldst rather do them
 all cheer, and honour them with lordly gifts?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05060041"/>The King gave ear
 to Ruggieri's words, and being satisfied that he spoke sooth, repented
 <pb n="41"/>him, not only of his evil purpose, but of what he had already done,
 and forthwith gave order to loose the two young folk from the
 stake, and bring them before him; and so 'twas done.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05060042"/>And having
 fully apprised himself of their case, he saw fit to make them amends
 of the wrong he had done them with honours and largess. Wherefore
 he caused them to be splendidly arrayed, and being assured that
 they were both minded to wed, he himself gave Gianni his bride,
 and loading them with rich presents, sent them well content back to
 <placeName>Ischia</placeName>, where they were welcomed with all festal cheer, and lived
 long time thereafter to their mutual solace and delight.</p></div><pb n="42"/><!--*********************Novella 7******************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0507"><head>Novel VII</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070001"/><!--(i)--> Teodoro, being enamoured of Violante, daughter of Messer

 should be told by <persName>Lauretta</persName>, who blithely thus began:</p></body></floatingText><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070003"/>Fairest ladies, what time good King Guglielmo ruled <placeName>Sicily</placeName> there
 dwelt on the island a gentleman, Messer Amerigo Abate da <placeName>Trapani</placeName>
 by name, who was well provided, as with other temporal goods, so
 also with children.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070004"/>For which cause being in need of servants, he
 took occasion of the appearance in <placeName>Trapani</placeName> waters of certain Genoese
 corsairs from the Levant, who, scouring the coast of <placeName>Armenia</placeName>,
 had captured not a few boys, to purchase of them some of these
 youngsters, supposing them to be Turks; among whom, albeit most
 shewed as mere shepherd boys, there was one, Teodoro by name,
 whose less rustic mien seemed to betoken gentle blood.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070005"/>Who,
 though still treated as a slave, was suffered to grow up in the house
 with Messer Amerigo's children, and, nature getting the better of
 circumstance, bore himself with such grace and dignity that Messer
 Amerigo gladly gave him his freedom, and still deeming him to be
 a Turk, had him baptized and named Pietro, and made him his major-domo,
 and placed much trust in him.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070006"/>Now among the other
 children that grew up in Messer Amerigo's house was his fair and
 <pb n="43"/>dainty daughter, Violante; and, as her father was in no hurry to give
 her in marriage, it so befell that she became enamoured of Pietro;
 but, for all her love and the great conceit she had of his qualities
 and conduct, she nevertheless was too shamefast to discover her
 passion to him.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070007"/>However, Love spared her the pains, for Pietro had
 cast many a furtive glance in her direction, and had grown so
 enamoured of her that 'twas never well with him except he saw her;
 but great was his fear lest any should detect his passion, for he
 deemed 'twould be the worse for him. The damsel, who was fain
 indeed of the sight of him, understood his case; and to encourage
 him dissembled not her exceeding great satisfaction.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070008"/>On which
 footing they remained a great while, neither venturing to say aught
 to the other, much as both longed to do so.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070009"/>But, while they both
 burned with a mutual flame, Fortune, as if their entanglement
 were of her preordaining, found means to banish the fear and
 hesitation that kept them tongue-tied.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070010"/>Messer Amerigo possessed, a mile or so from <placeName>Trapani</placeName>, a goodly
 estate, to which he was wont not seldom to resort with his daughter
 and other ladies by way of recreation;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070011"/>and on one of these days,
 while there they tarried with Pietro, whom they had brought with
 them, suddenly, as will sometimes happen in summer, the sky became
 overcast with black clouds, insomuch that the lady and her companions,
 lest the storm should surprise them there, set out on their return
 to <placeName>Trapani</placeName>, making all the haste they might.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070012"/>But Pietro and the
 girl being young, and sped perchance by Love no less than by fear of
 the storm, completely outstripped her mother and the other ladies;
 and when they were gotten so far ahead as to be well-nigh out of
 sight of the lady and all the rest, the thunder burst upon them peal
 upon peal, hard upon which came a fall of hail very thick and close,
 from which the lady sought shelter in the house of a husbandman.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070013"/>Pietro and the damsel, finding no more convenient refuge, betook
 them to an old, and all but ruinous, and now deserted, cottage, which,
 however, still had a bit of roof left, whereunder they both took their
 stand in such close quarters, owing to the exiguity of the shelter, that
 they perforce touched one another. Which contact was the occasion
 that they gathered somewhat more courage to disclose their love;
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070014"/>and so it was that Pietro began on this wise: <q>Now would to God
 that this hail might never cease, that so I might stay here for ever!</q><pb n="44"/><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070015"/><q>And well content were I,</q> returned the damsel. 
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070016"/>And by and by
 their hands met, not without a tender pressure, and then they fell to
 embracing and so to kissing one another, while the hail continued.
 And not to dwell on every detail, the sky was not clear before they
 had known the last degree of love's felicity, and had taken thought
 how they might secretly enjoy one another in the future.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070017"/>The
 cottage being close to the city gate, they hied them thither, as soon
 as the storm was overpast, and having there awaited the lady, returned
 home with her. Nor, using all discretion, did they fail thereafter to
 meet from time to time in secret, to their no small solace; and the
 affair went so far that the damsel conceived, whereby they were both
 not a little disconcerted; insomuch that the damsel employed many
 artifices to arrest the course of nature, but to no effect.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070018"/>Wherefore
 Pietro, being in fear of his life, saw nothing for it but flight, and told
 her so. Whereupon: <q>If thou leave me,</q> quoth she, <q>I shall
 certainly kill myself.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070019"/>Much as he loved her, Pietro answered:
 <q>Nay but, my lady, wherefore wouldst thou have me tarry here?
 Thy pregnancy will discover our offence: thou wilt be readily
 forgiven; but 'twill be my woeful lot to bear the penalty of thy sin
 and mine.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070020"/><q>Pietro,</q> returned the damsel, <q>too well will they wot
 of my offence, but be sure that, if thou confess not, none will ever
 wot of thine.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070021"/>Then quoth he: <q>Since thou givest me this
 promise, I will stay; but mind thou keep it.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070022"/>The damsel, who had done her best to keep her condition secret,
 saw at length by the increase of her bulk that 'twas impossible:
 wherefore one day most piteously bewailing herself, she made her
 avowal to her mother, and besought her to shield her from the
 consequences.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070023"/>Distressed beyond measure, the lady chid her severely,
 and then asked her how it had come to pass. The damsel, to screen
 Pietro, invented a story by which she put another complexion on the
 affair. The lady believed her, and, that her fall might not be
 discovered, took her off to one of their estates;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070024"/>where, the time of her
 delivery being come, and she, as women do in such a case, crying out
 for pain, it so befell that Messer Amerigo, whom the lady expected
 not, as indeed he was scarce ever wont, to come there, did so, having
 been out a hawking, and passing by the chamber where the damsel
 lay, marvelled to hear her cries, and forthwith entered, and asked what
 it meant.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070025"/>On sight of whom the lady rose and sorrowfully gave him
 <pb n="45"/>her daughter's version of what had befallen her. But he, less credulous
 than his wife, averred that it could not be true that she knew
 not by whom she was pregnant, and was minded to know the whole
 truth: let the damsel confess and she might regain his favour;
 otherwise she must expect no mercy and prepare for death.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070026"/>The lady did all she could to induce her husband to rest satisfied
 with what she had told him; but all to no purpose.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070027"/>Mad with rage,
 he rushed, drawn sword in hand, to his daughter's bedside (she, pending
 the parley, having given birth to a boy) and cried out: <q>Declare
 whose this infant is, or forthwith thou diest.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070028"/>Overcome by fear of
 death, the damsel broke her promise to Pietro, and made a clean
 breast of all that had passed between him and her. Whereat the
 knight, grown fell with rage, could scarce refrain from slaying her.
 However, having given vent to his wrath in such words as it
 dictated, he remounted his horse and rode to <placeName>Trapani</placeName>, and there
 before one Messer <persName>Currado</persName>, the King's lieutenant, laid information of
 the wrong done him by Pietro, in consequence whereof Pietro, who
 suspected nothing, was forthwith taken, and being put to the torture,
 confessed all.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070029"/>Some days later the lieutenant sentenced him to be
 scourged through the city, and then hanged by the neck; and Messer
 Amerigo, being minded that one and the same hour should rid the
 earth of the two lovers and their son (for to have compassed Pietro's
 death was not enough to appease his wrath), mingled poison and wine
 in a goblet, and gave it to one of his servants with a drawn sword,
 saying: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070030"/><q>Get thee with this gear to Violante, and tell her from me
 to make instant choice of one of these two deaths, either the poison
 or the steel; else, I will have her burned, as she deserves, in view of
 all the citizens; which done, thou wilt take the boy that she bore a
 few days ago, and beat his brains out against the wall, and cast his
 body for a prey to the dogs.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070031"/>Hearing the remorseless doom thus passed by the angry father
 upon both his daughter and his grandson, the servant, prompt to do
 evil rather than good, hied him thence.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070032"/>Now, as Pietro in execution of his sentence was being scourged to
 the gallows by the serjeants, 'twas so ordered by the leaders of the band
 that he passed by an inn, where were three noblemen of <placeName>Armenia</placeName>,
 sent by the king of that country as ambassadors to <placeName>Rome</placeName>, to treat
 with the Pope of matters of the highest importance, touching a
 <pb n="46"/>crusade that was to be; who, having there alighted to rest and recreate
 them for some days, had received not a few tokens of honour
 from the nobles of <placeName>Trapani</placeName>, and most of all from Messer Amerigo.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070033"/>Hearing the tramp of Pietro's escort, they came to a window to see
 what was toward;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070034"/>and one of them, an aged man, and of great
 authority, <persName>Fineo</persName> by name, looking hard at Pietro, who was stripped
 from the waist up, and had his hands bound behind his back, espied
 on his breast a great spot of scarlet, not laid on by art, but wrought
 in the skin by operation of Nature, being such as the ladies here call
 a rose.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070035"/>Which he no sooner saw, than he was reminded of a son
 that had been stolen from him by corsairs on the coast of Lazistan
 some fifteen years before, nor had he since been able to hear tidings
 of him;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070036"/>and guessing the age of the poor wretch that was being
 scourged, he set it down as about what his son's would be, were
 he living, and, what with the mark and the age, he began to
 suspect that 'twas even his son, and bethought him that, if so, he
 would scarce as yet have forgotten his name or the speech of <placeName>Armenia</placeName>.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070037"/>Wherefore, as he was within earshot he called to him: <q>Teodoro!</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070038"/>At the word Pietro raised his head: whereupon <persName>Fineo</persName>,
 speaking in <placeName>Armenia</placeName>n, asked him: <q>Whence and whose son art
 thou?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070039"/>The serjeants, that were leading him, paused in deference
 to the great man, and so Pietro answered: <q>Of <placeName>Armenia</placeName> was I,
 son of one <persName>Fineo</persName>, brought hither by folk I wot not of, when I was
 but a little child.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070040"/>Then <persName>Fineo</persName>, witting that in very truth 'twas
 the boy that he had lost, came down with his companions, weeping;
 and, all the serjeants making way, he ran to him, and embraced him,
 and doffing a mantle of richest texture that he wore, he prayed the
 captain of the band to be pleased to tarry there until he should receive
 orders to go forward, and was answered by the captain that he would
 willingly so wait.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070041"/><persName>Fineo</persName> already knew, for 'twas bruited everywhere, the cause for
 which Pietro was being led to the gallows; wherefore he straightway
 hied him with his companions and their retinue to Messer <persName>Currado</persName>,
 and said to him: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070042"/><q>Sir, this lad, whom you are sending to the
 gallows like a slave, is freeborn, and my son, and is ready to take to
 wife her whom, as 'tis said, he has deflowered; so please you, therefore,
 delay the execution until such time as it may be understood whether
 she be minded to have him for husband, lest, should she be so minded,
 <pb n="47"/>you be found to have broken the law.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070043"/>Messer <persName>Currado</persName> marvelled
 to hear that Pietro was <persName>Fineo</persName>'s son, and not without shame, albeit
 'twas not his but Fortune's fault, confessed that 'twas even as <persName>Fineo</persName>
 said: and having caused Pietro to be taken home with all speed, and
 Messer Amerigo to be brought before him, told him the whole
 matter.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070044"/>Messer Amerigo, who supposed that by this time his
 daughter and grandson must be dead, was the saddest man in the world
 to think that 'twas by his deed, witting that, were the damsel still alive,
 all might very easily be set right: however, he sent post haste to his
 daughter's abode, revoking his orders, if they were not yet carried
 out.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070045"/>The servant, whom he had earlier despatched, had laid the
 sword and poison before the damsel, and, for that she was in no hurry
 to make her choice, was giving her foul words, and endeavouring to
 constrain her thereto, when the messenger arrived; but on hearing
 the injunction laid upon him by his lord, he desisted, and went back,
 and told him how things stood.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070046"/>Whereupon Messer Amerigo, much
 relieved, hied him to <persName>Fineo</persName>, and well-nigh weeping, and excusing
 himself for what had befallen, as best he knew how, craved his
 pardon, and professed himself well content to give Teodoro, so he
 were minded to have her, his daughter to wife.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070047"/><persName>Fineo</persName> readily
 accepted his excuses, and made answer: <q>'Tis my will that my son
 espouse your daughter, and, so he will not, let thy sentence passed
 upon him be carried out.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070048"/>So <persName>Fineo</persName> and Messer Amerigo being agreed, while Teodoro still
 languished in fear of death, albeit he was glad at heart to have found
 his father, they questioned him of his will in regard of this matter.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070049"/>When he heard that, if he would, he might have Violante to
 wife, Teodoro's delight was such that he seemed to leap from hell
 to paradise, and said that, if 'twas agreeable to them all, he should
 deem it the greatest of favours.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070050"/>So they sent to the damsel to learn
 her pleasure: who, having heard how it had fared, and was now like
 to fare, with Teodoro, albeit, saddest of women, she looked for
 nought but death, began at length to give some credence to their
 words, and to recover heart a little, and answered that, were she to
 follow the bent of her desire, nought that could happen would delight
 her more than to be Teodoro's wife; but nevertheless she would do
 as her father bade her.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070051"/>So, all agreeing, the damsel was espoused with all pomp and festal
 <pb n="48"/>cheer, to the boundless delight of all the citizens, 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070052"/>and was comforted,
 and nurtured her little boy, and in no long time waxed more beautiful
 than ever before; and, her confinement being ended, she presented
 herself before <persName>Fineo</persName>, who was then about to quit <placeName>Rome</placeName> on his
 homeward journey, and did him such reverence as is due to a father.
 <persName>Fineo</persName>, mighty well pleased to have so fair a daughter-in-law, caused
 celebrate her nuptials most bravely and gaily, and received, and did
 ever thereafter entreat, her as his daughter.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05070053"/>And so he took her, not many days after the festivities were
 ended, with his son and little grandson, aboard a galley, and brought
 them to Lazistan, and there thenceforth the two lovers dwelt with

 noblemen and gentlemen not a few, among whom was a young man,
 Nastagio degli Onesti by name, who by the death of his father and one
 of his uncles inherited immense wealth.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05080005"/>Being without a wife, Nastagio,
 as 'tis the way with young men, became enamoured of a daughter
 of Messer Paolo Traversaro, a damsel of much higher birth than his,
 whose love he hoped to win by gifts and the like modes of courting,
 which,  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05080006"/>albeit they were excellent and fair and commendable, not
 only availed him not, but seemed rather to have the contrary effect,
 so harsh and ruthless and unrelenting did the beloved damsel shew
 herself towards him; for whether it was her uncommon beauty or
 <pb n="50"/>her noble lineage that puffed her up, so haughty and disdainful was
 she grown that pleasure she had none either in him or in aught that
 pleased him.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05080007"/>The burden of which disdain Nastagio found so hard
 to bear, that many a time, when he had made his moan, he longed to
 make away with himself. However he refrained therefrom, and
 many a time resolved to give her up altogether, or, if so he might, to
 hold her in despite, as she did him:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05080008"/>but 'twas all in vain, for it
 seemed as if, the more his hope dwindled, the greater grew his love.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05080009"/>And, as thus he continued, loving and spending inordinately, certain
 of his kinsfolk and friends, being apprehensive lest he should waste
 both himself and his substance, did many a time counsel and beseech
 him to depart <placeName>Ravenna</placeName>, and go tarry for a time elsewhere, that so he
 might at once cool his flame and reduce his charges.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05080010"/>For a long
 while Nastagio answered their admonitions with banter; but as they
 continued to ply him with them, he grew weary of saying no so
 often, and promised obedience. Whereupon he equipped himself as
 if for a journey to <placeName>France</placeName> or <placeName>Spain</placeName>, or other distant parts, got on
 horseback and sallied forth of <placeName>Ravenna</placeName>, accompanied by not a few of
 his friends, and being come to a place called <placeName>Chiassi</placeName>, about three
 miles from <placeName>Ravenna</placeName>,  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05080011"/>he halted, and having sent for tents and pavilions,
 told his companions that there he meant to stay, and they might go
 back to <placeName>Ravenna</placeName>.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05080012"/>So Nastagio pitched his camp, and there commenced
 to live after as fine and lordly a fashion as did ever any man,
 bidding divers of his friends from time to time to breakfast or sup
 with him, as he had been wont to do.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05080013"/>Now it so befell that about
 the beginning of May, the season being very fine, he fell a brooding
 on the cruelty of his mistress, and, that his meditations might be the
 less disturbed, he bade all his servants leave him, and sauntered slowly,
 wrapt in thought, as far as the pinewood.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05080014"/>Which he had threaded
 for a good half-mile, when, the fifth hour of the day being well-nigh
 past, yet he recking neither of food nor of aught else, 'twas as if he
 heard a woman wailing exceedingly and uttering most piercing
 shrieks: whereat, the train of his sweet melancholy being broken,
 he raised his head to see what was toward, and wondered to find himself
 in the pinewood;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05080015"/>and saw, moreover, before him running through
 a grove, close set with underwood and brambles, towards the place
 where he was, a damsel most comely, stark naked, her hair dishevelled,
 and her flesh all torn by the briers and brambles, who wept and cried
 <pb n="51"/>piteously for mercy;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05080016"/>and at her flanks he saw two mastiffs, exceeding
 great and fierce, that ran hard upon her track, and not seldom
 came up with her and bit her cruelly; and in the rear he saw, riding
 a black horse, a knight sadly accoutred, and very wrathful of mien,
 carrying a rapier in his hand, and with despiteful, blood-curdling
 words threatening her with death.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05080017"/>Whereat he was at once amazed
 and appalled, and then filled with compassion for the hapless lady,
 whereof was bred a desire to deliver her, if so he might, from such
 anguish and peril of death.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05080018"/>Wherefore, as he was unarmed, he ran
 and took in lieu of a cudgel a branch of a tree, with which he prepared
 to encounter the dogs and the knight.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05080019"/>Which the knight observing,
 called to him before he was come to close quarters, saying: <q>Hold
 off, Nastagio, leave the dogs and me alone to deal with this vile
 woman as she has deserved.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05080020"/>And, even as he spoke, the dogs
 gripped the damsel so hard on either flank that they arrested her flight,
 and the knight, being come up, dismounted. Whom Nastagio
 approached, saying: <q>I know not who thou art, that knowest me
 so well, but thus much I tell thee: 'tis a gross outrage for an armed
 knight to go about to kill a naked woman, and set his dogs upon her
 as if she were a wild beast: rest assured that I shall do all I can to
 protect her.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05080021"/>Whereupon: <q>Nastagio,</q> replied the knight, <q>of
 the same city as thou was I, and thou wast yet a little lad when I,
 Messer Guido degli Anastagi by name, being far more enamoured of
 this damsel than thou art now of her of the Traversari, was by her
 haughtiness and cruelty brought to so woeful a pass that one day
 in a fit of despair I slew myself with this rapier which thou seest
 in my hand; for which cause I am condemned to the eternal
 pains.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05080022"/>Nor was it long after my death that she, who exulted
 therein over measure, also died, and for that she repented her
 not of her cruelty and the joy she had of my sufferings, for
 which she took not blame to herself, but merit, was likewise
 condemned to the pains of hell.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05080023"/>Nor had she sooner made her
 descent, than for her pain and mine 'twas ordained, that she should
 flee before me, and that I, who so loved her, should pursue her, not as
 my beloved lady, but as my mortal enemy,  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05080024"/>and so, as often as I come
 up with her, I slay her with this same rapier with which I slew
 myself, and having ripped her up by the back, I take out that hard
 and cold heart, to which neither love nor pity had ever access, and
 <pb n="52"/>therewith her other inward parts, as thou shalt forthwith see, and
 cast them to these dogs to eat.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05080025"/>And in no long time, as the just
 and mighty God decrees, she rises even as if she had not died, and
 recommences her dolorous flight, I and the dogs pursuing her.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05080026"/>And
 it so falls out that every Friday about this hour I here come up with
 her, and slaughter her as thou shalt see; but ween not that we rest
 on other days; for there are other places in which I overtake her,
 places in which she used, or devised how she might use, me cruelly;
 on which wise, changed as thou seest from her lover into her foe, I
 am to pursue her for years as many as the months during which she
 shewed herself harsh to me.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05080027"/>Wherefore leave me to execute the
 decree of the Divine justice, and presume not to oppose that which
 thou mayst not avail to withstand.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05080028"/>Affrighted by the knight's words, insomuch that there was scarce
 a hair on his head but stood on end, Nastagio shrank back, still gazing
 on the hapless damsel, and waited all a tremble to see what the knight
 would do.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05080029"/>Nor had he long to wait; for the knight, as soon as he
 had done speaking, sprang, rapier in hand, like a mad dog upon the
 damsel, who, kneeling, while the two mastiffs gripped her tightly,
 cried him mercy; but the knight, thrusting with all his force, struck
 her between the breasts, and ran her clean through the body.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05080030"/>Thus
 stricken, the damsel fell forthwith prone on the ground sobbing and
 shrieking: whereupon the knight drew forth a knife, and having
 therewith opened her in the back, took out the heart and all the
 circumjacent parts, and threw them to the two mastiffs, who, being
 famished, forthwith devoured them. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05080031"/>And in no long time the
 damsel, as if nought thereof had happened, started to her feet, and
 took to flight towards the sea, pursued, and ever and anon bitten, by
 the dogs, while the knight, having gotten him to horse again, followed
 them as before, rapier in hand; and so fast sped they that they were
 quickly lost to Nastagio's sight.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05080032"/>Long time he stood musing on what he had seen, divided between
 pity and terror, and then it occurred to him that, as this passed
 every Friday, it might avail him not a little. So, having marked the
 place, he rejoined his servants, and in due time thereafter sent for
 some of his kinsfolk and friends, and said to them: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05080033"/><q>'Tis now a
 long while that you urge me to give up loving this lady that is no
 friend to me, and therewith make an end of my extravagant way of
 <pb n="53"/>living; and I am now ready so to do, provided you procure me one
 favour, to wit, that next Friday Messer Paolo Traversaro, and his
 wife and daughter, and all the ladies, their kinswomen, and as many
 other ladies as you may be pleased to bid, come hither to breakfast
 with me:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05080034"/>when you will see for yourselves the reason why I so
 desire.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05080035"/>A small matter this seemed to them; and so, on their
 return to <placeName>Ravenna</placeName>, they lost no time in conveying Nastagio's message
 to his intended guests: and, albeit she was hardly persuaded, yet in
 the end the damsel that Nastagio loved came with the rest.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05080036"/>Nastagio caused a lordly breakfast to be prepared, and had the
 tables set under the pines about the place where he had witnessed
 the slaughter of the cruel lady; and in ranging the ladies and
 gentlemen at table he so ordered it, that the damsel whom he loved
 was placed opposite the spot where it should be enacted.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05080037"/>The last
 course was just served, when the despairing cries of the hunted
 damsel became audible to all, to their no small amazement; and
 each asking, and none knowing, what it might import, up they all
 started intent to see what was toward; and perceived the suffering
 damsel, and the knight and the dogs, who in a trice were in their
 midst.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05080038"/>They hollaed amain to dogs and knight, and not a few
 advanced to succour the damsel: but the words of the knight, which
 were such as he had used to Nastagio, caused them to fall back,
 terror-stricken and lost in amazement.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05080039"/>And when the knight proceeded
 to do as he had done before, all the ladies that were there,
 many of whom were of kin to the suffering damsel and to the knight,
 and called to mind his love and death, wept as bitterly as if 'twere
 their own case.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05080040"/>When 'twas all over, and the lady and the knight had disappeared,
 the strange scene set those that witnessed it pondering many and
 divers matters: but among them all none was so appalled as the
 cruel damsel that Nastagio loved, who, having clearly seen and heard
 all that had passed, and being ware that it touched her more nearly
 than any other by reason of the harshness that she had ever shewn to
 Nastagio, seemed already to be fleeing from her angered lover, and
 to have the mastiffs on her flanks.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05080041"/>And so great was her terror that,
 lest a like fate should befall her, she converted her aversion into
 affection, and as soon as occasion served, which was that very night,
 sent a trusty chambermaid privily to Nastagio with a request that he
 <pb n="54"/>would be pleased to come to her, for that she was ready in all respects
 to pleasure him to the full.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05080042"/>Nastagio made answer that he was
 greatly flattered, but that he was minded with her consent to have
 his pleasure of her in an honourable way, to wit, by marrying her.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05080043"/>The damsel, who knew that none but herself was to blame that she
 was not already Nastagio's wife, made answer that she consented.
 Wherefore by her own mouth she acquainted her father and mother
 that she agreed to marry Nastagio; and, they heartily approving her
 choice,  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05080044"/>Nastagio wedded her on the ensuing Sunday, and lived
 happily with her many a year. Nor was it in her instance alone that
 this terror was productive of good: on the contrary, it so wrought
 among the ladies of <placeName>Ravenna</placeName> that they all became, and have ever
 since been, much more compliant with men's desires than they had
 been wont to be.</p></div><pb n="55"/><!--*********************Novella 9******************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0509"><head>Novel IX</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05090001"/><!--(i)--> Federigo degli Alberighi loves and is not loved in return:

 your charms to sway the gentle heart, but that you may also learn
 how upon fitting occasions to make bestowal of your guerdons of
 your own accord, instead of always waiting for the guidance of
 Fortune, which most times, not wisely, but without rule or measure,
 scatters her gifts.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05090004"/>You are then to know, that Coppo di Borghese Domenichi, a
 man that in our day was, and perchance still is, had in respect and
 great reverence in our city, being not only by reason of his noble
 lineage, but, and yet more, for manners and merit most illustrious and
 worthy of eternal renown, was in his old age not seldom wont to
 amuse himself by discoursing of things past with his neighbours and
 other folk; wherein he had not his match for accuracy and compass
 of memory and concinnity of speech.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05090005"/>Among other good stories, he
 would tell, how that there was of yore in <placeName>Florence</placeName> a gallant named
 Federigo di Messer <persName>Filippo</persName> Alberighi, who for feats of arms and
 courtesy had not his peer in <placeName>Tuscany</placeName>;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05090006"/>who, as is the common lot of
 <pb n="56"/>gentlemen, became enamoured of a lady named Monna Giovanna,
 who in her day held rank among the fairest and most elegant ladies
 of <placeName>Florence</placeName>; to gain whose love he jousted, tilted, gave entertainments,
 scattered largess, and in short set no bounds to his expenditure.
 However the lady, no less virtuous than fair, cared not
 a jot for what he did for her sake, nor yet for him.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05090007"/>Spending thus greatly beyond his means, and making nothing,
 Federigo could hardly fail to come to lack, and was at length reduced
 to such poverty that he had nothing left but a little estate, on the
 rents of which he lived very straitly, and a single falcon, the best in
 the world.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05090008"/>The estate was at <placeName>Campi</placeName>, and thither, deeming it no
 longer possible for him to live in the city as he desired, he repaired,
 more in love than ever before; and there, in complete seclusion,
 diverting himself with hawking, he bore his poverty as patiently as he
 might.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05090009"/>Now, Federigo being thus reduced to extreme poverty, it so
 happened that one day Monna Giovanna's husband, who was very
 rich, fell ill, and, seeing that he was nearing his end, made his will,
 whereby he left his estate to his son, who was now growing up, and
 in the event of his death without lawful heir named Monna Giovanna,
 whom he dearly loved, heir in his stead; and having made these
 dispositions he died.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05090010"/>Monna Giovanna, being thus left a widow, did as our ladies are
 wont, and repaired in the summer to one of her estates in the country
 which lay very near to that of Federigo.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05090011"/>And so it befell that
 the urchin began to make friends with Federigo, and to shew a
 fondness for hawks and dogs, and having seen Federigo's falcon fly
 not a few times, took a singular fancy to him, and greatly longed to
 have him for his own, but still did not dare to ask him of Federigo,
 knowing that Federigo prized him so much.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05090012"/>So the matter stood when
 by chance the boy fell sick; whereby the mother was sore distressed, for
 he was her only son, and she loved him as much as might be, insomuch
 that all day long she was beside him, and ceased not to comfort
 him, and again and again asked him if there were aught that he
 wished for, imploring him to say the word, and, if it might by any
 means be had, she would assuredly do her utmost to procure it for
 him.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05090013"/>Thus repeatedly exhorted, the boy said: <q>Mother mine, do
 but get me Federigo's falcon, and I doubt not I shall soon be well.</q><pb n="57"/><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05090014"/>Whereupon the lady was silent a while, bethinking her what she
 should do. She knew that Federigo had long loved her, and had
 never had so much as a single kind look from her: wherefore she
 said to herself: How can I send or go to beg of him this falcon,
 which by what I hear is the best that ever flew, and moreover is his
 sole comfort? And how could I be so unfeeling as to seek to deprive
 a gentleman of the one solace that is now left him?  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05090015"/>And so, albeit
 she very well knew that she might have the falcon for the asking, she
 was perplexed, and knew not what to say, and gave her son no
 answer. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05090016"/>At length, however, the love she bore the boy carried the
 day, and she made up her mind, for his contentment, come what might,
 not to send, but to go herself and fetch him the falcon. So: <q>Be of
 good cheer, my son,</q> she said, <q>and doubt not thou wilt soon be
 well; for I promise thee that the very first thing that I shall do tomorrow
 morning will be to go and fetch thee the falcon.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05090017"/>Whereat
 the child was so pleased that he began to mend that very day.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05090018"/>On the morrow the lady, as if for pleasure, hied her with another
 lady to Federigo's little house, and asked to see him.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05090019"/>'Twas still, as
 for some days past, no weather for hawking, and Federigo was in his
 garden, busy about some small matters which needed to be set right
 there. When he heard that Monna Giovanna was at the door,
 asking to see him, he was not a little surprised and pleased, and hied
 him to her with all speed.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05090020"/>As soon as she saw him, she came
 forward to meet him with womanly grace, and having received his
 respectful salutation, said to him: <q>Good morrow, Federigo,</q> and
 continued: <q>I am come to requite thee for what thou hast lost
 by loving me more than thou shouldst: which compensation is this,
 that I and this lady that accompanies me will breakfast with thee
 without ceremony this morning.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05090021"/><q>Madam,</q> Federigo replied
 with all humility, <q>I mind not ever to have lost aught by loving you,
 but rather to have been so much profited that, if I ever deserved well
 in aught, 'twas to your merit that I owed it, and to the love that I
 bore you.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05090022"/>And of a surety had I still as much to spend as I have
 spent in the past, I should not prize it so much as this visit you so
 frankly pay me, come as you are to one who can afford you but a
 sorry sort of hospitality.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05090023"/>Which said, with some confusion, he
 bade her welcome to his house, and then led her into his garden,
 where, having none else to present to her by way of companion, he
 <pb n="58"/>said: <q>Madam, as there is none other here, this good woman, wife
 of this husbandman, will bear you company, while I go to have the
 table set.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05090024"/>Now, albeit his poverty was extreme, yet he had not
 known as yet how sore was the need to which his extravagance had
 reduced him; but this morning 'twas brought home to him, for that
 he could find nought wherewith to do honour to the lady, for love
 of whom he had done the honours of his house to men without
 number:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05090025"/>wherefore, distressed beyond measure, and inwardly cursing
 his evil fortune, he sped hither and thither like one beside himself,
 but never a coin found he, nor yet aught to pledge. Meanwhile it
 grew late, and sorely he longed that the lady might not leave his
 house altogether unhonoured, and yet to crave help of his own
 husbandman was more than his pride could brook. In these desperate
 straits his glance happened to fall on his brave falcon on his perch in
 his little parlour. And so, as a last resource, he took him, and finding
 him plump, deemed that he would make a dish meet for such a
 lady.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05090026"/>Wherefore, without thinking twice about it, he wrung the
 bird's neck, and caused his maid forthwith pluck him and set him on
 a spit, and roast him carefully; and having still some spotless table-linen,
 he had the table laid therewith, and with a cheerful countenance
 hied him back to his lady in the garden, and told her that such
 breakfast as he could give her was ready.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05090027"/>So the lady and her companion
 rose and came to table, and there, with Federigo, who waited on
 them most faithfully, ate the brave falcon, knowing not what they ate.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05090028"/>When they were risen from table, and had dallied a while in gay
 converse with him, the lady deemed it time to tell the reason of her
 visit: wherefore, graciously addressing Federigo, thus began she:
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05090029"/><q>Federigo, by what thou rememberest of thy past life and my virtue,
 which, perchance, thou hast deemed harshness and cruelty, I doubt
 not thou must marvel at my presumption, when thou hearest the
 main purpose of my visit; but if thou hadst sons, or hadst had them, so
 that thou mightest know the full force of the love that is borne them,
 I should make no doubt that thou wouldst hold me in part excused.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05090030"/>Nor, having a son, may I, for that thou hast none, claim exemption
 from the laws to which all other mothers are subject, and, being thus
 bound to own their sway, I must, though fain were I not, and
 though 'tis neither meet nor right, crave of thee that which I know
 thou dost of all things and with justice prize most highly,  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05090031"/>seeing
 <pb n="59"/>that this extremity of thy adverse fortune has left thee nought else
 wherewith to delight, divert and console thee; which gift is no other
 than thy falcon, on which my boy has so set his heart that, if I
 bring him it not, I fear lest he grow so much worse of the malady
 that he has, that thereby it may come to pass that I lose him.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05090032"/>And
 so, not for the love which thou dost bear me, and which may nowise
 bind thee, but for that nobleness of temper, whereof in courtesy
 more conspicuously than in aught else thou hast given proof, I implore
 thee that thou be pleased to give me the bird, that thereby
 I may say that I have kept my son alive, and thus made him for
 aye thy debtor.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05090033"/>No sooner had Federigo apprehended what the lady wanted,
 than, for grief that 'twas not in his power to serve her, because he
 had given her the falcon to eat, he fell a weeping in her presence,
 before he could so much as utter a word. At first the lady supposed
 that 'twas only because he was loath to part with the brave falcon
 that he wept, and as good as made up her mind that he would refuse
 her: however, she awaited with patience Federigo's answer, which
 was on this wise: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05090034"/><q>Madam, since it pleased God that I should set
 my affections upon you there have been matters not a few, in which
 to my sorrow I have deemed Fortune adverse to me; but they have
 all been trifles in comparison of the trick that she now plays me:
 the which I shall never forgive her, seeing that you are come here to
 my poor house, where, while I was rich, you deigned not to come,
 and ask a trifling favour of me, which she has put it out of my
 power to grant: how 'tis so, I will briefly tell you.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05090035"/>When I learned
 that you, of your grace, were minded to breakfast with me, having
 respect to your high dignity and desert, I deemed it due and seemly
 that in your honour I should regale you, to the best of my power,
 with fare of a more excellent quality than is commonly set before
 others;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05090036"/>and, calling to mind the falcon which you now ask of me,
 and his excellence, I judged him meet food for you, and so you have
 had him roasted on the trencher this morning; and well indeed I
 thought I had bestowed him; but, as now I see that you would fain
 have had him in another guise, so mortified am I that I am not able
 to serve you, that I doubt I shall never know peace of mind more.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05090037"/>In witness whereof he had the feathers and feet and beak of the
 bird brought in and laid before her.</p><pb n="60"/><p> The first thing the lady did, when she had heard Federigo's
 story, and seen the relics of the bird, was to chide him that he had
 killed so fine a falcon to furnish a woman with a breakfast; after
 which the magnanimity of her host, which poverty had been and
 was powerless to impair, elicited no small share of inward commendation.
 Then, frustrate of her hope of possessing the falcon, and
 doubting of her son's recovery, she took her leave with the heaviest
 of hearts, and hied her back to the boy:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05090038"/>who, whether for fretting,
 that he might not have the falcon, or by the unaided energy of his
 disorder, departed this life not many days after, to the exceeding
 great grief of his mother.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05090039"/>For a while she would do nought but
 weep and bitterly bewail herself; but being still young, and left very
 wealthy, she was often urged by her brothers to marry again, and
 though she would rather have not done so, yet being importuned,
 and remembering Federigo's high desert, and the magnificent generosity
 with which he had finally killed his falcon to do her honour,
 she said to her brothers: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05090040"/><q>Gladly, with your consent, would I
 remain a widow, but if you will not be satisfied except I take a
 husband, rest assured that none other will I ever take save Federigo
 degli Alberighi.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05090041"/>Whereupon her brothers derided her, saying:
 <q>Foolish woman, what is't thou sayst? How shouldst thou want
 Federigo, who has not a thing in the world?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05090042"/>To whom she
 answered: <q>My brothers, well wot I that 'tis as you say; but I
 had rather have a man without wealth than wealth without a man.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05090043"/>The brothers, perceiving that her mind was made up, and knowing
 Federigo for a good man and true, poor though he was, gave her to
 him with all her wealth. And so Federigo, being mated with such
 a wife, and one that he had so much loved, and being very wealthy
 to boot, lived happily, keeping more exact accounts, to the end of his
 days.</p></div><pb n="61"/><!--*********************Novella 10******************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0510"><head>Novel X</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100001"/><!--(i)--> Pietro di Vinciolo goes from home to sup: his wife brings

 that he was a man, and supposing him to have the desires which men
 have and ought to have; and had I not deemed him to be a man,
 I should never have married him.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100011"/>He knew me to be a woman:
 why then took he me to wife, if women were not to his mind?
 'Tis not to be endured.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100012"/>Had I not been minded to live in the
 world, I had become a nun; and being minded there to live, as I
 am, if I am to wait until I have pleasure or solace of him, I shall
 wait perchance until I am old; and then, too late, I shall bethink
 me to my sorrow that I have wasted my youth; and as to the way
 in which I should seek its proper solace I need no better teacher and
 guide than him, who finds his delight where I should find mine,  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100013"/>and
 finds it to his own condemnation, whereas in me 'twere commendable.
 'Tis but the laws that I shall set at nought, whereas he sets
 both them and Nature herself at nought.</p><pb n="63"/><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100014"/>So the good lady reasoned, and peradventure more than once;
 and then, casting about how she might privily compass her end, she
 made friends with an old beldam, that shewed as a veritable Santa
 Verdiana, foster-mother of vipers, who was ever to be seen going to
 pardonings with a parcel of paternosters in her hand, and talked of
 nothing but the lives of the holy Fathers, and the wounds of St.
 Francis, and was generally reputed a saint;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100015"/>to whom in due time
 she opened her whole mind. <q>My daughter,</q> replied the beldam,
 <q>God, who knows all things, knows that thou wilt do very rightly
 indeed: were it for no other reason, 'twould be meet for thee and
 every other young woman so to do, that the heyday of youth be not
 wasted; for there is no grief like that of knowing that it has been
 wasted.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100016"/>And what the devil are we women fit for when we are old
 --except to pore over the cinders on the hearth? The which if any
 know, and may attest it, 'tis I, who, now that I am old, call to mind
 the time that I let slip from me, not without most sore and bitter
 and fruitless regret:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100017"/>and albeit 'twas not all wasted, for I would not
 have thee think that I was entirely without sense, yet I did not
 make the best use of it: whereof when I bethink me, and that I am
 now, even as thou seest me, such a hag that never a spark of fire may
 I hope to get from any, God knows how I rue it.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100018"/>Now with men
 'tis otherwise: they are born meet for a thousand uses, not for this
 alone; and the more part of them are of much greater consequence
 in old age than in youth: but women are fit for nought but this,
 and 'tis but for that they bear children that they are cherished.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100019"/>Whereof, if not otherwise, thou mayst assure thyself, if thou do but
 consider that we are ever ready for it; which is not the case with
 men; besides which, one woman will tire out many men without
 being herself tired out. Seeing then that 'tis for this we are born, I
 tell thee again that thou wilt do very rightly to give thy husband thy
 loaf for his cake, that in thy old age thy soul may have no cause of
 complaint against thy flesh.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100020"/>Every one has just as much of this life
 as he appropriates: and this is especially true of women, whom
 therefore it behoves, much more than men, to seize the moment as
 it flies: indeed, as thou mayst see for thyself, when we grow old
 neither husband, nor any other man will spare us a glance; but, on
 the contrary, they banish us to the kitchen, there to tell stories to the
 cat, and to count the pots and pans;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100021"/>or, worse, they make rhymes
 <pb n="64"/>about us: 'To the damsel dainty bits; to the beldam ague-fits;' and
 such-like catches.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100022"/>But to make no more words about it, I tell thee
 at once that there is no person in the world to whom thou couldst
 open thy mind with more advantage than to me; for there is no
 gentleman so fine but I dare speak my mind to him, nor any so harsh
 and forbidding but I know well how to soften him and fashion him
 to my will.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100023"/>Tell me only what thou wouldst have, and leave the
 rest to me: but one word more: I pray thee to have me in kindly
 remembrance, for that I am poor; and thou shalt henceforth go
 shares with me in all my indulgences and every paternoster that I
 say, that God may make thereof light and tapers for thy dead:</q>
 wherewith she ended.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100024"/>So the lady came to an understanding with the beldam, that, as
 soon as she set eyes on a boy that often came along that street, and
 of whom the lady gave her a particular description, she would know
 what she was to do: and thereupon the lady gave her a chunk
 of salt meat, and bade her God-speed.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100025"/>The beldam before long
 smuggled into the lady's chamber the boy of whom she had spoken,
 and not long after another, such being the humour of the lady, who,
 standing in perpetual dread of her husband, was disposed, in this
 particular,
 to make the most of her opportunities.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100026"/>And one of these
 days, her husband being to sup in the evening with a friend named
 <persName>Ercolano</persName>, the lady bade the beldam bring her a boy as pretty and
 dainty as was to be found in <placeName>Perugia</placeName>; and so the beldam forthwith
 did.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100027"/>But the lady and the boy being set at table to sup, lo, Pietro's
 voice was heard at the door, bidding open to him.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100028"/>Whereupon the
 lady gave herself up for dead; but being fain, if she might, to screen
 the boy, and knowing not where else to convey or conceal him,
 bestowed him under a hen-coop that stood in a veranda hard by the
 chamber in which they were supping, and threw over it a sorry
 mattress that she had that day emptied of its straw; which done she
 hastened to open the door to her husband;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100029"/>saying to him as he
 entered: <q>You have gulped your supper mighty quickly to-night.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100030"/>Whereto Pietro replied: <q>We have not so much as tasted it.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100031"/><q>How so?</q> enquired the lady. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100032"/><q>I will tell thee,</q> said Pietro.
 <q>No sooner were we set at table, <persName>Ercolano</persName>, his wife, and I, than we
 heard a sneeze close to us, to which, though 'twas repeated, we paid
 no heed; but as the sneezer continued to sneeze a third, a fourth, a
 <pb n="65"/>fifth, and many another time to boot, we all began to wonder,  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100033"/>and
 <persName>Ercolano</persName>, who was somewhat out of humour with his wife, because
 she had kept us a long time at the door before she opened it, burst
 out in a sort of rage with:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100034"/>'What means this? Who is't that
 thus sneezes?' and made off to a stair hard by, beneath which and
 close to its foot was a wooden closet, of the sort which, when folk are
 furnishing their houses, they commonly cause to be placed there, to
 stow things in upon occasion.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100035"/>And as it seemed to him that the
 sneezing proceeded thence, he undid the wicket, and no sooner had
 he opened it than out flew never so strong a stench of brimstone;
 albeit we had already been saluted by a whiff of it, and complained
 thereof, but had been put off by the lady with:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100036"/>''Tis but that a
 while ago I bleached my veils with brimstone, having sprinkled it
 on a dish, that they might catch its fumes, which dish I then placed
 under the stair, so that it still smells a little.'</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100037"/><q>However the door being now, as I have said, open, and the
 smoke somewhat less dense, <persName>Ercolano</persName>, peering in, espied the fellow
 that had sneezed, and who still kept sneezing, being thereto constrained
 by the pungency of the brimstone. And for all he sneezed,
 yet was he by this time so well-nigh choked with the brimstone that
 he was like neither to sneeze nor to do aught else again.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100038"/>As soon as
 he caught sight of him, <persName>Ercolano</persName> bawled out: 'Now see I, Madam,
 why it was that a while ago, when we came here, we were kept
 waiting so long at the gate before 'twas opened; but woe be???ide me
 for the rest of my days, if I pay you not out.'  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100039"/>Whereupon the lady,
 perceiving that her offence was discovered, ventured no excuse, but
 fled from the table, whither I know not.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100040"/><persName>Ercolano</persName>, ignoring his
 wife's flight, bade the sneezer again and again to come forth; but
 he, being by this time fairly spent, budged not an inch for aught that
 <persName>Ercolano</persName> said. Wherefore <persName>Ercolano</persName> caught him by one of his feet,
 and dragged him forth, and ran off for a knife with intent to kill
 him;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100041"/>but I, standing in fear of the Signory on my own account, got
 up and would not suffer him to kill the fellow or do him any hurt,
 and for his better protection raised the alarm, whereby some of the
 neighbours came up and took the lad, more dead than alive, and bore
 him off, I know not whither. However, our supper being thus rudely
 interrupted, not only have not gulped it, but I have not so much as
 tasted it, as I said before.</q></p><pb n="66"/><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100042"/>Her husband's story shewed his wife that there were other ladies
 as knowing as she, albeit misfortune might sometimes overtake them;
 and gladly would she have spoken out in defence of <persName>Ercolano</persName>'s wife,
 but, thinking that, by censuring another's sin, she would secure more
 scope for her own, she launched out on this wise: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100043"/><q>Fine doings
 indeed, a right virtuous and saintly lady she must be: here is the
 loyalty of an honest woman, and one to whom I had lief have confessed,
 so spiritual I deemed her; and the worst of it is that, being
 no longer young, she sets a rare example to those that are so.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100044"/>Curses
 on the hour that she came into the world: curses upon her that she
 make not away with herself, basest, most faithless of women that she
 must needs be, the reproach of her sex, the opprobrium of all the
 ladies of this city, to cast aside all regard for her honour, her marriage
 vow, her reputation before the world, and, lost to all sense of shame,
 to scruple not to bring disgrace upon a man so worthy, a citizen so
 honourable, a husband by whom she was so well treated, ay, and
 upon herself to boot!  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100045"/>By my hope of salvation no mercy should be
 shewn to such women; they should pay the penalty with their lives;
 to the fire with them while they yet live, and let them be burned to
 ashes.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100046"/>Then, calling to mind the lover that she had close at hand
 in the hen-coop, she fell to coaxing Pietro to get him to bed, for the
 hour grew late. Pietro, who was more set on eating than sleeping,
 only asked whether there was aught he might have by way of supper.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100047"/><q>Supper, forsooth!</q> replied the lady. <q>Ay, of course 'tis our way
 to make much of supper when thou art not at home. As if I were
 <persName>Ercolano</persName>'s wife! Now, wherefore tarry longer? Go, get thy night's
 rest: 'twere far better for thee.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100048"/>Now so it was that some of Pietro's husbandmen had come to
 the house that evening with divers things from the farm, and had
 put up their asses in a stable that adjoined the veranda, but had
 neglected to water them; and one of the asses being exceeding
 thirsty, got his head out of the halter and broke loose from the stable,
 and went about nosing everything, if haply he might come by water:
 whereby he came upon the hen-coop, beneath which was the boy;
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100049"/>who, being constrained to stand on all fours, had the fingers of one
 hand somewhat protruding from under the hen-coop; and so as luck
 or rather ill-luck would have it, the ass trod on them; whereat, being
 sorely hurt, he set up a great howling,  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100050"/>much to the surprise of Pietro,
 <pb n="67"/>who perceived that 'twas within his house. So forth he came, and
 hearing the boy still moaning and groaning, for the ass still kept his
 hoof hard down on the fingers, called out: <q>Who is there?</q> and
 ran to the hen-coop and raised it, and espied the fellow, who, besides
 the pain that the crushing of his fingers by the ass's hoof occasioned
 him, trembled in every limb for fear that Pietro should do him a
 mischief.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100051"/>He was one that Pietro had long been after for his foul
 purposes: so Pietro, recognizing him, asked him: <q>What dost
 thou here?</q> The boy making no answer, save to beseech him for
 the love of God to do him no hurt,  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100052"/>Pietro continued: <q>Get up,
 have no fear that I shall hurt thee; but tell me: How, and for
 what cause comest thou to be here?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100053"/>The boy then confessed
 everything. Whereupon Pietro, as elated by the discovery as his wife
 was distressed, took him by the hand; and led him into the room
 where the lady in the extremity of terror awaited him;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100054"/>and, having
 seated himself directly in front of her, said: <q>'Twas but a moment
 ago that thou didst curse <persName>Ercolano</persName>'s wife, and averred that she ought
 to be burned, and that she was the reproach of your sex: why saidst
 thou not, of thyself? Or, if thou wast not minded to accuse thyself,
 how hadst thou the effrontery to censure her, knowing that thou
 hadst done even as she? Verily 'twas for no other reason than that
 ye are all fashioned thus, and study to cover your own misdeeds with
 the delinquencies of others: would that fire might fall from heaven
 and burn you all, brood of iniquity that ye are!</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100055"/>The lady, marking that in the first flush of his wrath he had
 given her nothing worse than hard words, and discerning, as she
 thought, that he was secretly overjoyed to hold so beautiful a boy by
 the hand, took heart of grace and said: <q>I doubt not indeed that
 thou wouldst be well pleased that fire should fall from heaven and
 devour us all, seeing that thou art as fond of us as a dog is of the
 stick, though by the Holy Rood thou wilt be disappointed;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100056"/>but I
 would fain have a little argument with thee, to know whereof thou
 complainest. Well indeed were it with me, didst thou but place me
 on an equality with <persName>Ercolano</persName>'s wife, who is an old sanctimonious
 hypocrite, and has of him all that she wants, and is cherished by him
 as a wife should be: but that is not my case.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100057"/>For, granted that
 thou givest me garments and shoes to my mind, thou knowest how
 otherwise ill bested I am, and how long it is since last thou didst lie
 <pb n="68"/>with me; and far liefer had I go barefoot and in rags, and have thy
 benevolence abed, than have all that I have, and be treated as thou
 dost treat me.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100058"/>Understand me, Pietro, be reasonable; consider that
 I am a woman like other women, with the like craving; whereof
 if thou deny me the gratification, 'tis no blame to me that I seek it
 elsewhere; and at least I do thee so much honour as not forgather
 with stable-boys or scurvy knaves.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100059"/>Pietro perceived that she was like to continue in this vein the
 whole night: wherefore, indifferent as he was to her, he said:
 <q>Now, Madam, no more of this; in the matter of which thou
 speakest I will content thee; but of thy great courtesy let us have
 something to eat by way of supper; for, methinks, the boy, as well
 as I, has not yet supped.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100060"/><q>Ay, true enough,</q> said the lady, <q>he
 has not supped; for we were but just sitting down to table to sup,
 when, beshrew thee, thou madest thy appearance.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100061"/><q>Go then,</q>
 said Pietro, <q>get us some supper; and by and by I will arrange this
 affair in such a way that thou shalt have no more cause of complaint.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100062"/>The lady, perceiving that her husband was now tranquil, rose, and
 soon had the table laid again and spread with the supper which she
 had ready; and so they made a jolly meal of it, the caitiff husband,
 the lady and the boy.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100063"/>What after supper Pietro devised for their
 mutual satisfaction has slipped from my memory. But so much as
 this I know, that on the morrow as he wended his way to the piazza,
 the boy would have been puzzled to say, whether of the twain, the
 wife or the husband, had had the most of his company during the
 night.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05100064"/>But this I would say to you, dear my ladies, that whoso
 gives you tit, why, just give him tat; and if you cannot do it at
 once, why, bear it in mind until you can, that even as the ass gives,
 so he may receive.</p></div><!--*****************************Conclusion*****************************--><div type="conclusion" corresp="d05conclu"><head>Conclusion</head><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p05970001"/><persName>Dioneo</persName>'s story, whereat the ladies laughed the less for shamefastness

then bade him cause <persName>Licisca</persName> and <persName>Tindaro</persName> to come thither forthwith: so they came, and the
queen enquired of them the cause of the uproar. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06980007"/><persName>Tindaro</persName> was about to make
answer, when <persName>Licisca</persName>, who was somewhat advanced in years, and disposed to give herself
airs, and heated to the strife of words, turned to <persName>Tindaro</persName>,
and scowling upon him said: <q>Unmannerly varlet that makest bold to speak before me;
leave me to tell the story.</q> Then, turning to the queen, she said: 
      <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06980008"/><q>Madam, this
fellow would fain instruct me as to Sicofante's wife, and--neither more or less--as if I
had not known her well--would have me believe that, the first night that Sicofante lay
with her, 'twas by force and not without effusion of blood that Master Yard made his way
into Dusky Hill; which I deny, averring that he met with no resistance, but, on the
contrary, with a hearty welcome on the part of the garrison. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06980009"/>And such a
numskull is he as fondly to believe that the girls are so simple as to let slip their
opportunities, while they wait on the caprice of father or brothers, who six times out of
	seven delay to marry them for three or four years after they should. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06980010"/>Ay, ay indeed,
doubtless they were well advised to tarry so long! Christ's faith! I should know the truth
of what I swear; there is never a woman in my neighbour-hood whose husband had her
virginity; and well I know how many and what manner of tricks our married dames play their
husbands; and yet this booby would fain teach me to know women as if I were but born
yesterday.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06980011"/>While <persName>Licisca</persName> thus spoke, the ladies laughed till all their teeth were ready to start
from their heads. Six times at least the queen bade her be silent: but all in vain; she
      halted not till she had said all that she had a mind to. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06980012"/>When she had done, the queen
turned with a smile to <persName>Dioneo</persName> saying: <q>This is a question for thee to deal with, <persName>Dioneo</persName>;
so hold thyself in readiness to give final judgment upon it, when our stories are
ended.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06980013"/><q>Madam,</q> replied <persName>Dioneo</persName> forthwith, <q>I give judgment without

that <persName>Tindaro</persName> is a fool.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06980014"/>Whereupon <persName>Licisca</persName> burst out laughing, and turning
to <persName>Tindaro</persName>: <q>Now did I not tell thee so?</q> quoth she. <q>Begone in

God's name: dost think to know more than I, thou that art but a <pb n="73"/>sucking babe?
Thank God, I have not lived for nothing, not I.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06980015"/>And had not the queen sternly bade her be silent, and make no more

her. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06980016"/>So <persName>Licisca</persName> and <persName>Tindaro</persName> having withdrawn, the queen charged <persName>Filomena</persName> to

not a few of you may have
 seen or heard of, whose name--for such high
qualities merit not
 oblivion--<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06010006"/>was Madonna Oretta, her husband being Messer
Geri Spina.
 Now this lady, happening to be, as we are, in the country,
moving
 from place to place for pleasure with a company of ladies and
gentlemen,
 whom she had entertained the day before at breakfast at her

house, and the place of their next sojourn, whither they were to go
 <pb n="75"/>afoot, being some considerable distance off, one of the gentlemen
of
 the company said to her: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06010007"/><q>Madonna Oretta, so please you, I will

 do
so; and I shall deem it the greatest of favours.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06010009"/>Whereupon the

gentleman, who perhaps was no better master of his weapon than of
 his
story, began a tale, which in itself was indeed excellent, but which,
 by
repeating the same word three, four or six times, and now and
 again
harking back, and saying: <q>I said not well</q>; and erring
 not seldom in
the names, setting one in place of another, he utterly
 spoiled; besides
which, his mode of delivery accorded very ill with
 the character of the
persons and incidents: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06010010"/>insomuch that Madonna
 Oretta, as she listened, did
oft sweat, and was like to faint, as if she
 were ill and at the point of
death. And being at length able to bear
 no more of it, witting that the
gentleman had got into a mess and
 was not like to get out of it, she said
pleasantly to him: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06010011"/><q>Sir, this

of apprehension than

 took it in all good and gay humour. So, leaving

 which he had begun, and so mishandled, he addressed
himself to tell

	<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06020007"/>Whereof how in a trifling matter <persName>Cisti</persName>, the baker, gave proof, restoring

Messer Geri Spina
 stood very high in favour and honour, having sent divers
of his
 courtiers to <placeName>Florence</placeName> as ambassadors to treat of certain matters of
great
 moment, and they being lodged in Messer Geri's house, where he

treated with them of the said affairs of the Pope, 'twas, for some
 reason
or another, the wont of Messer Geri and the ambassadors of
 the Pope to
pass almost every morning by <placeName>Santa Maria Ughi</placeName>, where
 <persName>Cisti</persName>, the baker, had
his bakehouse, and plied his craft in person.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06020009"/>Now, albeit Fortune had
allotted him a very humble occupation, she
 had nevertheless prospered him
therein to such a degree that he was
 grown most wealthy, and without ever
aspiring to change it for
 another, lived in most magnificent style, having
among his other good
 things a cellar of the best wines, white and red,
that were to be found
 in <placeName>Florence</placeName>, or the country parts; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06020010"/>and marking
Messer Geri and the
 ambassadors of the Pope pass every morning by his
door, he bethought
 him that, as 'twas very hot, 'twould be a very
courteous thing to give
 them to drink of his good wine; but comparing his
rank with that
 of Messer Geri, he deemed it unseemly to presume to invite
him,
 and cast about how he might lead Messer Geri to invite himself.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06020011"/>So,
wearing always the whitest of doublets and a spotless apron, that
 denoted
rather the miller than the baker, he let bring, every morning
 about the
hour that he expected Messer Geri and the ambassadors to
 pass by his door,
a spick-and-span bucket of fresh and cool spring
 water, and a small
Bolognese flagon of his good white wine, and two
 beakers that shone like
silver, so bright were they: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06020012"/>and there down
 he sat him, as they came by,
and after hawking once or twice, fell a
 drinking his wine with such gusto
that 'twould have raised a thirst
 in a corpse. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06020013"/>Which Messer Geri having
observed on two successive
 mornings, said on the third: <q>What is't,
<persName>Cisti</persName>? Is't good?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06020014"/>Whereupon <persName>Cisti</persName> jumped up, and answered: <q>Ay, Sir,
good it is;
 but in what degree I might by no means make you understand,
unless
 you tasted it.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06020015"/>Messer Geri, in whom either the heat of the
weather,
 or unwonted fatigue, or, perchance, the gusto with which he had

seen <persName>Cisti</persName> drink, had bred a thirst, turned to the ambassadors and
 said
with a smile: <q>Gentlemen, 'twere well to test the quality of
 this worthy
man's wine: it may be such that we shall not repent
 us.</q> And so in a
body they came up to where <persName>Cisti</persName> stood; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06020016"/>who,
 having caused a goodly bench
to be brought out of the bakehouse,
 <pb n="78"/>bade them be seated, and to
their servants, who were now coming
 forward to wash the beakers, said:
<q>Stand back, comrades, and
 leave this office to me, for I know as well
how to serve wine as to
 bake bread; and expect not to taste a drop
yourselves.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06020017"/>Which said,
 he washed four fine new beakers with his own
hands, and having
 sent for a small flagon of his good wine, he heedfully
filled the
 beakers, and presented them to Messer Geri and his companions;

who deemed the wine the best that they had drunk for a great while.
 So
Messer Geri, having praised the wine not a little, came there to
 drink
every morning with the ambassadors as long as they tarried
 with
him.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06020018"/>Now when the ambassadors had received their<!--(i)-->
congè<!--(/i)-->, and were
 about to depart, Messer Geri
gave a grand banquet, to which he bade
 some of the most honourable of the
citizens, and also <persName>Cisti</persName>, who could
 by no means be induced to come.
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06020019"/>However, Messer Geri bade one
 of his servants go fetch a flask of <persName>Cisti</persName>'s
wine, and serve half a beaker
 thereof to each guest at the first course.
The servant, somewhat
 offended, perhaps, that he had not been suffered to
taste any of the
 wine, took with him a large flask, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06020020"/>which <persName>Cisti</persName> no sooner
saw, than:
 <q>Son,</q> quoth he, <q>Messer Geri does not send thee to
me</q>: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06020021"/>and
 often as the servant affirmed that he did, he could get no
other answer:
 wherewith he was fain at last to return to Messer Geri.
<q>Go, get
 thee back,</q> said Messer Geri, <q>and tell him that I do send
thee
 to him, and if he answers thee so again, ask him, to whom then
 I
send thee.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06020022"/>So the servant came back, and said: <q><persName>Cisti</persName>, Messer
 Geri
does, for sure, send me to thee.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06020023"/><q>Son,</q> answered <persName>Cisti</persName>,

<q>Messer

then,</q> said
 the servant, <q>does he send me?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06020025"/><q>To <placeName>Arno</placeName>,</q>
returned <persName>Cisti</persName>.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06020026"/>Which being reported by the servant to Messer Geri, the
eyes of
 his mind were straightway opened, and: <q>Let me see,</q> quoth
he
 to the servant, <q>what flask it is thou takest there.</q> And when he

had seen it: <q><persName>Cisti</persName> says sooth,</q> he added; and having sharply
 chidden
him, he caused him take with him a suitable flask, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06020027"/>which
 when <persName>Cisti</persName> saw:
<q>Now know I,</q> quoth he, <q>that 'tis indeed Messer
 Geri that sends
thee to me,</q> and blithely filled it. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06020028"/>And having
 replenished the rundlet
that same day with wine of the same quality,
 he had it carried with due
care to Messer Geri's house, and followed
 after himself; where finding
Messer Geri he said: <q>I would not
 <pb n="79"/>have you think, Sir, that I
was appalled by the great flask your servant

'twas but that I thought you had forgotten

set great

 Messer Dego della Ratta by name, being King Ruberto's

 Now Dego being very goodly of person, and inordinately fond of women, it so befell that

 said to her: <q>Nonna, what thinkest thou of this gentleman? That

 resented as

slept off his wrath, got
 up still swelling therewith, and ordered his
horses, mounted <persName>Chichibio</persName>
 on a hackney, and saying to him: <q>We shall

a place where there
 was much water, beside which there were always cranes

 about dawn. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06040015"/><persName>Chichibio</persName>, observing that <persName>Currado</persName>'s ire was
unabated,
 and knowing not how to bolster up his lie, rode by <persName>Currado</persName>'s
side
 in a state of the utmost trepidation, and would gladly, had he been
able, have taken to flight; but, as hemight not, he glanced, now
 ahead,
now aback, now aside, and saw everywhere nought but cranes
 standing on two
feet. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06040016"/>However, as they approached the river, the
 very first thing they saw
upon the bank was a round dozen of cranes
 standing each and all on one
foot, as is their wont, when asleep.
 Which <persName>Chichibio</persName> presently pointed out
to <persName>Currado</persName>, saying: <q>Now
 may you see well enough, Sir, that 'tis true as
I said yesternight, that
 <pb n="84"/>the crane has but one thigh and one

<q>Wait,</q> quoth he, <q>and I

 having drawn a little nigher to them, he
ejaculated, <q>Ohio!</q> Which
 caused the cranes to bring each the other
foot to the ground, and,
 after hopping a step or two, to take to flight.
<persName>Currado</persName> then turned
 to <persName>Chichibio</persName>, saying: <q>How now, rogue? art satisfied
that the

beside
 himself with fear, made answer: <q>Ay, Sir; but you cried not,

 popped its

so much relished, that, all his wrath changed to jollity

 of whom I purpose for a brief while to discourse. The one, Messer Forese da Rabatta by
 name, was short and deformed of person and withal flat-cheeked and flat-nosed, insomuch
 that never a <persName>Baroncio</persName><note>The name of a Florentine family famous for the extraordinary
 ugliness of its men: whereby it came to pass that any grotesque or extremely ugly man was

 yet so conversant was this man with the laws, that by not a few of those well able to
 form an opinion he was reputed a veritable storehouse of civil jurisprudence. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06050005"/>The other, whose name was Giotto, was of so excellent a wit that, let
 Nature, mother of all, operant ever by continual revolution of the heavens, fashion what
 she would, he with his style and pen and pencil would depict its like on such wise that
 it shewed not as its like, but rather as the thing itself, insomuch that the visual sense
 of men did often err in regard thereof, mistaking for real that which was but
 painted. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06050006"/>Wherefore, having brought back to light that art which
 had for many ages lain buried beneath the blunders of those who painted rather to delight
 the eyes of the ignorant than to satisfy the intelligence of the wise, he may deservedly
 be called one of the lights that compose the glory of <pb n="86"/><placeName>Florence</placeName>, and the more
 so, the more lowly was the spirit in which he won that glory, who, albeit he was, while
 he yet lived, the master of others, yet did ever refuse to be called their
 master. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06050007"/>And this title that he rejected adorned him with a
 lustre the more splendid in proportion to the avidity with which it was usurped by those
 who were less knowing than he, or were his pupils. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06050008"/>But for all
 the exceeding greatness of his art, yet in no particular had he the advantage of Messer
 Forese either in form or in feature. But to come to the story: 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06050009"/>'Twas in <placeName>Mugello</placeName> that Messer Forese, as likewise Giotto, had his
 country-seat, whence returning from a sojourn that he had made there during the summer
 vacation of the courts, and being, as it chanced, mounted on a poor jade of a draught
 horse, he fell in with the said Giotto, who was also on his way back to <placeName>Florence</placeName> after a
 like sojourn on his own estate, and was neither better mounted, nor in any other wise
 better equipped, than Messer Forese. And so, being both old men, they jogged on together
 at a slow pace: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06050010"/>and being surprised by a sudden shower, such as
 we frequently see fall in summer, they presently sought shelter in the house of a
 husbandman that was known to each of them, and was their friend. 
    <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06050011"/>But after a while, as the rain gave no sign of ceasing, and they had a
 mind to be at <placeName>Florence</placeName> that same day, they borrowed of the husbandman two old cloaks of
 Romagnole cloth, and two hats much the worse for age (there being no better to be had),
 and resumed their journey.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06050012"/>Whereon they had not proceeded far,
 when, taking note that they were soaked through and through, and liberally splashed with
 the mud cast up by their nags' hooves (circumstances which are not of a kind to add to
 one's dignity), they, after long silence, the sky beginning to brighten a little, began
 to converse. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06050013"/>And Messer Forese, as he rode and hearkened to
 Giotto, who was an excellent talker, surveyed him sideways, and from head to foot, and
 all over, and seeing him in all points in so sorry and scurvy a trim, and recking nought
 of his own appearance, broke into a laugh and said: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06050014"/><q>Giotto,

 you, he gave you credit for knowing the A B C.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06050016"/>Which

since there dwelt in our city a young man,
 Michele Scalza by name, the
pleasantest and merriest fellow in the
 world, and the best furnished with
quaint stories: for which reason
 the Florentine youth set great store on
having him with them when
 they forgathered in company. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06060005"/>Now it so befell
that one day, he
 being with a party of them at <placeName>Mont' Ughi</placeName>, they fell a
disputing
 together on this wise; to wit, who were the best gentlemen and
of
 the longest descent in <placeName>Florence</placeName>. One said, the Uberti, another, the
<persName>Lamberti</persName>, or some other family, according to the predilection of the
speaker. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06060006"/>Whereat Scalza began to smile, and said: <q>Now out

 ye say. The best

 and the <placeName>Maremma</placeName> (let

who had looked for somewhat else from
 him, said derisively: <q>Thou dost
but jest with us; as if we did not
 know the <persName>Baronci</persName> as well as thou!</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06060008"/>Quoth Scalza: <q>By the Gospels
 I jest not, but speak sooth; and if there
is any of you will wager a
 supper to be given to the winner and six good
fellows whom he
 shall choose, I will gladly do the like, and--what is
more--I will
 abide by the decision of such one of you as you may
choose.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06060009"/>Then
 said one of them whose name was Neri Mannini: <q>I am
ready to
 adventure this supper;</q> and so they agreed together that Piero
di
 Fiorentino, in whose house they were, should be judge, and hied them
to him followed by all the rest, eager to see Scalza lose, and triumph
 in
his discomfiture, and told Piero all that had been said. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06060010"/>Piero, who
 was a
young man of sound sense, heard what Neri had to say; and
 then turning to
Scalza: <q>And how,</q> quoth he, <q>mayst thou make
 good what thou
averrest?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06060011"/><q>I will demonstrate it,</q> returned
 Scalza, <q>by
reasoning so cogent that not only you, but he that denies
 it shall
acknowledge that I say sooth. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06060012"/>You know, and so they were
 saying but now,
that the longer men's descent, the better is their
 gentility, and I say
that the <persName>Baronci</persName> are of longer descent, and thus
 better gentlemen than any
other men. If, then, I prove to you that
 they are of longer descent than
any other men, without a doubt the
 victory in this dispute will rest with
me. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06060013"/>Now you must know that
 when God made the <persName>Baronci</persName>, He was but a novice
in His art, of
 which, when He made the rest of mankind, He was already
master.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06060014"/>And to assure yourself that herein I say sooth, you have but to
consider
 the <persName>Baronci</persName>, how they differ from the rest of mankind, who all
have faces well composed and duly proportioned, whereas of the
 <persName>Baronci</persName> you
will see one with a face very long and narrow, another
 with a face
inordinately broad, one with a very long nose, another
 with a short one,
one with a protruding and upturned chin, and
 great jaws like an ass's; and
again there will be one that has one eye
 larger than its fellow, or set on
a lower plane; so that their faces
 resemble those that children make when
they begin to learn to draw.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06060015"/>Whereby, as I said, 'tis plainly manifest
that, when God made them,
 He was but novice in His art; and so they are of
longer descent
 than the rest of mankind, and by consequence better
gentlemen.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06060016"/>By which entertaining argument Piero, the judge, and Neri
who had
 wagered the supper, and all the rest, calling to mind the
<persName>Baronci</persName>'s
 <pb n="89"/>ugliness, were so tickled, that they fell a laughing,
and averred that
 Scalza was in the right, and that he had won the wager,

 without a doubt the <persName>Baronci</persName> were the best gentlemen, and of the

no less censurable
 than harsh, which, making no distinction between the
wife
 whom her husband took in adultery with her lover, and the woman
found pleasuring a stranger for money, condemned both alike to be
 burned.
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06070005"/>While this statute was in force, it befell that a gentle-woman,
 fair and
beyond measure enamoured, Madonna Filippa by
 name, was by her husband,
Rinaldo de' Pugliesi, found in her own
 chamber one night in the arms of
Lazzarino de' Guazzagliotri, a

she loved even as

 needful to prove her
guilt, he took no further counsel; but, as soon
 as 'twas day, he charged
the lady and had her summoned. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06070009"/>Like
 most ladies that are veritably
enamoured, the lady was of a high
 courage; and, though not a few of her
friends and kinsfolk sought
 to dissuade her, she resolved to appear to the
summons, having liefer
 die bravely confessing the truth than basely flee
and for defiance of
 the law live in exile, and shew herself unworthy of
such a lover as
 had had her in his arms that night. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06070010"/>And so, attended by
many ladies
 and gentlemen, who all exhorted her to deny the charge, she
came
 before the Podestà, and with a composed air and unfaltering
voice
 asked whereof he would interrogate her. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06070011"/>The Podestà,
surveying her,
 and taking note of her extraordinary beauty, and exquisite
manners,
 and the high courage that her words evinced, was touched with
compassion
 for her, fearing she might make some admission, by reason
whereof, to save his honour, he must needs do her to death. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06070012"/>But
 still, as
he could not refrain from examining her of that which was
 laid to her
charge, he said: <q>Madam, here, as you see, is your
 husband, Rinaldo, who
prefers a charge against you, alleging that he
 has taken you in adultery,
and so he demands that, pursuant to a
 statute which is in force here, I
punish you with death: but this I
 may not do, except you confess;
wherefore be very careful what you
 answer, and tell me if what your
husband alleges against you be true.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06070013"/>The lady, no wise dismayed, and
in a tone not a little jocund, thus
 made answer: <q>True it is, Sir, that
Rinaldo is my husband, and
 that last night he found me in the arms of
Lazzarino, in whose arms
 for the whole-hearted love that I bear him I have
ofttimes lain; nor
 shall I ever deny it; but, as well I wot you know, the
laws ought
 to be common and enacted with the common consent of all that
they
 affect; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06070014"/>which conditions are wanting to this law, inasmuch as it
binds only us poor women, in whom to be liberal is much less reprehensible
than it were in men; and furthermore the consent of no

not had, but--so much as asked before 'twas
 made; for which reasons it
justly deserves to be called a bad law.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06070015"/>However, if in scathe of my body

but, I pray you, go not

 enjoyment of myself.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06070016"/>Whereto Rinaldo,
without awaiting
 the Podestà's question, forthwith answered, that
assuredly the lady
 had ever granted him all that he had asked of her for
his gratification.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06070017"/><q>Then,</q> promptly continued the lady, <q>if he has

to
 bestow it on a gentleman that loves me more dearly than himself,

in
 our city customs excellent and commendable not a few, whereof today
not one is left to us, thanks to the greed which, growing with
 the wealth
of our folk, has banished them all from among us. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06090005"/>One
 of which customs was
that in divers quarters of <placeName>Florence</placeName> the gentlemen
 that there resided would
assemble together in companies of a
 limited number, taking care to include
therein only such as might
 conveniently bear the expenses, and to-day one,
another to-morrow,
 each in his turn for a day, would entertain the rest of
the company;
 and so they would not seldom do honour to gentlemen from
distant
 parts when they visited the city, and also to their
fellow-citizens;
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06090006"/>and in like manner they would meet together at least once
a year all
 in the same trim, and on the most notable days would ride
together
 through the city, and now and again they would tilt together,
more
 especially on the greater feasts, or when the city was rejoiced by
tidings of victory or some other glad event. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06090007"/>Among which companies
 was one
of which Messer Betto Brunelleschi was the leading
 spirit, into which
Messer Betto and his comrades had striven hard
 <pb n="96"/>to bring Guido,
son of Cavalcante de' Cavalcanti, and not without
 reason, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06090008"/>inasmuch as,
besides being one of the best logicians in the
 world, and an excellent
natural philosopher (qualities of which the
 company made no great
account), he was without a peer for gallantry
 and courtesy and excellence
of discourse and aptitude for all matters
 which he might set his mind to,
and that belonged to a gentleman;
 and therewithal he was very rich, and,
when he deemed
 any worthy of honour, knew how to bestow it to the
uttermost.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06090009"/>But, as Messer Betto had never been able to gain him over, he
and his comrades supposed that 'twas because Guido, being addicted
 to
speculation, was thereby estranged from men. And, for that he
 was somewhat
inclined to the opinion of the Epicureans, the vulgar
 averred that these
speculations of his had no other scope than to
 prove that God did not
exist. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06090010"/>Now one day it so befell that, Guido
 being come, as was not seldom
his wont, from <placeName>Or San Michele</placeName> by
 the Corso degli Adimari as far as San
Giovanni, around which were
 then the great tombs of marble that are to-day
in <placeName>Santa Reparata</placeName>,
 besides other tombs not a few, and Guido being between
the columns
 of porphyry, that are there, and the tombs and the door of
San
 Giovanni, which was locked, Messer Betto and his company came
 riding
on to the piazza of <placeName>Santa Reparata</placeName>, and seeing him among the
 tombs, said:
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06090011"/><q>Go we and flout him.</q> So they set spurs to their
 horses, and making
a mock onset, were upon him almost before he
 saw them. Whereupon:
<q>Guido,</q> they began, <q>thou wilt be
 none of our company; but, lo
now, when thou hast proved that
 God does not exist, what wilt thou have
achieved?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06090012"/>Guido, seeing
 that he was surrounded, presently answered:
<q>Gentlemen, you
 may say to me what you please in your own house.</q>
Thereupon he
 laid his hand on one of the great tombs, and being very
nimble,
 vaulted over it, and so evaded them, and went his way, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06090013"/>while they
remained gazing in one another's faces, and some said that he had
 taken
leave of his wits, and that his answer was but nought, seeing
 that the
ground on which they stood was common to them with the
 rest of the
citizens, and among them Guido himself. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06090014"/>But Messer
 Betto, turning to them:
<q>Nay but,</q> quoth he, <q>'tis ye that have
 taken leave of your wits,
if ye have not understood him; for meetly
 and in few words he has given us
never so shrewd a reprimand;
 seeing that, if you consider it well, these
tombs are the houses of the
 <pb n="97"/>dead, that are laid and tarry
therein; which he calls our house, to
 shew us that we, and all other
simple, unlettered men, are, in comparison
 of him and the rest of the
learned, in sorrier case than dead
 men, and so being here, we are in our
own house.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06090015"/>Then none was
 there but understood Guido's meaning and was
abashed, insomuch
 that they flouted him no more, and thenceforth reputed
Messer Betto
 a gentleman of a subtle and discerning wit.</p></div><pb n="98"/><!--*********************************Novella 10***************************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0610"><head>Novel X</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100001"/><!--(i)-->Fra Cipolla promises to shew certain country-folk a

aforetime people of rank and wealth. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100006"/>Thither, for that there he
 found good
pasture, 'twas long the wont of one of the Friars of St.
 Antony to resort
once every year, to collect the alms that fools gave
 them. Fra
Cipolla<note>Onion.</note>--so hight the friar--met with a hearty
welcome,
 no less, perchance, by reason of his name than for other cause,
the
 onions produced in that district being famous throughout <placeName>Tuscany</placeName>.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100007"/>He
was little of person, red-haired, jolly-visaged, and the very best
 of good
fellows; and therewithal, though learning he had none, he
 <pb n="99"/>was
so excellent and ready a speaker that whoso knew him not would
 not only
have esteemed him a great rhetorician, but would have
 pronounced him Tully
himself or, perchance, Quintilian; and in all
 the country-side there was
scarce a soul to whom he was not either
 gossip or friend or lover. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100008"/>Being
thus wont from time to time to
 visit <placeName>Certaldo</placeName>, the friar came there once
upon a time in the month
 of August, and on a Sunday morning, all the good
folk of the
 neighbouring farms being come to mass in the parish church, he
took
 occasion to come forward and say: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100009"/><q>Ladies and gentlemen, you
 wot
'tis your custom to send year by year to the poor of Baron
 Master St.
Antony somewhat of your wheat and oats, more or less,
 according to the
ability and the devoutness of each, that blessed St.
 Antony may save your
oxen and asses and pigs and sheep from harm;
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100010"/>and you are also accustomed,
and especially those whose names are
 on the books of our confraternity, to
pay your trifling annual dues.
 To collect which offerings, I am hither
sent by my superior, to wit,
 Master Abbot; wherefore, with the blessing of
God, after none,
 when you hear the bells ring, you will come out of the
church to
 the place where in the usual way I shall deliver you my sermon,
and
 you will kiss the cross; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100011"/>and therewithal, knowing, as I do, that you
are one and all most devoted to Baron Master St. Antony, I will by
 way of
especial grace shew you a most holy and goodly relic, which
 I brought
myself from the <placeName>Holy Land</placeName> overseas, which is none other
 than one of the
feathers of the Angel Gabriel, which he left behind
 him in the room of the
Virgin Mary, when he came to make her
 the annunciation in <placeName>Nazareth</placeName>.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100012"/>And having said thus much, he
 ceased, and went on with the mass. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100013"/>Now among
the many that
 were in the church, while Fra Cipolla made this speech, were
two
 very wily young wags, the one Giovanni del Bragoniera by name,
 the
other Biagio Pizzini; who, albeit they were on the best of
 terms with Fra
Cipolla and much in his company, had a sly laugh
 together over the relic,
and resolved to make game of him and his
 feather. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100014"/>So, having learned that
Fra Cipolla was to breakfast that
 morning in the town with one of his
friends, as soon as they knew
 that he was at table, down they hied them
into the street, and to the
 inn where the friar lodged, having complotted
that Biagio should
 keep the friar's servant in play, while Giovanni made
search among
 the friar's goods and chattels for this feather, whatever it
might be,
 <pb n="100"/>to carry it off, that they might see how the friar
would afterwards
 explain the matter to the people. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100015"/>Now Fra Cipolla had for
servant
 one Guccio,<note>Diminutive of Arriguccio.</note> whom some called
by way of
 addition Balena,<note>Whale.</note> others
Imbratta,<note>Filth.</note> others again Porco,<note>Hog.</note> and who
was
 such a rascallion that
 sure it is that Lippo Topo<note>The works of
this painter seem to be
 lost.</note> himself never painted his like.
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100016"/>Concerning
 whom Fra Cipolla would ofttimes make merry with his
 familiars,
saying: <q>My servant has nine qualities, any one of
 which in Solomon,
Aristotle, or Seneca, would have been enough to
 spoil all their virtue,
wisdom and holiness. Consider, then, what
 sort of a man he must be that
has these nine qualities, and yet never
 a spark of either virtue or wisdom
or holiness.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100017"/>And being asked
 upon divers occasions what these nine
qualities might be, he strung
 them together in rhyme, and answered: <q>I
will tell you. Lazy
 and uncleanly and a liar he is, Negligent, disobedient
and foulmouthed,
 iwis, And reckless and witless and mannerless: and
therewithal
 he has some other petty vices, which 'twere best to pass
over.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100018"/>And the most amusing thing about him is, that, wherever he goes, he
is for taking a wife and renting a house, and on the strength of a big,
black, greasy beard he deems himself so very handsome a fellow and
seductive, that he takes all the women that see him to be in love
 with
him, and, if he were left alone, he would slip his girdle and run
 after
them all. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100019"/>True it is that he is of great use to me, for that,
 be any
minded to speak with me never so secretly, he must still have
 his share of
the audience; and, if perchance aught is demanded of
 me, such is his fear
lest I should be at a loss what answer to make,
 that he presently replies,
ay or no, as he deems meet.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100020"/>Now, when he left this knave at the
inn, Fra Cipolla had strictly
 enjoined him on no account to suffer any one
to touch aught of his,
 and least of all his wallet, because it contained
the holy things.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100021"/>But Guccio Imbratta, who was fonder of the kitchen than
any
 nightingale of the green boughs, and most particularly if he espied
there a maid, and in the host's kitchen had caught sight of a coarse
 fat
woman, short and misshapen, with a pair of breasts that shewed
 as two
buckets of muck and a face that might have belonged to one
 of the <persName>Baronci</persName>,
all reeking with sweat and grease and smoke, left
 Fra Cipolla's room and
all his things to take care of themselves, and
 <pb n="101"/>like a vulture
swooping down upon the carrion, was in the kitchen
 in a trice. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100022"/>Where,
though 'twas August, he sat him down by the
 fire, and fell a gossiping
with Nuta--such was the maid's name--and
 told her that he was a gentleman
by procuration,<note>One of the humorous
 ineptitudes of which Boccaccio is
fond.</note> and had more
 florins than could be reckoned, besides those
that he had to give
 away, which were rather more than less, and that he
could do and
 say such things as never were or might be seen or heard
forever, good
 Lord! and a day. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100023"/>And all heedless of his cowl, which had as
much
 grease upon it as would have furnished forth the caldron of
Altopascio,<note>An
 abbey near Lucca famous for its doles of
broth.</note>
 and of his rent and patched doublet, inlaid with filth about
the neck
 and under the armpits, and so stained that it shewed hues more
various than ever did silk from Tartary or the Indies, and of his
 shoes
that were all to pieces, and of his hose that were all in tatters,
 he told
her in a tone that would have become the Sieur de Châtillon,
 that he
was minded to rehabit her and put her in trim, and raise her
 from her
abject condition, and place her where, though she would
 not have much to
call her own, at any rate she would have hope of
 better things, with much
more to the like effect; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100024"/>which professions,
 though made with every
appearance of good will, proved, like most
 of his schemes, insubstantial
as air, and came to nothing.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100025"/>Finding Guccio Porco thus occupied with
Nuta, the two young
 men gleefully accounted their work half done, and,
none gainsaying
 them, entered Fra Cipolla's room, which was open, and lit
at once
 upon the wallet, in which was the feather. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100026"/>The wallet opened,
they
 found, wrapt up in many folds of taffeta, a little casket, on
opening
 which they discovered one of the tail-feathers of a parrot, which
they
 deemed must be that which the friar had promised to shew the good
folk of <placeName>Certaldo</placeName>. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100027"/>And in sooth he might well have so imposed upon
 them,
for in those days the luxuries of <placeName>Egypt</placeName> had scarce been
 introduced into
<placeName>Tuscany</placeName>, though they have since been brought over
 in prodigious abundance,
to the grave hurt of all <placeName>Italy</placeName>. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100028"/>And though
 some conversance with them
there was, yet in those parts folk knew
 next to nothing of them; but,
adhering to the honest, simple ways of
 their forefathers, had not seen,
nay for the most part had not so much
 as heard tell of, a
parrot.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100029"/>So the young men, having found the feather, took it out
with
 <pb n="102"/>great glee; and looking around for something to replace
it, they
 espied in a corner of the room some pieces of coal, wherewith
they
 filled the casket; which they then closed, and having set the room
in order exactly as they had found it, they quitted it unperceived,
 and
hied them merrily off with the feather, and posted themselves
 where they
might hear what Fra Cipolla would say when he found
 the coals in its
stead. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100030"/>Mass said, the simple folk that were in the
 church went home with
the tidings that the feather of the Angel
 Gabriel was to be seen after
none; and this goodman telling his
 neighbour, and that goodwife her
gossip, by the time every one had
 breakfasted, the town could scarce hold
the multitude of men and
 women that flocked thither all agog to see this
feather.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100031"/>Fra Cipolla, having made a hearty breakfast and had a
little nap,
 got up shortly after none, and marking the great concourse of
country-folk that were come to see the feather, sent word to Guccio
Imbratta to go up there with the bells, and bring with him the
 wallet.
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100032"/>Guccio, though 'twas with difficulty that he tore himself
 away from the
kitchen and Nuta, hied him up with the things
 required; and though, when
he got up, he was winded, for he was
 corpulent with drinking nought but
water, he did Fra Cipolla's
 bidding by going to the church door and
ringing the bells amain.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100033"/>When all the people were gathered about the door,
Fra Cipolla, all
 unwitting that aught of his was missing, began his
sermon, and after
 much said in glorification of himself, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100034"/>caused the
confiteor to be recited
 with great solemnity, and two torches to be lit by
way of preliminary
 to the shewing of the feather of the Angel Gabriel: he
then bared
 his head, carefully unfolded the taffeta, and took out the
casket,
 which, after a few prefatory words in praise and laudation of the
Angel Gabriel and his relic, he opened. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100035"/>When he saw that it contained
nought but coals, he did not suspect Guccio Balena of playing
 the trick,
for he knew that he was not clever enough, nor did he
 curse him, that his
carelessness had allowed another to play it, but he
 inly imprecated
himself, that he had committed his things to the
 keeping of one whom he
knew to be <q>negligent and disobedient,
 reckless and witless.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100036"/>Nevertheless, he changed not colour, but
 with face and hands upturned to
heaven, he said in a voice that all
 might hear: <q>O God, blessed be Thy
might for ever and ever.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100037"/>Then, closing the casket, and turning to the
people: <q>Ladies and
 <pb n="103"/>gentlemen,</q> he said, <q>you are to
know, that when I was yet a very
 young man, I was sent by my superior into
those parts where the

 the Privileges of <placeName>Porcellana</placeName>, which, though they cost
nothing to seal,
 are of much more use to others than to us. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100038"/>On which

 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100040"/>and

 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100043"/>However, not being able to find that whereof I was in quest,
because

 a small phial a bit of the sound of the bells of Solomon's
temple, and
 <pb n="105"/>this feather of the Angel Gabriel, whereof I have
told you, and one
 of the pattens of San Gherardo da Villa Magna, which,
not long ago,
 I gave at <placeName>Florence</placeName> to Gherardo di Bonsi, who holds him in
prodigious
 veneration. He also gave me some of the coals with which the
most blessed martyr, St. Lawrence, was roasted. All which things
 I
devoutly brought thence, and have them all safe. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100048"/>True it is that
 my
superior has not hitherto permitted me to shew them, until he
 should be
certified that they are genuine. However, now that this
 is avouched by
certain miracles wrought by them, of which we have
 tidings by letter from
the Patriarch, he has given me leave to shew
 them. But, fearing to trust
them to another, I always carry them
 with me; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100049"/>and to tell you the truth I
carry the feather of the Angel
 Gabriel, lest it should get spoiled, in a
casket, and the coals, with
 which St. Lawrence was roasted, in another
casket; which caskets
 are so like the one to the other, that not seldom I
mistake one for
 the other, which has befallen me on this occasion; for,
whereas I
 thought to have brought with me the casket wherein is the
feather,
 I have brought instead that which contains the coals. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100050"/>Nor deem l
this a mischance; nay, methinks, 'tis by interposition of God, and
 that He
Himself put the casket of coals in my hand, for I mind me
 that the feast
of St. Lawrence falls but two days hence. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100051"/>Wherefore
 God, being minded that
by shewing you the coals, with which he
 was roasted, I should rekindle in
your souls the devotion that you
 ought to feel towards him, guided my
hand, not to the feather which
 I meant to take, but to the blessed coals
that were extinguished by
 the humours that exuded from that most holy
body. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100052"/>And so,
 blessed children, bare your heads and devoutly draw nigh to
see
 them. But first of all I would have you know, that whoso has the
 sign
of the cross made upon him with these coals, may live secure for
 the whole
of the ensuing year, that fire shall not touch him, that he
 feel it
not.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100053"/>Having so said, the friar, chanting a hymn in praise of
St.
 Lawrence, opened the casket, and shewed the coals. Whereon the

foolish crowd gazed a while in awe and reverent wonder, and then
 came
pressing forward in a mighty throng about Fra Cipolla with
 offerings
beyond their wont, each and all praying him to touch them
 with the coals.
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100054"/>Wherefore Fra Cipolla took the coals in his hand,
 and set about making on
their white blouses, and on their doublets,
 <pb n="106"/>and on the veils
of the women crosses as big as might be, averring
 the while that whatever
the coals might thus lose would be made
 good to them again in the casket,
as he had often proved. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100055"/>On this
 wise, to his exceeding great profit, he
marked all the folk of <placeName>Certaldo</placeName>
 with the cross, and, thanks to his ready
wit and resource, had his
 laugh at those, who by robbing him of the
feather thought to make
 a laughing-stock of him. They, indeed, being among
his hearers,
 and marking his novel expedient, and how voluble he was, and
what
 a long story he made of it, laughed till they thought their jaws
would break; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06100056"/>and, when the congregation was dispersed, they went
 up to
him, and never so merrily told him what they had done, and
 returned him
his feather; which next year proved no less lucrative
 to him than that day
the coals had been.</p></div><div type="conclusion" corresp="d06conclu"><head>Conclusion</head><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06970001"/>Immense was the delight and
diversion which this story afforded
 to all the company alike, and great
and general was the laughter over
 Fra Cipolla, and more especially at his
pilgrimage, and the relics, as
 well those that he had but seen as those
that he had brought back
 with him. Which being ended, the queen, taking
note that therewith
 the close of her sovereignty was come, stood up, took
off the
 crown, and set it on <persName>Dioneo</persName>'s head, saying with a laugh: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06970002"/><q>'Tis
time, <persName>Dioneo</persName>, that thou prove the weight of the burden of having
 ladies to
govern and guide. Be thou king then; and let thy rule
 be such that, when
'tis ended, we may have cause to commend it.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06970003"/><persName>Dioneo</persName> took the crown,
and laughingly answered: <q>Kings worthier
 far than I you may well have
seen many a time ere now--I speak
 of the kings in chess; but let me have
of you that obedience which
 is due to a true king, and of a surety I will
give you to taste of that
 solace, without which perfection of joy there
may not be in any
 festivity. But enough of this: I will govern as best I
may.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06970004"/>Then,
 as was the wont, he sent for the seneschal, and gave him
particular
 instruction how to order matters during the term of his
sovereignty,
 which done, he said: <q>Noble ladies, such and so diverse has
been
 our discourse of the ways of men and their various fortunes, that
but for the visit that we had a while ago from Madam <persName>Licisca</persName>, who
 by what
she said has furnished me with matter of discourse for
 to-morrow, I doubt
I had been not a little put to it to find a theme.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06970005"/>You heard how she said
that there was not a woman in her neighbourhood
 whose husband had her
virginity; adding that well she knew
 <pb n="107"/>how many and what manner
of tricks they, after marriage, played
 their husbands. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06970006"/>The first count we
may well leave to the girls
 whom it concerns; the second, methinks, should
prove a diverting
 topic: wherefore I ordain that, taking our cue from
Madam <persName>Licisca</persName>,
 we discourse to-morrow of the tricks that, either for love
or for their
 deliverance from peril, ladies have heretofore played their
husbands,
 and whether they were by the said husbands detected or no.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06970007"/>To
 discourse of such a topic some of the ladies deemed unmeet for them,
and besought the king to find another theme. But the king made
 answer:
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06970008"/><q>Ladies, what manner of theme I have prescribed I know
 as well as you,
nor was I to be diverted from prescribing it by that
 which you now think
to declare unto me, for I wot the times are
 such that, so only men and
women have a care to do nought that is
 unseemly, 'tis allowable to them to
discourse of what they please.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06970009"/>For in sooth, as you must know, so out of
joint are the times that
 the judges have deserted the judgment-seat, the
laws are silent, and
 ample licence to preserve his life as best he may is
accorded to each
 and all. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06970010"/>Wherefore, if you are somewhat less strict of
speech than is
 your wont, not that aught unseemly in act may follow, but
that you
 may afford solace to yourselves and others, I see not how you can
be
 open to reasonable censure on the part of any. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06970011"/>Furthermore, nought
that has been said from the first day to the present moment has,
 methinks,
in any degree sullied the immaculate honour of your
 company, nor, God
helping us, shall aught ever sully it. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06970012"/>Besides,
 who is there that knows
not the quality of your honour? which
 were proof, I make no doubt, against
not only the seductive influence
 of diverting discourse, but even the
terror of death. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06970013"/>And,
 to tell you the truth, whoso wist that you refused
to discourse of
 these light matters for a while, would be apt to suspect
that 'twas
 but for that you had yourselves erred in like sort. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06970014"/>And truly
a
 goodly honour would you confer upon me, obedient as I have ever
 been to
you, if after making me your king and your lawgiver, you
 were to refuse to
discourse of the theme which I prescribe. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06970015"/>Away,
 then, with this scruple
fitter for low minds than yours, and let each
 study how she may give us a
goodly story, and Fortune prosper her
 therein.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06970016"/>So spake the
king, and the ladies, hearkening, said that, even as
 he would, so it
should be: whereupon he gave all leave to do as they
 <pb n="108"/>might be
severally minded until the supper-hour. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06970017"/>The sun was still
 quite high in
the heaven, for they had not enlarged in their discourse:
 wherefore,
<persName>Dioneo</persName> with the other gallants being set to play
 at dice, Elisa called the
other ladies apart, and said: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06970018"/><q>There is a
 nook hard by this place, where
I think none of you has ever been:
 'tis called the Ladies' Vale: whither,
ever since we have been here,
 I have desired to take you, but time meet I
have not found until today,
 when the sun is still so high: if, then, you
are minded to visit
 it, I have no manner of doubt that, when you are
there, you will be
 very glad you came.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06970019"/>The ladies answered that they
were ready,
 and so, saying nought to the young men, they summoned one of
their maids, and set forth; nor had they gone much more than a
 mile, when
they arrived at the Vale of Ladies. They entered it by
 a very strait
gorge, through which there issued a rivulet, clear as
 crystal, and a
sight, than which nought more fair and pleasant,
 especially at that time
when the heat was great, could be imagined,
 met their eyes. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06970020"/>Within the
valley, as one of them afterwards told
 me, was a plain about half-a-mile
in circumference, and so exactly
 circular that it might have been
fashioned according to the compass,
 though it seemed a work of Nature's
art, not man's: 'twas girdled
 about by six hills of no great height, each
crowned with a palace
 that shewed as a goodly little castle. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06970021"/>The slopes of
the hills were
 graduated from summit to base after the manner of the
successive
 tiers, ever abridging their circle, that we see in our
theatres; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06970022"/>and as
 many as fronted the southern rays were all planted so
close with
 vines, olives, almond-trees, cherry-trees, fig-trees and other
fruit-bearing
 trees not a few, that there was not a hand's-breadth of
vacant space. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06970023"/>Those that fronted the north were in like manner
 covered
with copses of oak saplings, ashes and other trees, as green
 and straight
as might be. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06970024"/>Besides which, the plain, which was shut
 in on all sides save
that on which the ladies had entered, was full of
 firs, cypresses, and
bay-trees, with here and there a pine, in order
 and symmetry so meet and
excellent as had they been planted by an
 artist, the best that might be
found in that kind; wherethrough,
 even when the sun was in the zenith,
scarce a ray of light might
 reach the ground, which was all one lawn of
the finest turf, pranked
 with the hyacinth and divers other flowers. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06970025"/>Add
to which--nor was
 there aught there more delightsome--a rivulet that,
issuing from one
 <pb n="109"/>of the gorges between two of the hills,
descended over ledges of
 living rock, making, as it fell, a murmur most
gratifying to the ear,
 and, seen from a distance, shewed as a spray of
finest, powdered
 quick-silver, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06970026"/>and no sooner reached the little plain,
than 'twas
 gathered into a tiny channel, by which it sped with great
velocity
 to the middle of the plain, where it formed a diminutive lake,
like
 the fishponds that townsfolk sometimes make in their gardens, when
they have occasion for them. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06970027"/>The lake was not so deep but that a
 man might
stand therein with his breast above the water; and so
 clear, so pellucid
was the water that the bottom, which was of
 the finest gravel, shewed so
distinct, that one, had he wished, who
 had nought better to do, might have
counted the stones. Nor was it
 only the bottom that was to be seen, but
such a multitude of fishes,
 glancing to and fro, as was at once a delight
and a marvel to behold.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06970028"/>Bank it had none, but its margin was the lawn, to
which it imparted
 a goodlier freshness. So much of the water as it might
not contain
 was received by another tiny channel, through which, issuing
from
 the vale, it glided swiftly to the plain below.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06970029"/>To which
pleasaunce the damsels being come surveyed it with
 roving glance, and
finding it commendable, and marking the lake
 in front of them, did, as
'twas very hot, and they deemed themselves
 secure from observation,
resolve to take a bath. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06970030"/>So, having bidden
 their maid wait and keep watch
over the access to the vale, and give
 them warning, if haply any should
approach it, they all seven undressed
 and got into the water, which to the
whiteness of their flesh
 was even such a veil as fine glass is to the
vermeil of the rose. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06970031"/>They,
 being thus in the water, the clearness of which
was thereby in no
 wise affected, did presently begin to go hither and
thither after the
 fish, which had much ado where to bestow themselves so
as to
 escape out of their hands. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06970032"/>In which diversion they spent some time,
and caught a few, and then they hied them out of the water and
 dressed
them again, and bethinking them that 'twas time to return
 to the palace,
they began slowly sauntering thither, dilating much as
 they went upon the
beauty of the place, albeit they could not extol
 it more than they had
already done. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06970033"/>'Twas still quite early when
 they reached the palace, so
that they found the gallants yet at play
 where they had left them. To whom
quoth <persName>Pampinea</persName> with a
 smile: <q>We have stolen a march upon you
to-day.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06970034"/><q>So,</q><pb n="110"/>replied <persName>Dioneo</persName>, <q>'tis with you do
first and say after?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06970035"/><q>Ay, my
 lord,</q> returned <persName>Pampinea</persName>, and told
him at large whence they came,
 and what the place was like, and how far
'twas off, and what they
 had done. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06970036"/>What she said of the beauty of the spot
begat in the king
 a desire to see it: wherefore he straightway ordered
supper, whereof
 when all had gaily partaken, the three gallants parted
from the ladies
 and hied them with their servants to the vale, where none
of them
 had ever been before, and, having marked all its beauties,
extolled it
 as scarce to be matched in all the world. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06970037"/>Then, as the hour
was
 very late, they did but bathe, and as soon as they had resumed their
clothes, returned to the ladies, whom they found dancing a carol to
 an air
that <persName>Fiammetta</persName> sang, which done, they conversed of the
 Ladies' Vale,
waxing eloquent in praise thereof: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06970038"/>insomuch that the
 king called the
seneschal, and bade him have some beds made ready
 and carried thither on
the morrow, that any that were so minded
 might there take their siesta. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06970039"/>He
then had lights and wine and
 comfits brought; and when they had taken a
slight refection, he
 bade all address them to the dance. So at his behest
Pamfilo led a
 dance, and then the king, turning with gracious mien to
Elisa:
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06970040"/><q>Fair damsel,</q> quoth he, <q>'twas thou to-day didst me this
honour
 of the crown; and 'tis my will that thine to-night be the honour
or

voice began:</p><floatingText type="song"><body><lg><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06970042"/><l>If of thy talons,

whereat all
 wondered exceedingly, nor might any conjecture wherefore she
so
 sang. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p06970048"/>But the king, who was in a jolly humour, sent for <persName>Tindaro</persName>,
 and
bade him out with his cornemuse, and caused them tread many a

thereto, until, no small part of the night being thus spent,
 he gave leave

long after his departure that the king rose, being awaked by the stir and bustle that the

the other gallants; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07980004"/>and so, when as yet 'twas scarce clear daybreak, they all
took the road; nor seemed it to them that the nightingales and the other birds had ever
chanted so blithely as that morning. By which choir they were attended to the Ladies'
Vale, where they were greeted by other warblers not a few, that seemed rejoiced at their
arrival. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07980005"/>Roving about the vale, and surveying its beauties afresh, they rated
them higher than on the previous day, as indeed the hour was more apt to shew them
forth. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07980006"/>Then with good wine and comfits they broke their fast, and, that they
might not lag behind the songsters, they fell a singing, whereto the vale responded, ever
echoing their strains; nor did the birds, as minded not to be beaten, fail to swell the
chorus with notes of unwonted sweetness. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07980007"/>However, breakfast-time came, and
then, the tables being laid under a living canopy of trees, and beside other goodly trees
that fringed the little lake, they sat them down in order as to the king seemed meet. So
they took their meal, <pb n="113"/>glancing from time to time at the lake, where the fish
darted to and fro in multitudinous shoals, which afforded not only delight to their eyes
but matter for converse. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07980008"/>Breakfast ended, and the tables
removed, they fell a singing again more blithely than before. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07980009"/>After which,

<placeName>Florence</placeName>, in the quarter of <placeName>San Pancrazio</placeName>, a master-spinner, Gianni Lotteringhi by name,
one that had prospered in his business, but had little understanding of aught else;
insomuch that being somewhat of a simpleton, he had many a time been chosen leader of the
band of laud-singers of <placeName>Santa Maria Novella</placeName>, and had charge of their school; and not a few
like offices had he often served, upon which he greatly plumed himself. Howbeit, 'twas all
for no other reason than that, being a man of substance, he gave liberal doles to the
friars; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07010005"/>who, for that they got thereof, this one hose, another a cloak, and a
third a hood, would teach him good orisons, or give him the paternoster in the vernacular,
or the chant of St. Alexis, or the lament of St. Bernard, or the laud of Lady
<pb n="115"/>Matilda, or the like sorry stuff, which he greatly prized, and guarded with
jealous care, deeming them all most conducive to the salvation of his soul.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07010006"/>Now our
simple master-spinner had a most beautiful wife, and amorous withal, her name Monna
Tessa. Daughter she was of Mannuccio dalla Cuculla, and not a little knowing and
keen-witted; and being enamoured of Federigo di Neri Pegolotti, a handsome and lusty
gallant, as he also of her, she, knowing her husband's simplicity, took counsel with her
maid, and arranged that Federigo should come to chat with her at a right goodly
pleasure-house that the said Gianni had at <placeName>Camerata</placeName>, where she was wont to pass the
summer, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07010007"/>Gianni coming now and again to sup and sleep, and going back in the
morning to his shop, or, maybe, to his laud-singers. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07010008"/>Federigo, who desired
nothing better, went up there punctually on the appointed day about vespers, and as the
evening passed without Gianni making his appearance, did most comfortably, and to his no
small satisfaction, sup and sleep with the lady, who lying in his arms taught him that
night some six of her husband's lauds. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07010009"/>But, as neither she nor Federigo was
minded that this beginning should also be the end of
their intercourse, and that it might not be needful for the maid to go each time to make
the assignation with him, they came to the following understanding; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07010010"/>to wit,
that as often as he came and went between the house and an estate that he had a little
higher up, he should keep an eye on a vineyard that was beside the house, where he would
see an ass's head stuck on one of the poles of the vineyard, and as often as he observed
the muzzle turned towards <placeName>Florence</placeName>, he might visit her without any sort of misgiving; and
if he found not the door open, he was to tap it thrice, and she would open it; and when he
saw the muzzle of the ass's head turned towards <placeName>Fiesole</placeName>, he was to keep away, for then
Gianni would be there.
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07010011"/>Following which plan, they forgathered not seldom: 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07010012"/>but on one of
these evenings, when Federigo was to sup with Monna Tessa on two fat capons that she had
boiled, it so chanced that Gianni arrived there unexpectedly and very late, much to the
lady's chagrin: so she had a little salt meat boiled apart, on which she supped with her
husband; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07010013"/>and the maid by her orders carried the two boiled capons laid in a
spotless napkin with plenty of fresh eggs and a bottle of good wine into the garden, to
which there was access <pb n="116"/>otherwise than from the house, and where she was wont
at times to sup with Federigo; and there the maid set them down at the foot of a
peach-tree, that grew beside a lawn. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07010014"/>But in her vexation she forgot to tell the
maid to wait till Federigo should come, and let him know that Gianni was there, and he
must take his supper in the
garden: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07010015"/>and she and Gianni and the maid were scarce gone to bed, when Federigo
came and tapped once at the door, which being hard by the bedroom, Gianni heard the tap,
as did also the lady, albeit, that Gianni might have no reason to suspect her, she feigned
to be asleep. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07010016"/>Federigo waited a little, and then gave a second tap; whereupon,
wondering what it might mean, Gianni nudged his wife, saying: <q>Tessa, dost hear what I
hear? Methinks some one has tapped at our door.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07010017"/>The lady, who had heard the
noise much better than he, feigned to wake up, and: <q>How? what sayst thou?</q> quoth
she. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07010018"/><q>I say,</q> replied Gianni, <q>that, meseems, some one has tapped at our
door.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07010019"/><q>Tapped at it?</q> quoth the lady. <q>Alas, my Gianni, wottest thou
not what that is? 'Tis the
bogey, which for some nights past has so terrified me as never was,
insomuch that I never hear it but I pop my head under the clothes and venture not to put
it out again until 'tis broad day.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07010020"/><q>Come, come, wife,</q> quoth Gianni,
<q>if such it is, be not alarmed; for before we got into bed I repeated the <!--(i)-->Te
lucis<!--(/i)-->, the<!--(i)-->
Intemerata<!--(/i)-->, and divers other good orisons, besides which I made the
sign of the cross in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit at each corner of the
bed; wherefore we need have no fear that it may avail to hurt us, whatever be its
power.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07010021"/>The lady, lest Federigo, perchance suspecting a rival, should take
offence, resolved to get up, and let him understand that Gianni was there: so she said to
her husband: <q>Well, well; so sayst thou; but I for my part shall never deem myself safe
and secure, unless we exorcise it, seeing that thou art here.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07010022"/><q>Oh!</q>
said Gianni, <q>and how does one exorcise it?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07010023"/><q>That,</q> quoth the lady,
<q>I know right well; for t'other day, when I went to <placeName>Fiesole</placeName> for the pardoning, one of
those anchoresses, the saintliest creature, my Gianni, God be my witness, knowing how much
afraid I am of the bogey, taught me a holy and salutary orison, which she said she had
tried many a time before she was turned anchoress, and always with success. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07010024"/>God
wot, I should never have had courage to try it alone; but as thou art here, I propose that
<pb n="117"/>we go exorcise it together.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07010025"/>Gianni made answer that he was
quite of the same mind; so up they got, and stole to the door, on the outside of which
Federigo, now suspicious, was still waiting. And as soon as they were there: <q>Now,</q>
quoth the lady to Gianni, <q>thou wilt spit, when I tell thee.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07010026"/><q>Good,</q>
said Gianni. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07010027"/>Whereupon the lady began her orison, saying:</p><p><q type="prayer" who="monnatessa">	<!--gr 07/14: edited the formatting to make it look like the Italian--> Bogey,

	had done: <q>Now, Gianni,</q> quoth she, <q>spit</q>: and Gianni spat.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07010028"/>There was no more room for jealousy in Federigo's mind as he heard all this
	from without; nay, for all his disappointment, he was like to burst with
	suppressed laughter, and when Gianni spat, he muttered under his breath: <q>Now
	out with thy teeth.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07010029"/>The lady, having after this fashion thrice
	exorcised the bogey, went back to bed with her husband. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07010030"/>Federigo,
	disappointed of the supper that he was to have had with her, and apprehending the
	words of the orison aright, hied him to the garden, and having found the two
	capons and the wine and the eggs at the foot of the peach-tree, took them home
	with him, and supped very comfortably. And many a hearty laugh had he and the lady
	over the exorcism during their subsequent intercourse.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07010031"/>Now, true it is that
	some say that the lady had in fact turned the ass's head towards <placeName>Fiesole</placeName>, but that
	a husbandman, passing through the vineyard, had given it a blow with his stick,
	whereby it had swung round, and remained fronting <placeName>Florence</placeName>, and so it was that
	Federigo thought that he was invited, and came to the house, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07010032"/>and that
	the lady's orison was on this wise:
	<q type="prayer" who="monnatessa">	  Bogey, a God's name, away thee hie, For whoe'er turned the ass's head, 'twas not I;

what she heard when she was a girl, both stories are true; but that the latter concerned
not Gianni Lotteringhi but one Gianni di Nello, that lived at <placeName>Porta San Piero</placeName>, and was no

amorous maiden--Peronella was her name--who eked out by spinning what her husband made by
his craft; and so the pair managed as best they might on very slender
means. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07020008"/>And as chance would have it, one of the gallants of the city, taking
note of this Peronella one day, and being mightily pleased with her, fell in love with
her, and by this means and that so prevailed that he won her to accord him her
intimacy. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07020009"/>Their times of forgathering they concerted as follows: to wit, that,
her husband being wont to rise betimes of a morning to go to work or seek for work, the
gallant was to be where he might see him go forth, and, the street where she dwelt, which
is called Avorio, being scarce inhabited, was to come
into the house as soon as her husband was well out of it; and so times not a few they
did. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07020010"/>But on one of these occasions it befell that, the good man being gone
forth, and Giannello Sirignario--such was the gallant's name--being come into the house,
and being with Peronella, after a while, back came the good man, though 'twas not his wont
to return until the day was done; and finding the door locked, he knocked, and after
knocking, he fell a saying to himself: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07020011"/>O God, praised be Thy name forever; for
that, albeit Thou hast ordained that I be poor, at least Thou hast accorded me the
consolation of a good and honest girl for wife. Mark what haste she made to shut the door
when I was gone forth, that none else might enter to give her trouble.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07020012"/>Now
Peronella knew by his knock that 'twas her husband; wherefore: <q>Alas, Giannello
mine,</q> quoth she, <q>I am a dead woman, for lo, here is my husband, foul fall him! come
back! What it may import, I know not, for he is never wont to come back at this hour;
perchance he caught sight of thee as thou camest in. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07020013"/>However, for the love of
God, be it as it may, get thee into this tun that thou seest here, and I will go open to
him, and we shall see what is the occasion of this sudden return this morning.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07020014"/>So Giannello forthwith got into the tun, and Peronella went to the door, and
let in her husband, and gave him black looks, saying: <q>This is indeed a surprise that
thou art back so soon this morning! By what I see thou hast a mind to make this a holiday,
that thou returnest tools in hand; if so, what are we to live on? whence shall we get
bread to eat? Thinkest thou I will let thee pawn my gown and other bits <pb n="121"/>of
clothes? Day and night I do nought else but spin, insomuch that the flesh is fallen away
from my nails, that at least I may have oil enough to keep our lamp
alight. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07020015"/>Husband, husband, there is never a woman in the neighbourhood but
marvels and mocks at me, that I am at such labour and pains; and thou comest home to me
with thy hands hanging idle, when thou shouldst be at work.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07020016"/>Which said, she
fell a weeping and repeating: <q>Alas, alas, woe's me, in what evil hour was I born? in
what luckless moment came I hither, I, that might have had so goodly a young man, and I
would not, to take up with one that bestows never a thought on her whom he has made his
wife? <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07020017"/>Other women have a good time with their lovers, and never a one have we
here but has two or three; they take their pleasure, and make their husbands believe that
the moon is the sun; and I, alas! for that I am an honest woman, and have no such casual
amours, I suffer, and am hard bested: I know not why I provide not myself with one of
these lovers, as others do. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07020018"/>Give good heed, husband, to what I say: were I
disposed to dishonour thee, I were at no loss to find the man: for here are gallants
enough, that love me, and court me, and have sent me many an offer of money--no stint--or
dresses or jewels, should I prefer them; but my pride would never suffer it, because I was
not born of a woman of that sort: and now thou comest home to me when thou oughtest to be
at work.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07020019"/>Whereto the husband: <q>Wife, wife, for God's sake distress not
thyself: thou shouldst give me credit for knowing what manner of woman thou art, as indeed
I have partly seen this morning. True it is that I went out to work; but 'tis plain that
thou knowest not, as indeed I knew not, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07020020"/>that to-day 'tis the feast of San
Galeone, and a holiday, and that is why I am come home at this hour; but nevertheless I
have found means to provide us with bread for more than a month; for I have sold to this
gentleman, whom thou seest with me, the tun, thou wottest of, seeing that it has
encumbered the house so long, and he will give me five gigliats for it.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07020021"/>Quoth then Peronella: <q>And all this but adds to my trouble: thou, that art a
man, and goest abroad, and shouldst know affairs, hast sold for five gigliats a tun, which
I, that am but a woman, and was scarce ever out of doors, have, for that it took up so
much room in the house, sold for seven gigliats to a good man, that but now, as thou
cam'st back, got therein, to see if 'twere sound.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07020022"/>So hearing, the husband
was over<pb n="122"/>joyed, and said to the man that was come to take it away; <q>Good man,
I wish thee Godspeed; for, as thou hearest, my wife has sold the tun for seven gigliats,
whereas thou gavest me only five.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07020023"/>Whereupon: <q>So be it,</q> said the good
man, and took himself off.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07020024"/>Then said Peronella to her husband: <q>Now, as thou
art here, come
up, and arrange the matter with the good man.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07020025"/>Now Giannello, who, meanwhile,
had been all on the alert to discover if there were aught he had to fear or be on his
guard against, no sooner heard Peronella's last words, than he sprang out of the tun, and
feigning to know nought of her husband's return, began thus: <q>Where art thou, good
dame?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07020026"/>Whereto the husband, coming up, answered: <q>Here am I: what wouldst
thou of me?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07020027"/>Quoth Giannello: <q>And who art thou? I would speak with the
lady with whom I struck the bargain for this tun.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07020028"/>Then said the good
man: <q>Have no fear, you can deal with me; for I am her husband.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07020029"/>Quoth then Giannello: <q>The tun seems to me sound enough; but I think you must
have let the lees remain in it; for 'tis all encrusted with I know not what that is so
dry, that I cannot raise it with the nail; wherefore I am not minded to take it unless I
first see it scoured.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07020030"/>Whereupon Peronella: <q>To be sure: that shall not
hinder the bargain; my husband will scour it clean.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07020031"/>And: <q>Well and
good,</q> said the husband.</p><p>So he laid down his tools, stripped himself to his
vest, sent for a light and a rasp, and was in the tun, and scraping away, in a trice.
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07020032"/>Whereupon Peronella, as if she were curious to see what he did, thrust her head
into the vent of the tun, which was of no great size, and
therewithal one of her arms up to the shoulder, and fell a saying:
<q>Scrape here, and here, and there too, and look, there is a bit left
here.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07020033"/>So, she being in this posture, directing and admonishing her
husband, Giannello, who had not, that morning, fully satisfied his desire, when the
husband arrived, now seeing that as he would, he might not, brought his mind to his
circumstances, and resolved to take his pleasure as he might: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07020034"/>wherefore he made
up to the lady, who completely blocked the vent of the tun; and even on such wise as on
the open champaign the wild and lusty horses do amorously assail the mares of Parthia, he
sated his youthful appetite; and so it was that almost at the same moment that he did so,
and was off, the tun was scoured, the husband came forth of it, and <pb n="123"/>Peronella
withdrew her head from the vent, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07020035"/>and turning to
Giannello, said: <q>Take this light, good man, and see if 'tis scoured to thy mind.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07020036"/>Whereupon Giannello, looking into the tun, said that 'twas in good trim, and
that he was well content, and paid the husband the seven gigliats, and caused him carry
the tun to his house.</p></div><pb n="124"/><!--***********************************Novella 3*********************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0703"><head>Novel III</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07030001"/><!--(i)-->Fra Rinaldo lies with his gossip: her

then, that there dwelt aforetime at <placeName>Siena</placeName> a young man, right gallant and of honourable
family, his name Rinaldo; who, being in the last degree enamoured of one of his
neighbours, a most beautiful gentlewoman and the wife of a rich man, was not without hopes
that, if he could but find means to speak with her privately, he might have of her all
that he desired; but seeing no way, and the lady being pregnant, he cast about
how he might become her child's godfather. Wherefore, having ingratiated himself with her
husband, he broached the matter to him in as graceful a manner as he might; and 'twas
arranged. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07030005"/>So Rinaldo, being now godfather to Madonna <persName>Agnesa</persName>'s child, and having
a more colourable pretext for speaking to her, took courage, and told her in words that
message of his heart which she had long before read in his eyes; but though 'twas not
displeasing to the lady to hear, it availed him but little.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07030006"/>Now not long afterwards
it so befell that, whatever may have been his reason, Rinaldo betook him to friarage; and
whether it <pb n="125"/>was that he found good pasture therein, or what not, he persevered
in that way of life. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07030007"/>And though for a while after he was turned friar, he laid
aside the love he bore his gossip, and certain other vanities, yet in course of time,
without putting off the habit, he resumed them, and began to take a pride in his
appearance, and to go dressed in fine clothes, and to be quite the trim gallant, and to
compose songs and sonnets and ballades, and to sing them, and to make a brave shew in all
else that pertained to his new character.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07030008"/>But why enlarge upon our Fra
Rinaldo, of whom we speak?  what friars are there that do not the like? Ah! opprobrium of
a corrupt
world! <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07030009"/>Sleek-faced and sanguine, daintily clad, dainty in all their
accessories, they ruffle it shamelessly before the eyes of all, shewing
not as doves but as insolent cocks with raised crest and swelling bosom, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07030010"/>and,
what is worse (to say nought of the vases full of electuaries and unguents, the boxes
packed with divers comfits, the pitchers and phials of artificial waters, and oils, the
flagons brimming with Malmsey and Greek and other wines of finest quality, with which
their cells are so packed that they shew not as the cells of friars, but rather as
apothecaries' or perfumers' shops), they blush not to be known to be gouty, flattering
themselves that other folk wot not that long fasts and many of them, and coarse fare and
little of it, and sober living, make men lean and thin and for the most part healthy;
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07030011"/>or if any malady come thereof, at any rate 'tis not the gout, the wonted remedy
for which is chastity and all beside that
belongs to the regimen of a humble friar. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07030012"/>They flatter themselves, too, that
others wot not that over and above the meagre diet, long vigils and orisons and strict
discipline ought to mortify men and make them pale, and that neither St. Dominic nor
St. Francis went clad in stuff dyed in grain or any other goodly garb, but in coarse
woollen habits innocent of the dyer's art, made to keep out the cold, and not for shew. To
which matters 'twere well God had a care, no less than to the souls of the simple folk by
whom our friars are nourished.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07030013"/>Fra Rinaldo, then, being come back to his first
affections, took to visiting his gossip very frequently; and gaining confidence, began
with more insistence than before to solicit her to that which he craved of
her. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07030014"/>So, being much urged, the good lady, to whom Fra Rinaldo, perhaps, seemed
now more handsome than of yore, had
<pb n="126"/>recourse one day, when she felt herself unusually hard pressed by him, to the
common expedient of all that would fain concede what is asked of them, and said: <q>Oh!
but Fra Rinaldo, do friars then do this sort of thing?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07030015"/><q>Madam,</q>
replied Fra Rinaldo, <q>when I divest myself of this habit, which I shall do easily
enough, you will see that I am a man furnished as other men, and no friar.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07030016"/>Whereto with a truly comical air the lady made answer: <q>Alas! woe's me!  you
are my child's godfather: how might it be? nay, but 'twere a very great mischief; and many
a time I have heard that 'tis a most heinous sin; and without a doubt, were it not so, I
would do as you wish.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07030017"/><q>If,</q> said Fra Rinaldo, <q>you forego it for
such a scruple as this, you are a fool for your pains. I say not that 'tis no sin; but
there is no sin so great but God pardons it, if one repent. Now tell me: whether is more
truly father to your son, I that held him at the font, or your husband that begot him?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07030018"/><q>My husband,</q> replied the lady. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07030019"/><q>Sooth say you,</q> returned
the friar, <q>and does not your husband lie with you?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07030020"/><q>Why, yes,</q> said
the lady. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07030021"/><q>Then,</q> rejoined the friar, <q>I that am less truly your son's
father than your husband, ought also to lie with you, as does your husband.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07030022"/>The lady was no logician, and needed little to sway her: she therefore believed
or feigned to believe that what the friar said was true. So: <q>Who might avail to answer
your words of wisdom?</q> quoth she; and presently forgot the godfather in the lover, and
complied with
his desires. Nor had they begun their course to end it forthwith: but under cover of the
friar's sponsorship, which set them more at ease, as it rendered them less open to
suspicion, they forgathered again and again.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07030023"/>But on one of these occasions it so
befell that Fra Rinaldo, being come to the lady's house, where he espied none else save a
very
pretty and dainty little maid that waited on the lady, sent his companion
away with her into the pigeon-house, there to teach her the paternoster, while he and the
lady, holding her little boy by the hand, went into the bedroom, locked themselves in, got

they sped the time, it chanced that the father returned, and, before any was ware of him,
was at the bedroom door, and knocked, and called the lady by her
name. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07030025"/>Whereupon: <q>'Tis as much as my life is worth,</q> quoth Madonna <persName>Agnesa</persName>;
<q>lo, here is my husband; and <pb n="127"/>the occasion of our intimacy cannot but be now
apparent to him.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07030026"/><q>Sooth say you,</q> returned Fra Rinaldo, who was
undressed, that is to say, had thrown off his habit and hood, and was in his tunic; <q>if
I had but my habit and hood on me in any sort, 'twould be another matter; but if you let
him in, and he find me thus, 'twill not be possible to put any face on it.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07030027"/>But with an inspiration as happy as sudden: <q>Now get them on you,</q> quoth
the lady; <q>and when you have them on, take your godson in your arms, and give good heed
to what I shall say to him, that your words may accord with mine; and leave the rest to
me.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07030028"/>The good man was still knocking, when his wife made answer:
<q>Coming, coming.</q> And so up she got, and put on a cheerful
countenance and hied her to the door, and opened it and said: <q>Husband mine: well indeed
was it for us that in came Fra Rinaldo, our sponsor; 'twas God that sent him to us; for in
sooth, but for that, we had to-day lost our boy.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07030029"/>Which the poor simpleton
almost swooned to hear; and: <q>How so?</q> quoth he. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07030030"/><q>O husband mine,</q>
replied the lady, <q>he was taken but now, all of a sudden, with a fainting fit, so that I
thought he was dead: and what to do or say I knew not, had not Fra Rinaldo, our sponsor,
come just in the nick of time, and set him on his shoulder, and said: 'Gossip, 'tis that
he has worms in his body, and getting, as they do, about the heart, they might only too
readily be the death of him; but fear not; I will say a charm that will kill them all; and
before I take my leave, you will see your boy as whole as you ever saw him.'
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07030031"/>And because to say certain of the prayers thou shouldst have been with us, and
the maid
knew not where to find thee, he caused his companion to say them at the top of the house,
and he and I came in here. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07030032"/>And for that 'tis not meet for any but the boy's
mother to assist at such a service, that we might not be troubled with any one else, we
locked the door; and he yet has him in his arms; and I doubt not that he only waits till
his companion have said his prayers, and then the charm will be complete; for the boy is
already quite himself again.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07030033"/>The good simple soul, taking all this for sooth,
and overwrought by the love he bore his son, was entirely without suspicion of the trick
his wife was playing him, and heaving a great sigh, said: <q>I will go look for him.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07030034"/><q>Nay,</q> replied the wife, <q>go not: thou <pb n="128"/>wouldst spoil the
efficacy of the charm: wait here; I will go see if thou mayst safely go; and will call
thee.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07030035"/>Whereupon Fra Rinaldo, who had heard all that passed, and was in his
canonicals, and quite at his ease, and had the boy in his arms, having made sure that all
was as it should be, cried out: <q>Gossip, do I not hear the father's voice out there?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07030036"/><q>Ay indeed, Sir,</q> replied the simpleton. <q>Come in then,</q>
said Fra Rinaldo. So in came the simpleton. Whereupon quoth Fra Rinaldo: <q>I restore to
you your boy made whole by the grace of God, whom but now I scarce thought you would see
alive at vespers. You will do well to have his image fashioned in wax, not less than
life-size, and set it for a thanksgiving to God, before the statue of Master St. Ambrose,
by whose merits you have this favour of God.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07030037"/>The boy, catching sight of his
father, ran to him with joyous greetings, as little children are wont; and the father,
taking him in his arms, and weeping as if he were restored to him from the grave,
fell by turns a kissing him and thanking his godfather, that he had cured
him. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07030038"/>Fra Rinaldo's companion, who had taught the maid not one paternoster only,
but peradventure four or more, and by giving her a little purse of white thread that a nun
had given him, had made her his devotee, no sooner heard Fra Rinaldo call the simpleton
into his wife's room, than he stealthily got him to a place whence he might see and hear
what was going on. Observing that the affair was now excellently arranged, he came down,
and entered the chamber, saying: <q>Fra Rinaldo, those four prayers that you bade me say,
I have said them all.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07030039"/><q>Then well done, my brother,</q> quoth Fra Rinaldo,
<q>well-breathed must thou be. For my part, I had but said two, when my gossip came in;
but what with thy
travail and mine, God of His grace has vouchsafed us the healing or the boy.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07030040"/>The simpleton then had good wine and comfits brought in, and did the honours to
the godfather and his companion in such sort as their occasions did most demand. He then
ushered them forth of the house, commending them to God; and without delay had the waxen
image made, and directed it to be set up with the others in front of the statue of St.
Ambrose, not, be it understood, St. Ambrose of <placeName>Milan</placeName>.<note>The statue would doubtless be
that of St.  Ambrose of <placeName>Siena</placeName>, of the Dominican Order.</note></p></div><pb n="129"/><!--***********************************Novella 4*********************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0704"><head>Novel IV</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07040001"/><!--(i)-->Tofano one night locks his

by name, who took to wife Monna Ghita, a lady exceeding fair, of whom, for what cause he
knew not, he presently grew jealous.  Whereof the lady being ware, waxed resentful, and
having on divers occasions demanded of him the reason of his jealousy, and gotten from him
nought precise, but only generalities and trivialities, resolved at last to give him cause
enough to die of that evil which without cause he so much dreaded. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07040006"/>And being
ware that a gallant, whom she deemed well
<pb n="130"/>worthy of her, was enamoured of her, she, using due discretion, came to an
understanding with him; which being brought to the point that it only remained to give
effect to their words in act, the lady cast about to devise how this might
be. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07040007"/>And witting that, among other bad habits that her husband had, he was too
fond of his cups, she would not only commend indulgence, but cunningly and not seldom
incite him thereto; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07040008"/>insomuch that, well-nigh as often as she was so minded, she
led him to drink to excess; and when she saw that he was well drunken, she would put him
to bed; and so not once only but divers times without any manner of risk she forgathered
with her lover; nay, presuming upon her husband's intoxication, she grew so bold that, not
content with bringing her lover into her house, she would at times go spend a great part
of the night with him at his house, which was not far off.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07040009"/>Now such being the
enamoured lady's constant practice, it so befell that the dishonoured husband took note
that, while she egged him on to drink, she herself drank never a drop; whereby he came to
suspect the truth, to wit, that the lady was making him drunk, that afterwards she might
take her pleasure while he slept. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07040010"/>And being minded to put his surmise to the
proof, one evening, having drunken nought all day, he mimicked never so drunken a sot both
in
speech and in carriage. The lady, deeming him to be really as he appeared, and that 'twas
needless to ply him with liquor, presently put him to bed.  Which done, she, as she at
times was wont, hied her forth to her lover's house, where she tarried until midnight.
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07040011"/>Tofano no sooner perceived that his wife was gone, than up he got, hied him to
the door, locked it, and then posted himself at the window to observe her return, and let
her know that he was ware of her misconduct. So there he stood until the lady returned,
and finding herself locked out, was annoyed beyond measure, and sought to force the door
open. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07040012"/>Tofano let her try her strength upon it a while, and then: <q>Madam,</q>
quoth he, <q>'tis all to no purpose: thou canst not get in. Go get thee back thither where
thou hast tarried all this while, and rest assured that thou shalt never recross this
threshold, until I have done thee such honour as is meet for thee in the presence of thy
kinsfolk and neighbours.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07040013"/>Thereupon the lady fell entreating him to be
pleased to open to her for the love of God, for that she was not come whence he supposed,
but had only been passing the time
<pb n="131"/>with one of her gossips, because the nights were long, and she could not spend
the whole time either in sleep or in solitary watching.
But her supplications availed her nothing, for the fool was determined
that all <placeName>Arezzo</placeName> should know their shame, whereof as yet none wist aught.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07040014"/>So as
'twas idle to entreat, the lady assumed a menacing tone, saying: <q>So thou open not to
me, I will make thee the saddest man alive.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07040015"/>Whereto Tofano made answer:
<q>And what then canst thou do?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07040016"/>The lady, her wits sharpened by Love,
rejoined: <q>Rather than endure the indignity to which thou wouldst unjustly subject me, I
will cast myself into the well hard by here, and when I am found dead there, all the world
will believe that 'twas thou that didst it in thy cups, and so thou wilt either have to
flee and lose all that thou hast and be outlawed, or forfeit thy head as guilty of my
death, as indeed thou wilt be.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07040017"/>But, for all she said, Tofano wavered not a
jot in his foolish purpose. So at last: <q>Lo, now,</q> quoth the lady, <q>I can no more
abide thy surly humour: God forgive thee: I leave thee my distaff here, which be careful
to bestow in a safe place.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07040018"/>So saying, away she hied her to the well, and,
the night being so dark that wayfarers could scarce see one another as they passed, she
took up a huge stone that was by the well, and ejaculating, <q>God forgive me!</q> dropped
it therein. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07040019"/>Tofano, hearing the mighty splash that the stone made as it struck
the water, never doubted that she had cast herself in: so, bucket and rope in hand, he
flung himself out of the house, and came running to the well to her rescue. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07040020"/>The
lady had meanwhile hidden herself hard by the door, and seeing him make for the well, was
in the house in a trice, and having locked the door, hied her to the window, and greeted
him with: <q>'Tis while thou art drinking, not now, when the night is far spent, that thou
shouldst temper thy wine with water.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07040021"/>Thus derided, Tofano came back to the
door, and finding his ingress barred, began adjuring her to let him
in. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07040022"/>Whereupon, changing the low tone she had hitherto used for one so shrill
that 'twas well-nigh a shriek, she broke out with: <q>By the Holy Rood, tedious drunken
sot that thou art, thou gettest no admittance here to-night; thy ways are more than I can
endure: 'tis time I let all the world know what manner of man thou art, and at what hour
of the night thou comest home.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07040023"/>Tofano, on his part, now grew angry, and
began loudly to upbraid her; insomuch that the neighbours, aroused by the noise, 
<pb n="132"/>got up, men and women alike, and looked out of the windows, and asked what was the
matter. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07040024"/>Whereupon the lady fell a weeping and saying: <q>'Tis this wicked man,
who comes home drunk at even, or falls asleep in some tavern, and then returns at this
hour.  Long and to no purpose have I borne with him; but 'tis now past endurance, and I
have done him this indignity of locking him out of
the house in the hope that perchance it may cause him to mend his
ways.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07040025"/>Tofano, on his part, told, dolt that he was, just what had happened, and
was mighty menacing. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07040026"/>Whereupon: <q>Now mark,</q> quoth the lady to the
neighbours, <q>the sort of man he is!  What would you say if I were, as he is, in the
street, and he were in the house, as I am?  God's faith, I doubt you would believe what he
said. Hereby you may gauge his sense. He tells you that I have done just what, I doubt
not, he has done himself. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07040027"/>He thought to terrify me by throwing I know not what
into the well, wherein would to God he had thrown himself indeed, and drowned himself,
whereby the wine of which he has taken more than enough, had
been watered to some purpose!</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07040028"/>The neighbours, men and women alike, now with
one accord gave tongue, censuring Tofano, throwing all the blame upon him, and answering
what he alleged against the lady with loud recrimination; and in short the bruit, passing
from neighbour to neighbour, reached at last the ears of the lady's kinsfolk;
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07040029"/>who hied them to the spot, and being apprised of the affair from this, that and
the other of the neighbours, laid hands on Tofano, and beat him till he was black and blue
from head to foot. Which done, they entered his house, stripped it of all that belonged to
the lady, and took her home with them, bidding Tofano look for worse to come.
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07040030"/>Thus hard bested, and ruing the plight in which his jealousy had landed him,
Tofano, who loved his wife with all his heart, set some friends to work to patch matters
up, whereby he did in fact induce his lady to forgive him and live with him again; albeit
he was fain to promise her never again to be jealous, and to give her leave to amuse
herself to her heart's content, provided she used such discretion that he should not be
ware of it. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07040031"/>On such wise, like the churl and booby that he was, being
despoiled, he made terms. Now long live

	grow jealous without due cause. And had our legislators taken account of everything, I am
	of opinion that they would have visited ladies in such a

	stays at home, occupied with her domestic duties; after which, on the day that is sacred

great substance in lands and goods and money, who, having a most beautiful woman to wife,
waxed inordinately jealous of her, and that for no better reason than that, loving her
greatly, and esteeming her exceeding fair, and knowing that she did her utmost endeavour
to pleasure him, he must needs suppose that every man loved her, and esteemed her fair,
and that she, moreover, was as zealous to stand well with every other man as with himself;
whereby you may see that he was a poor creature, and of little sense. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050008"/>Being
thus so deeply infected with jealousy, he kept so strict and close watch over her, that
some, maybe, have lain under sentence of death and been less
rigorously confined by their warders. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050009"/>'Twas not merely that the lady might not
go to a wedding, or a festal gathering, or even to church, or indeed set foot out of doors
in any sort; but she dared not so much as shew herself at a window, or cast a glance
outside the house, no matter for what purpose. Wherefore she led a most woeful life of it,
and found it all the harder to bear because she knew herself to be
innocent. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050010"/>Accordingly, seeing herself evilly entreated by her husband without
good cause, she cast about how for her own consolation she might devise means to justify
his usage of her. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050011"/>And for that, as she might not shew herself at the window,
there could be no interchange of amorous glances between her and any man that passed along
the street, but she wist that in the next house there was a goodly and debonair gallant,
she bethought her, that, if there were but a hole in the wall that divided the two houses,
she might watch
thereat, until she should have sight of the gallant on such wise that she might speak to
him, and give him her love, if he cared to have it, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050012"/>and, if so it might be
contrived, forgather with him now and again, and after this fashion relieve the burden of
her woeful life, until such time as the evil spirit should depart from her
husband. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050013"/>So peering about, now here, now there, when her husband was away, she
found <pb n="135"/>in a very remote part of the house a place, where, by chance, the wall
had a little chink in it. Peering through which, she made out, though not without great
difficulty, that on the other side was a room, and said to herself: If this were <persName>Filippo</persName>'s
room--<persName>Filippo</persName> was the name of the gallant, her neighbour--I should be already halfway to
my goal. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050014"/>So cautiously, through her maid, who was grieved to see her thus
languish, she made quest, and discovered that it was indeed the gallant's room, where he
slept quite alone. Wherefore she now betook her frequently to the aperture, and whenever
she was ware that the gallant was in the room, she would let fall a pebble or the like
trifle; whereby at length she brought the gallant to the other side of the aperture to see
what the matter was. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050015"/>Whereupon she
softly called him, and he knowing her voice, answered; and so, having now the opportunity
she had sought, she in few words opened to him all her mind. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050016"/>The gallant, being
overjoyed, wrought at the aperture on such wise that albeit none might be ware thereof, he
enlarged it; and there many a time they held converse together, and touched hands, though
further they might not go by reason of the assiduous watch that the jealous husband
kept.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050017"/>Now towards Christmas the lady told her husband that, if he
approved, she would fain go on Christmas morning to church, and confess and communicate,
like other Christians. <q>And what sins,</q> quoth he, <q>hast thou committed, that
wouldst be shriven?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050018"/><q>How?</q> returned the lady; <q>dost thou take me for
a saint? For all thou keepest me so close, thou must know very well that I am like all
other mortals. However, I am not minded to confess to thee, for that thou art no
priest.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050019"/>Her husband, whose suspicions were excited by what she had said,
cast about how he might discover these sins of hers, and having bethought him of what
seemed an apt expedient, made answer that she had his consent, but he would not have her
go to any church but their own chapel, where she might hie her betimes in the morning, and
confess either to their own chaplain or some other priest that the chaplain might assign
her, but to none other, and presently return to the house. The lady thought she half
understood him, but she answered only that she would do as he required.
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050020"/>Christmas morning came, and with the dawn the lady rose, dressed herself, and
hied her to the church appointed by her husband, who also rose, and hied him to the same
<pb n="136"/>church, where he arrived before her; and having already concerted matters with
the priest that was in charge, he forthwith put on one of the priest's robes with a great
hood, overshadowing the face, such as we see priests wear, and which he pulled somewhat
forward; and so disguised he seated himself in the choir.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050021"/>On entering the church
the lady asked for the priest, who came, and learning that she was minded to confess, said
that he could not
hear her himself, but would send her one of his brethren; so away he hied him and sent
her, in an evil hour for him, her husband.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050022"/>For though he wore an air of great
solemnity, and 'twas not yet broad day, and he had pulled the hood well over his eyes, yet
all did not avail, but that his lady forthwith recognized him, and said to herself: God be
praised! why, the jealous rogue is turned priest: but leave it me to give him that whereof
he is in quest. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050023"/>So she feigned not to know him, and seated herself at his
feet. (I should tell you that he had put some pebbles in his mouth, that his speech, being
impeded, might not betray him to his wife, and in all other respects he deemed himself so
thoroughly disguised that there was
nought whereby she might recognize him.) <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050024"/>Now, to come to the confession, the

enamoured of a priest, who came every night to lie with her. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050025"/>Which to hear was
to her husband as if he were stricken through the heart with a knife; and had it not been
that he was bent on knowing more, he would have forthwith given over the confession, and
taken himself off. However he kept his place, and: <q>How?</q> said he to the lady,
<q>does not your husband lie with you?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050026"/>The lady replied in the affirmative.
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050027"/><q>How, then,</q> quoth the husband, <q>can the priest also lie with you?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050028"/><q>Sir,</q> replied she, <q>what art the priest employs I know not; but door
there is none, however well locked, in the house,

whereupon he opens the door, and enters the room, and lies with me; and so 'tis always,
without fail.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050029"/><q>Then 'tis very wrong, Madam, and you must give it up

it up, I would.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050033"/><q>Madam,</q> replied the husband, <q>indeed I am sorry for
you; for I see that you are in a fair way to lose your soul. However, this I will do for
you; I will make special supplication to God on your behalf; and perchance you may be
profited thereby. And from time to time I will send you one of my young clerks; and you
will tell him whether my prayers have been of any help to you, or no, and if they have
been so, I shall know what to do next.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050034"/><q>Nay, Sir,</q> quoth the lady,
<q>do not so; send no man to me at home; for, should my husband come to know it, he is so
jealous that nothing in the world would ever disabuse him of the idea that he came but for
an evil
purpose, and so I should have no peace with him all the year long.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050035"/><q>Madam,</q> returned the husband, <q>have no fear; rest assured that I will
so order matters that you shall never hear a word about it from him.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050036"/><q>If
you can make sure of that,</q> quoth the lady, <q>I have no more to say.</q> And so, her
confession ended, and her penance enjoined, she rose, and went to mass, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050037"/>while
the luckless husband, fuming and fretting, hasted to divest himself of his priest's
trappings, and then went home bent upon devising some means to bring the priest and his
wife together, and take his revenge upon them both.</p><p>When the lady came home
from church she read in her husband's face that she had spoiled his Christmas for him,
albeit he dissembled to the uttermost, lest she should discover what he had done, and
supposed himself to have learned. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050038"/>His mind was made up to keep watch for the
priest that very night by his own front door. So to the lady he said: <q>I have to go out
to-night to sup and sleep; so thou wilt take care that the front door, and the mid-stair
door, and the bedroom door are well locked; and for the rest thou mayst go to bed, at
thine own time.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050039"/><q>Well and good,</q> replied the lady: 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050040"/>and as
soon as she was able, off she hied her to the aperture, and gave the wonted signal, which
<persName>Filippo</persName> no sooner heard, than he was at the spot. The lady then told him what she had done
in the morning, and what her husband had said to her after breakfast, adding: <q>Sure I am
that he will not stir out of the house, but will keep watch beside the door; wherefore
contrive to come in to-night by the roof, that we may be together.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050041"/><q>Madam,</q> replied the gallant, nothing loath, <q>trust me for that.</q></p><pb n="138"/><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050042"/>Night came, the husband armed, and noiselessly hid himself in a room on the ground
floor: the lady locked all the doors, being especially careful to secure the mid-stair
door, to bar her husband's ascent; and in due time the gallant, having found his way
cautiously enough over the roof, they got them to bed, and there had solace of one another
and a good time; and at daybreak the gallant hied him back to his
house. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050043"/>Meanwhile the husband, rueful and supperless, half dead with cold, kept
his armed watch beside his door, momently expecting the priest, for the best part of the
night; but towards daybreak, his powers failing him, he lay down and slept in the
ground-floor room. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050044"/>'Twas hard upon tierce when he awoke, and the front door was
then open; so, making as if he had just come in, he went upstairs and breakfasted. Not
long afterwards he sent to his wife a young fellow, disguised as the priest's underling,
who asked her if he of whom she wist had been with her again. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050045"/>The lady, who
quite understood what that meant, made answer that he had not come that night, and that,
if he continued to neglect her so, 'twas possible he might be forgotten, though she had no
mind to forget him.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050046"/>Now, to make a long story short, the husband passed many a
night in the same way, hoping to catch the priest as he came in, the lady and her gallant
meanwhile having a good time. But at last the husband, being able to stand it no longer,
sternly demanded of his wife what she had said to the priest the morning when she was
confessed. The lady answered that she was not minded to tell him, for that 'twas not
seemly or proper so to do. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050047"/>Whereupon: <q>Sinful woman,</q> quoth the husband,
<q>in thy despite I know what thou saidst to him, and know I must and will who this priest
is, of whom thou art enamoured, and who by dint of his incantations lies with thee a
nights, or I will sluice thy veins for thee.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050048"/><q>'Tis not true,</q> replied
the lady, <q>that I am enamoured of a priest.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050049"/><q>How?</q> quoth the
husband, <q>saidst thou not as much to the priest that confessed thee?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050050"/><q>Thou canst not have had it from
him,</q> rejoined the lady. <q>Wast thou then present thyself? For sure I never told him
so.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050051"/><q>Then tell me,</q> quoth the husband, <q>who this priest is; and lose
no time about it.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050052"/>Whereat the lady began to smile, and: <q>I find it not a
little diverting,</q> quoth she, <q>that a wise man should suffer himself to be led by a
simple woman <pb n="139"/>as a ram is led by the horns to the shambles; albeit no wise man
art thou: not since that fatal hour when thou gavest harbourage in thy breast, thou wist
not why, to the evil spirit of jealousy; and the more foolish and insensate thou art, the
less glory have I.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050053"/>Deemest thou, my husband, that I am as blind of the bodily
eye as thou art of the mind's eye? Nay, but for sure I am not so.  I knew at a glance the
priest that confessed me, and that 'twas even thyself. But I was minded to give thee that
of which thou wast in quest, and I gave it thee. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050054"/>Howbeit, if thou hadst been
the wise man thou takest thyself to be, thou wouldst not have chosen such a way as that to
worm out thy good lady's secrets, nor wouldst thou have fallen a prey to a baseless
suspicion, but wouldst have understood that what she confessed was true, and she all the
while guiltless. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050055"/>I told thee that I loved a priest; and wast not thou, whom I
love, though ill enough dost thou deserve it, turned priest? I told thee that there was no
door in my house but would open when he was minded to lie with me: and when thou wouldst
fain have access to me, what door was ever closed against thee?  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050056"/>I told thee
that the priest lay nightly with me: and what night was there that thou didst not lie with
me? Thou sentest thy young clerk to me: and thou knowest that, as often as thou hadst not
been with me, I sent word that the priest had not been with me. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050057"/>Who but thou,
that hast suffered jealousy to blind thee, would have been so witless as not to read such
a riddle? But thou must needs mount guard at night beside the door, and think to make me
believe that thou hadst gone out to sup and sleep.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050058"/>Consider thy ways, and
court not the mockery of those that know them as I do, but turn a man again as thou wast
wont to be: and let there be no more of this strict restraint in which thou keepest me;
for I swear to thee by God that, if I were minded to set horns on thy brow, I should not
fail so to take my pastime that thou wouldst never find it out, though thou hadst a
hundred eyes, as thou hast but two.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07050059"/>Thus admonished, the jealous caitiff, who
had flattered himself that he had very cunningly discovered his wife's secret, was
ashamed, and made no answer save to commend his wife's wit and honour; and thus, having
cause for jealousy, he discarded it, as he <pb n="140"/>had erstwhile been jealous without
cause.  And so the adroit lady had, as it were, a charter of indulgence, and needed no
more to contrive for her lover to come to her over the roof like a cat, but admitted him
by the door, and using due discretion, had many a good time with him, and sped her life
gaily.</p></div><pb n="141"/><!--***********************************Novella 6*********************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0706"><head>Novel VI</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07060001"/><!--(i)-->Madonna <persName>Isabella</persName> has with her Leonetto, her

young gentlewoman, fair exceedingly, and wedded to a most worthy and excellent
gentleman. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07060005"/>And as it not seldom happens that one cannot keep ever to the same
diet, but would fain at times vary it, so this lady, finding her husband not altogether to
her mind, became enamoured of a gallant, Leonetto by name, who, though of no high rank,
was not a little debonair and courteous, and he in like manner
fell in love with her; and (as you know that 'tis seldom that what is
mutually desired fails to come about) 'twas not long before they had
fruition of their love. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07060006"/>Now the lady being, as I said, fair and winsome,
it so befell that a gentleman, Messer <persName>Lambertuccio</persName> by name, grew mightily enamoured of
her, but so tiresome and odious did she <pb n="142"/>find him, that for the world she could
not bring herself to love him.  So, growing tired of fruitlessly soliciting her favour by
ambassage, Messer <persName>Lambertuccio</persName>, who was a powerful signior, sent her at last another sort
of message in which he threatened to defame her if she complied not with his
wishes. Wherefore the lady, knowing her man, was terrified, and disposed herself to
pleasure him.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07060007"/>Now it so chanced that Madonna <persName>Isabella</persName>, for such was the lady's
name, being gone, as is our Florentine custom in the summer, to spend some time on a very
goodly estate that she had in the contado, one morning finding herself alone, for her
husband had ridden off to tarry some days elsewhere, she sent for Leonetto to come and
keep her company; and Leonetto came forthwith in high glee. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07060008"/>But while they were
together, Messer <persName>Lambertuccio</persName>, who, having got wind that the husband was away, had mounted
his horse and ridden thither quite alone, knocked at the door. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07060009"/>Whereupon the
lady's maid hied her forthwith to her mistress, who was alone with Leonetto, and called
her, saying: <q>Madam, Messer <persName>Lambertuccio</persName> is here below, quite alone.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07060010"/>Whereat the lady was vexed beyond measure; and being also not a little
dismayed, she said to Leonetto: <q>Prithee, let it not irk thee to withdraw behind the
curtain, and there keep close until Messer <persName>Lambertuccio</persName> be gone.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07060011"/>Leonetto,
who stood in no less fear of Messer <persName>Lambertuccio</persName> than did the lady, got into his
hiding-place; and the lady bade the maid go open to Messer <persName>Lambertuccio</persName>: she did so; and
having dismounted and fastened his palfrey to a pin, he ascended the stairs; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07060012"/>at
the head of which the lady received him with a smile and as gladsomea greeting as she
could find words for, and asked him on what errand he was come.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07060013"/>The gentleman
embraced and kissed her, saying: <q>My soul, I am informed that your husband is not here,
and therefore I am come to stay a while with you.</q> Which said, they went into the room,
and locked them in, and Messer <persName>Lambertuccio</persName> fell a toying with her.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07060014"/>Now, while thus
he sped the time with her, it befell that the lady's husband, albeit she nowise expected
him, came home, and, as he drew nigh the palace, was observed by the maid, who forthwith
ran to the lady's chamber, and said: <q>Madam, the master will be here anon; I doubt he is
already in the courtyard.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07060015"/>Whereupon, for that she had two men in the house,
and the knight's palfrey, that was in the courtyard, made it impossible to hide him, the
lady gave <pb n="143"/>herself up for dead. Nevertheless she made up her mind on the spur
of the moment, and springing out of bed: <q>Sir,</q> quoth she to Messer <persName>Lambertuccio</persName>,
<q>if you have any regard for me, and would save my life, you will do as I bid you:
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07060016"/>that is to say, you will draw your blade, and put on a fell and wrathful
countenance, and hie you downstairs, saying: 'By God, he shall not escape me elsewhere.'
And if my husband would stop you, or ask you aught, say nought but what I have told you,
and get you on horseback and tarry with him on no account.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07060017"/><q>To hear is to
obey,</q> quoth Messer <persName>Lambertuccio</persName>, who, with the flush of his recent exertion and the
rage that he felt at the husband's return still on his face, and drawn sword in hand, did
as she bade him. The lady's husband, being now dismounted in the courtyard, and not a
little surprised to see the palfrey there, was about to go up the stairs, when he saw
Messer <persName>Lambertuccio</persName> coming down them, and marvelling both at his words and at
his mien: <q>What means this, Sir?</q> quoth he. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07060018"/>But Messer <persName>Lambertuccio</persName>
clapped foot in stirrup, and mounted, saying nought but: <q>Zounds, but I will meet him
elsewhere;</q> and so he rode off.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07060019"/>The gentleman then ascended the stairs, at the
head of which he found his lady distraught with terror, to whom he said: <q>What manner of
thing is this? After whom goes Messer <persName>Lambertuccio</persName>, so wrathful and menacing?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07060020"/>Whereto the lady, drawing nigher the room, that Leonetto might hear her, made
answer: <q>Never, Sir, had I such a fright as this. There came running in here a young
man, who to me is quite a stranger, and at his heels Messer <persName>Lambertuccio</persName> with a drawn
sword in his hand; and as it happened the young man found the door of this room open, and
trembling in every limb, cried out: 'Madam, your succour, for God's sake, that I die not
in your arms.'  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07060021"/>So up I got, and would have asked him who he was, and how
bested, when up came Messer <persName>Lambertuccio</persName>, exclaiming: 'Where art thou, traitor?' I planted
myself in the doorway, and kept him from entering, and seeing that I was not minded to
give him admittance, he was courteous enough, after not a little parley, to take himself
off, as you saw.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07060022"/>Whereupon:
<q>Wife,</q> quoth the husband, <q>thou didst very right. Great indeed had been the
scandal, had some one been slain here, and 'twas a gross affront on Messer <persName>Lambertuccio</persName>'s
part to pursue a fugitive within the house.</q> He then asked where the young man
was. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07060023"/>Whereto <pb n="144"/>the lady answered: <q>Nay, where he may be hiding,
Sir, I wot not.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07060024"/>So: <q>Where art thou?</q> quoth the knight. <q>Fear not to
shew thyself.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07060025"/>Then forth of his hiding-place, all of a tremble, for in

knight. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07060027"/><q>Nothing in the world,</q> replied the young man: <q>wherefore, I
doubt he must either be out of his mind, or have mistaken me for another; for no sooner
had he sight of me in the street hard by the palace, than he laid his hand on his sword,
and exclaimed: 'Traitor, thou art a dead man.'  Whereupon I sought not to know why,but
fled with all speed, and got me here, and so, thanks to God and this gentlewoman, I
escaped his hands.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07060028"/><q>Now away with thy fears,</q> quoth the knight; <q>I
will see thee home safe and sound; and then 'twill be for thee to

set him on horseback, and escorted him to <placeName>Florence</placeName>, and left him not until he was safe in
his own house. And the very same evening, following the lady's instructions, Leonetto
spoke privily with Messer <persName>Lambertuccio</persName>, and so composed the affair with him, that, though

wealthy; and having by his lady an only son, Lodovico by name, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07070005"/>whose nobility
disrelished trade, he would not put him in any shop;
but that he might be with other gentlemen, he caused him to enter the service of the King
of <placeName>France</placeName>, whereby he acquired very fine manners and other
accomplishments. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07070006"/>Being in this service, Lodovico was one day with some other
young gallants that talked of the fair ladies of <placeName>France</placeName>, and <placeName>England</placeName>, and other parts of
the world, when they were joined by certain knights that were returned from the Holy

in the whole world, so far as he had explored it, there was not any lady, of all that he
had ever seen, that might compare for beauty with Madonna Beatrice, the wife of Egano de'

<pb n="146"/>in common with him had seen the lady at <placeName>Bologna</placeName>, concurred.
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07070007"/>Which report Lodovico, who was as yet fancy-free, no sooner heard, than he
burned with such a yearning to see the lady that he was able to think of nought else:
insomuch that he made up his mind to betake him to <placeName>Bologna</placeName> to see her, and if she pleased
him, to remain there; to which end he gave his father to understand that he would fain
visit the <placeName>Holy Sepulchre</placeName>, whereto his father after no little demur consented.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07070008"/>So to
<placeName>Bologna</placeName> Anichino--for so he now called himself--came; and, as Fortune would have it, the

than he had expected: wherefore he waxed most ardently enamoured of her, and resolved
never to quit <placeName>Bologna</placeName>, until he had gained her love. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07070009"/>So, casting about how he
should proceed, he could devise no other way but to enter her husband's service, which was
the more easy that he kept not a few retainers: on this wise Lodovico surmised that,
peradventure, he might compass his end. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07070010"/>He therefore sold his horses and meetly
bestowed his servants, bidding them make as if they
knew him not; and being pretty familiar with his host, he told him that he was minded to
take service with some worthy lord, it any such he might find. <q>Thou wouldst make,</q>
quoth the host, <q>the very sort of retainer to suit a gentleman of this city, Egano by

mention the matter to him.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07070011"/>And so he accordingly did, and before he took
leave of Egano had placed Anichino with him, to Egano's complete satisfact ion.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07070012"/>Being thus resident with Egano, and having abundant opportunities of seeing the fair
lady, Anichino set himself to serve Egano with no little zeal; wherein he succeeded so
well, that Egano was
more than satisfied, insomuch that by and by there was nought he could do without his
advice, and he entrusted to him the guidance not only of himself, but of all his
affairs. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07070013"/>Now it so befell that one day when Egano was gone a hawking, having
left Anichino at home, Madonna Beatrice, who as yet wist not of his love, albeit she had

commended them, sat herself down with him to a game of chess, which, to please her,
Anichino most dexterously contrived to lose, to the lady's prodigious delight.
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07070014"/>After a while, the <pb n="147"/>lady's women, one and all, gave over watching

request that he would be pleased to tell her the occasion of his sighs.
Whereupon: <q>Madam,</q> said Anichino, <q>I greatly fear me, that, were I to tell it you,
'twould but vex you; and, moreover, I doubt you might repeat it to some one else.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07070019"/><q>Rest assured,</q> returned the lady, <q>that I shall neither be annoyed,

report he had heard of her, and where and how he had become enamoured of her, and with
what intent he had taken service with her husband: after which, he humbly besought her,
that, if it might be, she would have pity on him, and gratify this his secret and ardent
desire; and that, if she were not minded so to do, she would suffer him to retain his

answer: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07070023"/><q>Sweet my Anichino, be of good cheer; neither presents nor

<pb n="148"/>I deem thee to have won right worthily; and so I give it thee, and vow to give
thee joyance thereof before the coming night be past.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07070025"/>To which end thou wilt
come to my room about midnight; I will leave the door open; thou knowest the side of the
bed on which I sleep; thou wilt come there; should I be asleep, thou hast but to touch me,
and I shall awake, and give thee solace of thy long-pent desire. In earnest whereof I will
even give thee a kiss.</q> So saying, she threw her arms about his neck, and lovingly
kissed him, as Anichino her.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07070026"/>Their colloquy thus ended, Anichino betook him
elsewhere about some matters which he had to attend to, looking forward to midnight with
boundless exultation. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07070027"/>Egano came in from his hawking; and after supper, being
weary, went straight to bed, whither the lady soon followed him, leaving, as she had
promised, the door of the
chamber open. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07070028"/>Thither accordingly, at the appointed hour, came Anichino, and
having softly entered the chamber, and closed the door behind him, stole up to where the
lady lay, and laying his hand upon her breast, found that she was awake. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07070029"/>Now,
as soon as she wist that Anichino was come, she took his hand in both her own; and keeping
fast hold of him, she turned about in the bed, until she awoke Egano;
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07070030"/>whereupon: <q>Husband,</q> quoth she, <q>I would not say aught of this to thee,
yestereve, because I judged thou wast weary; but tell me, upon thy hope of salvation,
Egano, whom deemest thou thy best and most loyal retainer, and the most attached to
thee, of all that thou hast in the house?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07070031"/><q>What a question is this,
wife?</q> returned Egano. <q>Dost not know him? Retainer I have none, nor ever had, so
trusted, or loved, as Anichino. But wherefore put such a question?</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07070032"/>Now, when
Anichino wist that Egano was awake, and heard them talk of himself, he more than once
tried to withdraw his hand,
being mightily afraid lest the lady meant to play him false; but she held it so tightly
that he might not get free, while thus she made answer to Egano: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07070033"/><q>I will tell
thee what he is. I thought that he was all thou sayst, and that none was so loyal to thee
as he, but he has undeceived me, for that yesterday, when thou wast out a hawking, he,
being here, chose his time, and had the shamelessness to crave of me compliance with his
wanton desires: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07070034"/>and I, that I might not need other evidence than that of thine
own senses to prove his guilt to thee, <pb n="149"/>I made answer, that I was well content,
and that to-night, after midnight, I would get me into the garden, and await him there at
the foot of the pine. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07070035"/>Now go thither I shall certainly not; but, if thou
wouldst prove the loyalty of thy retainer, thou canst readily do so, if thou but slip on
one of my loose robes, and cover thy face with a veil, and go down and attend his coming,
for come, I doubt not, he will.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07070036"/>Whereto Egano: <q>Meet indeed it is,</q>
quoth he, <q>that I should go see;</q> and straightway up he got, and, as best he might in
the dark, he put on one of the lady's loose robes and veiled his face, and then hied him
to the garden, and sate down at the foot of the pine to await Anichino. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07070037"/>The
lady no sooner wist that he was out of the room, than she rose, and locked the
door. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07070038"/>Anichino, who
had never been so terrified in all his life, and had struggled with all
his might to disengage his hand from the lady's clasp, and had inwardly cursed her and his
love, and himself for trusting her, a hundred thousand times, was overjoyed beyond measure
at this last turn that she had given the affair. And so, the lady having got her to bed
again, and he, at her bidding, having stripped and laid him down beside her, they had
solace and joyance of one another for a good while. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07070039"/>Then, the lady, deeming it
unmeet for Anichino to tarry longer with her, caused him to get up and resume his clothes,
saying to him: <q>Sweet my mouth, thou wilt take a stout cudgel,
and get thee to the garden, and making as if I were there, and thy suit to me had been but
to try me, thou wilt give Egano a sound rating with thy tongue and a sound belabouring
with thy cudgel, the sequel whereof will be wondrously gladsome and delightful.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07070040"/>Whereupon Anichino hied him off to the garden, armed with a staff of wild
willow; and as he drew nigh the pine, Egano saw him, and rose and came forward to meet him
as if he would receive him with the heartiest of cheer. But: <q>Ah! wicked woman!</q>
quoth Anichino; <q>so thou art come! Thou didst verily believe, then, that I was, that I
am, minded thus to wrong my lord? Foul fall thee a
thousand times!</q> And therewith he raised his cudgel, and began to lay about
him. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07070041"/>Egano, however, had heard and seen enough, and without a word took to
flight, while Anichino pursued him, crying out: <q>Away with thee!  God send thee a bad
year, lewd woman that thou art; nor doubt that Egano shall hear of this to-morrow.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07070042"/>Egano, having received sundry round knocks, got him back to his 
<pb n="150"/>chamber with what speed he might; and being asked by the lady, whether Anichino
had come into the garden: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07070043"/><q>Would to God he had not!</q> quoth he, <q>for
that, taking me for thee, he has beaten me black and blue with his cudgel, and rated me
like the vilest woman that ever was: passing strange, indeed, it had seemed to me that he
should have said those words to thee with intent to dishonour me;
and now 'tis plain that 'twas but that, seeing thee so blithe and
frolicsome, he was minded to prove thee.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07070044"/>Whereto: <q>God be
praised,</q> returned the lady, <q>that he proved me by words, as thee by
acts: and I doubt not he may say that I bear his words with more patience than thou his
acts. But since he is so loyal to thee, we must make much of him and do him honour.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07070045"/><q>Ay, indeed,</q> quoth Egano, <q>thou sayst sooth.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07070046"/>Thus was Egano
fortified in the belief that never had any gentleman wife so true, or retainer so loyal,
as he; and many a hearty
laugh had he with Anichino and his lady over this affair, which to them was the occasion
that, with far less let than might else have been, they were able to have solace and
joyance of one another, so long as it pleased Anichino to tarry at <placeName>Bologna</placeName>.</p></div><pb n="151"/><!--***********************************Novella 8*********************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0708"><head>Novel VIII</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080001"/><!--(i)-->A husband

then, that there dwelt aforetime in our
city a most wealthy merchant, Arriguccio Berlinghieri by name, who foolishly, as we wot by
daily experience is the way of merchants, thinking to compass gentility by matrimony, took
to wife a young gentlewoman, by no means suited to him, whose name was Monna
Sismonda. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080005"/>Now Monna Sismonda, seeing that her husband was much abroad, and gave
her little of his <pb n="152"/>company, became enamoured of a young gallant, Ruberto by
name, who had long courted her: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080006"/>and she being grown pretty familiar with him,
and using, perchance, too little discretion, for she affected him extremely, it so befell
that Arriguccio, whether it was that he detected somewhat, or howsoever, waxed of all men
the most jealous, and gave up going abroad, and changed his way of life altogether, and
made it his sole care to watch over his wife, insomuch that he never allowed himself a
wink of sleep until he had seen her to bed: which occasioned the lady the most grievous
dumps, because 'twas on no wise possible for her to be with her Ruberto.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080007"/>So,
casting about in many ways how she might contrive to meet him, and
being thereto not a little plied by Ruberto himself, she bethought her at last of the
following expedient: to wit, her room fronting the street, and Arriguccio, as she had
often observed, being very hard put to it to get him to sleep, but thereafter sleeping
very soundly, she resolved to arrange with Ruberto that he should come to the front door
about midnight, whereupon she would get her down, and open the door, and stay some time
with him while her husband was in his deep sleep. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080008"/>And that she might have
tidings of his arrival, yet so as that none else might wot aught thereof, she adopted the
device of lowering a pack-thread from the bedroom window on such wise that, while with one
end it should all but touch the ground, it should traverse the floor of the room, until it
reached the bed, and then be brought under the clothes, so that, when she was abed, she
might attach it to her great toe. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080009"/>Having so done, she sent word to Ruberto,
that when he came, he must be sure to jerk the pack-thread, and, if her husband were
asleep, she would loose it, and go open to him; but, if he were awake, she would hold it
taut and draw it to herself, to let him know that he must not expect
her. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080010"/>Ruberto fell in with the idea, came there many
times, and now forgathered with her and again did not. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080011"/>But at last, they still
using this cunning practice, it so befell that one night, while the lady slept,
Arriguccio, letting his foot stray more than he was wont about the bed, came upon the
pack-thread, and laying his hand upon it, found that it was attached to his lady's great
toe, and said to himself: This must be some trick: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080012"/>and afterwards discovering
that the thread passed out of the window, was confirmed in his surmise. Wherefore, he
softly severed it from the lady's toe, and <pb n="153"/>affixed it to his own; and waited,
all attention, to learn the result of his experiment. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080013"/>Nor had he long to wait
before Ruberto came, and Arriguccio felt him jerk the thread according to his wont: and as
Arriguccio had not known how to attach the thread securely, and Ruberto jerked it with
some force, it gave way, whereby he understood that he was to wait, and did
so. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080014"/>Arriguccio straightway arose, caught up his arms, and hasted to the door to
see who might be there, intent to do him a mischief. Now Arriguccio, for all he was a
merchant, was a man of spirit, and of thews and sinews; and being
come to the door, he opened it by no means gingerly, as the lady was wont; whereby
Ruberto, who was in waiting, surmised the truth, to wit, that 'twas Arriguccio by whom the
door was opened.  Wherefore he forthwith took to flight, followed by
Arriguccio. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080015"/>But at length, when he had run a long way, as Arriguccio gave not
up the pursuit, he being also armed, drew his sword, and faced about; and so they fell to,
Arriguccio attacking, and Ruberto defending himself.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080016"/>Now when Arriguccio undid the
bedroom door, the lady awoke, and finding the pack-thread cut loose from her toe, saw at a
glance that her trick was discovered; and hearing Arriguccio running after Ruberto, she
forthwith got up, foreboding what the result was like to be, and called her maid, who was
entirely in her confidence:
whom she so plied with her obsecrations that at last she got her into bed in her room,
beseeching her not to say who she was, but to bear patiently all the blows that Arriguccio
might give her; and she would so reward her that she should have no reason to complain.
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080017"/>Then, extinguishing the light that was in the room, forth she hied her, and
having found a convenient hiding-place in the house, awaited the turn of
events. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080018"/>Now Arriguccio and Ruberto being hotly engaged in the street, the
neighbours, roused by the din of the combat, got up and launched their curses upon
them. Wherefore
Arriguccio, fearing lest he should be recognized, drew off before he had so much as
discovered who the young gallant was, or done him any scathe, and in a fell and wrathful
mood betook him home.  Stumbling into the bedroom, he cried out angrily: <q>Where art
thou, lewd woman? Thou hast put out the light, that I may not be able to find thee; but
thou hast miscalculated.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080019"/>And going to the bedside, he laid hold of the
maid, taking her to be his wife, <pb n="154"/>and fell a pummelling and kicking her with
all the strength he had in his hands and feet, insomuch that he pounded her face well-nigh
to pulp, rating her the while like the vilest woman that ever was; and last of all he cut
off her hair. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080020"/>The maid wept bitterly, as indeed she well might; and though from
time to time she ejaculated an <q>Alas! Mercy, for God's sake!</q> or <q>Spare me, spare
me;</q> yet her voice was so broken by her sobs, and Arriguccio's hearing so dulled by his
wrath, that he was not able to discern that 'twas not
his wife's voice but that of another woman. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080021"/>So, having soundly thrashed her,
and cut off her hair, as we said: <q>Wicked woman,</q> quoth he, <q>I touch thee no more;
but I go to find thy brothers, and shall do them to wit of thy good works; and then they
may come here, and deal with thee as they may deem their honour demands, and take thee
hence, for be sure thou shalt no more abide in this house.</q> With this he was gone,
locking the door of the room behind him, and quitted the house alone.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080022"/>Now no sooner
did Monna Sismonda, who had heard all that passed, perceive that her husband was gone,
than she opened the door of the bedroom, rekindled the light, and finding her maid all
bruises and tears, did what she could to comfort her, and carried her back to her own
room, where, causing her to be privily waited on and tended, she helped her so liberally
from Arriguccio's own store, that she confessed herself content. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080023"/>The maid thus
bestowed in her room, the lady presently hied her back to her own, which she set all in
neat and trim order, remaking the bed, so that it might
appear as if it had not been slept in, relighting the lamp, and dressing
and tiring herself, until she looked as if she had not been abed that
night; then, taking with her a lighted lamp and some work, she sat her down at the head of
the stairs, and began sewing, while she waited to see how the affair would end.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080024"/>Arriguccio meanwhile had hied him with all speed straight from the house to that of his
wife's brothers, where by dint of much knocking he made himself heard, and was
admitted. The lady's
three brothers, and her mother, being informed that 'twas Arriguccio, got up, and having
set lights a burning, came to him and asked him on what errand he was come there at that
hour, and alone. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080025"/>Whereupon Arriguccio, beginning with the discovery of the
pack-thread attached to his lady's great toe, gave them the whole <pb n="155"/>narrative of
his discoveries and doings down to the very end; and to clinch the whole matter, he put in
their hands the locks which he had cut, as he believed, from his wife's head, adding that
'twas now for them to come for her and deal with her on such wise as they might deem their
honour required, seeing that he would nevermore have her in his house. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080026"/>Firmly
believing what he told them, the lady's brothers were very wroth with her, and having
provided themselves with lighted torches, set out with Arriguccio, and hied them to his
house with intent to scorn her, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080027"/>while their mother followed, weeping and
beseeching now one, now another, not to credit these matters so hastily, until they had
seen or heard somewhat more thereof; for that the husband might have some other reason to
be wroth with her, and having ill-treated her, might have trumped up this charge by way of
exculpation, adding that, if true, 'twas passing strange, for well she knew her daughter,
whom she had brought up from her tenderest years, and much more to the like
effect.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080028"/>However, being come to Arriguccio's house, they entered, and were mounting
the stairs, when Monna Sismonda, hearing them, called out: <q>Who is there?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080029"/>Whereto one of the brothers responded: <q>Lewd woman, thou shalt soon have
cause enough to know who it is.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080030"/><q>Now Lord love us!</q> quoth Monna
Sismonda, <q>what would he be at?</q> Then, rising, she greeted them with: <q>Welcome, my
brothers; but what seek ye abroad at this hour, all three of you?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080031"/>They had
seen her sitting and sewing with never a sign of a blow on her face, whereas Arriguccio
had averred that he had pummelled her all over: wherefore their first impression was one
of wonder, and refraining the vehemence of their wrath, they asked her what might be the
truth of the matter which Arriguccio
laid to her charge, and threatened her with direful consequences, if she should conceal
aught. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080032"/>Whereto the lady: <q>What you would have me tell you,</q> quoth she,
<q>or what Arriguccio may have laid to my charge, that know not I.</q> Arriguccio could
but gaze upon her, as one that had taken leave of his wits, calling to mind how he had
pummelled her about the face times without number, and scratched it for her, and
mishandled her in all manner of ways, and there he now saw her with no trace of aught of
it all upon her. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080033"/>However, to make a long story short, the lady's brothers told
her what Arriguccio <pb n="156"/>had told them touching the pack-thread and the beating and
all the rest of it. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080034"/>Whereupon the lady turned to him with: <q>Alas, my husband,
what is this that I hear? Why givest thou me, to thy own great shame, the reputation of a
lewd woman, when such I am not, and thyself the reputation of a wicked and cruel man,
which thou art not? Wast thou ever to-night, I say not in my company, but so much as in
the house until now? Or when didst thou beat me?  For my part I mind me not of it.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080035"/>Arriguccio began: <q>How sayst thou, lewd woman? Did we not go to bed together?
Did I not come back, after chasing thy lover? Did I not give thee bruises not a few, and
cut thy hair for thee?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080036"/>But the lady interrupted him, saying: <q>Nay, thou
didst not lie here to-night. But leave we this, of which my true words are my sole
witness, and pass we to this of the beating thou sayst thou gavest me, and how thou didst
cut my hair. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080037"/>Never a beating had I from thee, and I bid all that are here, and
thee among them, look at me, and say if I have any trace of a beating on my person; nor
should I advise thee to dare lay hand upon me; for, by the Holy Rood, I would spoil thy
beauty for thee. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080038"/>Nor didst thou cut my hair, for aught that I saw or felt:
however, thou didst it, perchance, on such wise that I was not ware thereof: so let me see
whether 'tis cut or no.</q> Then, unveiling herself, she shewed that her hair was uncut
and entire. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080039"/>Wherefore her brothers and mother now turned to Arriguccio with:
<q>What means this, Arriguccio? This accords not with what thou gavest us
to understand thou hadst done; nor know we how thou wilt prove the residue.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080040"/>Arriguccio was lost, as it were, in a dream, and yet he would fain have spoken; but,
seeing that what he had thought to prove was
otherwise, he essayed no reply. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080041"/>So the lady turning to her brothers: <q>I
see,</q> quoth she, <q>what he would have: he will not be satisfied unless I do what I
never would otherwise have done, to wit, give you to know what a pitiful caitiff he is; as
now I shall not fail to do.  I make no manner of doubt that, as he has said, even so it
befell, and so he did. How, you shall hear. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080042"/>This worthy man, to whom, worse
luck! you gave me to wife, a merchant, as he calls himself, and as such would fain have
credit, and who ought to be more temperate than a religious, and more continent than a
girl, lets scarce an evening pass but he goes a boozing in the taverns, and consorting 
<pb n="157"/>with this or the other woman of the town; and 'tis for me to await his return
until midnight or sometimes until matins, even as you now find me. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080043"/>I doubt not
that, being thoroughly well drunk, he got him to bed with one of these wantons, and,
awaking, found the packthread on her foot, and afterwards did actually perform all these
brave exploits of which he speaks, and in the end came back to her, and
beat her, and cut her hair off, and being not yet quite recovered from his debauch,
believed, and, I doubt not, still believes, that 'twas I that he thus treated; and if you
will but scan his face closely, you will see that he is still half drunk. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080044"/>But,
whatever he may have said about me, I would have you account it as nothing more than the
disordered speech of a tipsy man; and forgive him as I do.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080045"/>Whereupon the
lady's mother raised no small outcry, saying: <q>By the Holy Rood, my daughter, this may
not be! A daughter, such as thou, to be mated with one so unworthy of thee! The pestilent,
insensate cur should be slain on the spot! A pretty state of things, indeed! Why, he might
have picked thee up from the gutter! <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080046"/>Now foul fall him!  but thou shalt no more
be vexed with the tedious drivel of a petty dealer in ass's dung, some blackguard, belike,
that came hither from the country because he was dismissed the service of some petty
squire, clad in romagnole, with belfry-breeches, and a pen in his arse, and, for that he
has a few pence, must needs have a gentleman's daughter,
and a fine lady to wife, and set up a coat of arms, and say: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080047"/>'I am of the such
and such,' and 'my ancestors did thus and thus.' Ah!  had my sons but followed my advice!
Thy honour were safe in the house of the Counts Guidi, where they might have bestowed
thee, though thou hadst but a morsel of bread to thy dowry: but they must needs give thee
to this rare treasure, who, though better daughter and more chaste there is none than thou
in <placeName>Florence</placeName>, has not blushed this very midnight and in our presence to call thee a
strumpet, as if we knew thee not. God's faith! so I were hearkened
to, he should shrewdly smart for it.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080048"/>Then, turning to her sons, she said:
<q>My sons, I told you plainly enough that this ought not to be.  Now, have you heard how
your worthy brother-in-law treats your sister?  Petty twopenny trader that he is: were it
for me to act, as it is for you, after what he has said of her and done to her, nought
would satisfy or appease me, till I had rid the earth of him. And were I a man, who am but
a woman, none other but <pb n="158"/>myself should meddle with the affair.  God's curse
upon him, the woeful, shameless sot!</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080049"/>Whereupon the young men, incensed by
what they had seen and heard, turned to Arriguccio, and after giving him the soundest
rating that ever was bestowed upon caitiff, concluded as follows: <q>This once we pardon
thee, witting thee to be a drunken knave: but as thou holdest thy life dear, have a care
that
henceforth we hear no such tales of thee; for rest assured that if aught of the kind do
reach our ears, we will requite thee for both turns.</q> Which said, they
departed. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07080050"/>Arriguccio, standing there like one dazed, not witting whether his
late doings were actual fact or but a dream, made no more words about the matter, but left
his wife in peace. Thus did she by her address not only escape imminent peril, but open a
way whereby in time to come she was able to gratify her passion to the full without any
farther fear of her husband.</p></div><pb n="159"/><!--***********************************Novella 9*********************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0709"><head>Novel IX</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090001"/><!--(i)-->Lydia, wife of

	far more to the favour of Fortune than to the guidance of reason: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090004"/>wherefore I
	should not advise any of you rashly to follow in her footsteps, seeing

time is out of all proportion to its size, there dwelt of yore Nicostratus, a nobleman, to
whom, when he was already verging on old age, Fortune gave to wife a great lady, Lydia by
name, whose courage matched her charms. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090006"/>Nicostratus, as suited with his rank
and wealth, kept not a few retainers and hounds and hawks, and was
mightily addicted to the chase. Among his dependants was a young man named Pyrrhus, a
gallant of no mean accomplishment, and goodly of person and beloved and trusted by
Nicostratus above all <pb n="160"/>other. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090007"/>Of whom Lydia grew mighty enamoured,
insomuch that neither by day nor by night might her thoughts stray from him: but, whether
it was that Pyrrhus wist not her love, or would have none of it, he gave no sign of
recognition; whereby the lady's suffering waxing more than she could bear, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090008"/>she
made up her mind to declare her love to him; and having a chambermaid, <persName>Lusca</persName> by name, in
whom she placed great trust, she called her, and said: <q><persName>Lusca</persName>,
tokens thou hast had from me of my regard that should ensure thy obedience and loyalty;
wherefore have a care that what I shall now tell thee reach the ears of none but him to
whom I shall bid thee impart it. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090009"/>Thou seest, <persName>Lusca</persName>, that I am in the prime of
my youth and lustihead, and have neither lack nor stint of all such things as folk desire,
save only, to be brief, that I have one cause to repine, to wit, that my husband's years
so far outnumber my own. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090010"/>Wherefore with that wherein young ladies take most
pleasure I am but ill provided, and, as my desire is no less than theirs, 'tis now some
while since I determined that, if Fortune has shewn herself so little friendly to me by
giving me a husband so advanced in years, at least I will not be mine own enemy by sparing
to devise the means whereby my happiness and health may be assured; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090011"/>and that
herein, as in all other
matters, my joy may be complete, I have chosen, thereto to minister by his embraces, our
Pyrrhus, deeming him more worthy than any other man, and have so set my heart upon him
that I am ever ill at ease save when he is present either to my sight or to my mind,
insomuch that, unless I forgather with him without delay, I doubt not that 'twill be the
death of me. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090012"/>And so, if thou holdest my life dear, thou wilt shew him my love
on such wise as thou mayst deem best, and make my suit to him that he be pleased to come
to me, when thou shalt go to fetch him.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090013"/><q>That gladly will I,</q> replied
the chambermaid; and as soon as she found convenient time and place, she drew Pyrrhus
apart, and, as best she knew how, conveyed her lady's message to him. Which Pyrrhus found
passing strange to hear, for 'twas in truth a complete surprise to him, and he doubted
the lady did but mean to try him. Wherefore he presently, and with some asperity, answered
thus: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090014"/><q><persName>Lusca</persName>, believe I cannot that this message comes from my lady: have a
care, therefore, what thou sayst, and if, perchance, it does come from her, I doubt she
does not mean it; and if, perchance, she does mean it, why, then I am <pb n="161"/>honoured
by my lord above what I deserve, and I would not for my life do him such a wrong: so have
a care never to speak of such matters to me again.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090015"/><persName>Lusca</persName>, nowise
disconcerted by his uncompliant tone, rejoined: <q>I shall speak to thee, Pyrrhus, of
these and all other matters, wherewith I may be commissioned by my lady, as often as she
shall bid me, whether it pleases or irks thee; but thou art a blockhead.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090016"/>So,
somewhat chafed, <persName>Lusca</persName> bore Pyrrhus' answer back to her lady, who would fain have died,
when she heard it, and some days afterwards resumed the topic, saying: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090017"/><q>Thou
knowest, <persName>Lusca</persName>, that 'tis not the first stroke that fells the oak; wherefore, methinks,
thou wert best go back to this strangeman, who is minded to evince his loyalty at my
expense, and choosing a convenient time, declare to him all my passion, and do thy best
endeavour that the affair be carried through; for if it should thus lapse, 'twould be the
death of me; besides which, he would think we had but trifled with him, and, whereas 'tis
his love we would have, we should earn his hatred.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090018"/>So, after comforting the
lady, the maid hied her in quest of Pyrrhus,
whom she found in a gladsome and propitious mood, and thus addressed: <q>'Tis not many
days, Pyrrhus, since I declared to thee how ardent is the flame with which thy lady and
mine is consumed for love of thee, and now again I do thee to wit thereof, and that, if
thou shalt not relent of the harshness that thou didst manifest the other day, thou mayst
rest assured that her life will be short: wherefore I pray thee to be pleased to give her
solace of her desire, and shouldst thou persist in thy obduracy, I, that gave thee credit
for not a little sense, shall deem thee a great fool. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090019"/>How flattered thou
shouldst be to know thyself beloved above all else by a lady so beauteous and high-born!
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090020"/>And how indebted shouldst thou feel thyself to Fortune, seeing that she has in
store for thee a boon so great and so suited to the cravings of thy youth, ay, and so like
to be of service to thee upon occasion of need! <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090021"/>Bethink thee, if there be any
of thine equals whose life is ordered more agreeably than thine will be if thou but be
wise. Which of them wilt thou find so well furnished with arms and horses, clothes and
money as thou shalt be, if thou but give my lady thy love? <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090022"/>Receive, then, my
words with open mind; be thyself again; bethink thee that 'tis Fortune's way to confront a
man but once with smiling mien and open lap, and, if he <pb n="162"/>then accept not her
bounty, he has but himself to blame, if afterward he find himself in want, in
beggary. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090023"/>Besides which, no such loyalty is demanded between servants and their
masters as between friends and kinsfolk; rather 'tis for servants, so far as they may, to
behave towards their masters as their masters behave towards them. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090024"/>Thinkest
thou, that, if thou hadst a fair wife or mother or daughter or sister that found favour in
Nicostratus' eyes, he would be so scrupulous on the point of loyalty as thou art disposed
to be in regard of his lady?  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090025"/>Thou art a fool, if so thou dost believe. Hold it
for certain, that, if blandishments and supplications did not suffice, he would, whatever
thou mightest think of it, have recourse to force. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090026"/>Observe we, then, towards
them and theirs the same rule which they observe towards us and ours. Take the boon that
Fortune offers thee; repulse her not; rather go thou to meet her, and hail her advance;
for be sure that, if thou do not so, to say nought of thy lady's death, which will
certainly ensue, thou thyself wilt repent thee thereof so often that
thou wilt be fain of death.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090027"/>Since he had last seen <persName>Lusca</persName>, Pyrrhus had
repeatedly pondered what she had said to him, and had made his mind up that, should she
come again, he would answer her in another sort, and comply in all respects with the
lady's desires, provided he might be assured that she was not merely putting him to the
proof; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090028"/>wherefore he now made answer: <q>Lo, now, <persName>Lusca</persName>, I acknowledge the truth
of all that thou
sayst; but, on the other hand, I know that my lord is not a little wise and wary, and, as
he has committed all his affairs to my charge, I sorely misdoubt me that 'tis with his
approbation, and by his advice, and but to prove me, that Lydia does this:
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090029"/>wherefore let her do three things which I shall demand of her for my assurance,
and then there is nought that she shall crave of me, but I will certainly render her
prompt obedience. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090030"/>Which three things are these: first, let her in Nicostratus'
presence kill his fine sparrow-hawk: then she must send me a lock of Nicostratus' beard,
and lastly one of his best teeth.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090031"/>Hard seemed these terms to <persName>Lusca</persName>, and
hard beyond measure to the lady, but Love, that great fautor of enterprise, and master of
stratagem, gave her resolution to address herself to their performance: wherefore through
the chambermaid she sent him word that what he required of her she would do, and that
without either reservation or delay; and therewithal she told him, that, as he deemed
Nicostratus so wise, she <pb n="163"/>would contrive that they should enjoy one another in
Nicostratus' presence, and that Nicostratus should believe that 'twas a mere show.
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090032"/>Pyrrhus, therefore, anxiously expected what the lady would do. Some days thus
passed, and then Nicostratus gave a great breakfast, as was his frequent wont, to certain
gentlemen, and when the tables were removed, the lady, robed in green samite, and richly
adorned, came forth of her chamber into the hall wherein they sate, and before the eyes of
Pyrrhus and all the rest of the company hied her to the perch, on which stood the
sparrow-hawk that Nicostratus so much prized, and loosed him, and, as if she were minded
to carry him on her hand, took him by the jesses and dashed him against the wall so that
he died. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090033"/>Whereupon: <q>Alas! my lady, what hast thou done?</q> exclaimed
Nicostratus: but she vouchsafed no answer, save that,
turning to the gentlemen that had sate at meat with him, she said: <q>My lords, ill fitted
were I to take vengeance on a king that had done me despite, if I lacked the courage to be
avenged on a sparrowhawk.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090034"/>You are to know that by this bird I have long been
cheated of all the time that ought to be devoted by gentlemen to pleasuring their ladies;
for with the first streaks of dawn Nicostratus has been up and got him to horse, and hawk
on hand hied him to the champaign to see him fly, leaving me, such as you see me, alone
and ill content abed. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090035"/>For which cause I have oftentimes been minded to do that
which I have now done, and have only refrained therefrom, that, biding my time, I might do
it in the presence of men that should judge my cause justly, as I trust you will do.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090036"/>Which hearing, the gentlemen, who deemed her affections no less fixed on
Nicostratus than her words imported, broke with one accord into a laugh,
and turning to Nicostratus, who was sore displeased, fell a saying: <q>Now well done of
the lady to avenge her wrongs by the death of the sparrow-hawk!</q> and so, the lady being
withdrawn to her chamber, they passed the affair off with divers pleasantries, turning the
wrath of Nicostratus to laughter.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090037"/>Pyrrhus, who had witnessed what had passed, said
to himself: Nobly indeed has my lady begun, and on such wise as promises well for the
felicity of my love. God grant that she so continue.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090038"/>And even so Lydia did:
for not many days after she had killed the
sparrow-hawk, she, being with Nicostratus in her chamber, from caressing passed to toying
and trifling with him, and he, sportively <pb n="164"/>pulling her by the hair, gave her
occasion to fulfil the second of
Pyrrhus' demands; which she did by nimbly laying hold of one of the lesser tufts of his
beard, and, laughing the while, plucking it so hard that she tore it out of his
chin. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090039"/>Which Nicostratus somewhat resenting: <q>Now what cause hast thou,</q>
quoth she, <q>to make such a wry face? 'Tis but that I have plucked some half-dozen hairs
from thy beard. Thou didst not feel it as much as did I but now thy tugging of my
hair.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090040"/>And so they continued jesting and sporting with one another, the lady
jealously guarding the tuft that she had torn from the beard, which the very same day she
sent to her cherished lover. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090041"/>The third demand caused the lady more thought;
but, being amply endowed with wit, and powerfully seconded
by Love, she failed not to hit upon an apt expedient.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090042"/>Nicostratus had in his service two lads, who, being of gentle birth, had been placed
with him by their kinsfolk, that they might learn manners, one of whom, when Nicostratus
sate at meat, carved before him, while the other gave him to drink. Both lads Lydia called
to her, and gave them to understand that their breath smelt, and admonished them that,
when they waited on Nicostratus, they should hold their heads as far back as possible,
saying never a word of the matter to any. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090043"/>The lads believing her, did as she
bade them. Whereupon she took occasion to say to Nicostratus: <q>Hast thou marked what
these lads do when they wait upon thee?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090044"/><q>Troth, that have I,</q> replied
Nicostratus; <q>indeed I have often had it in mind to ask them why they do so.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090045"/><q>Nay,</q> rejoined the lady, <q>spare thyself the pains; for I can tell thee
the reason, which I have for some time kept close, lest it should vex thee; but as I now
see that others begin to be ware of it, it need no longer be withheld from
thee. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090046"/>'Tis for that thy breath stinks shrewdly that they thus avert their heads
from thee: 'twas not wont to be so, nor know I why it should be so; and 'tis most
offensive when thou art in converse with gentlemen; and therefore 'twould be well to find
some way of curing it.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090047"/><q>I wonder what it could be,</q> returned
Nicostratus; <q>is it perchance that I have a decayed tooth in my jaw?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090048"/><q>That may well be,</q> quoth Lydia: and taking him to a window, she caused
him open his mouth, and after regarding it on this side and that: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090049"/><q>Oh!
Nicostratus,</q> quoth she, <q>how couldst thou have endured it so long? Thou hast a tooth
here, <pb n="165"/>which, by what I see, is not only decayed, but actually rotten
throughout; and beyond all manner of doubt, if thou let it remain long in thy head, 'twill
infect its neighbours; so 'tis my advice that thou out with it before the matter grows
worse.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090050"/><q>My judgment jumps with thine,</q> quoth Nicostratus; <q>wherefore
send without delay for a chirurgeon to draw it.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090051"/><q>God forbid,</q> returned
the lady, <q>that chirurgeon come hither for such a purpose; methinks, the case is such
that I can very well dispense with him, and draw the tooth myself. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090052"/>Besides
which, these chirurgeons do these things in such a cruel way, that I could never endure to
see thee or know thee under the hands of any of them: wherefore my mind is quite made up
to do it myself, that, at least, if thou shalt suffer too much, I may give it over at
once, as a chirurgeon would not do.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090053"/>And so she caused the instruments that
are used on such occasions to be brought her, and having dismissed all other attendants
save <persName>Lusca</persName> from the chamber, and locked the door, made Nicostratus lie down on a table,
set the pincers in his mouth, and clapped them on one of his teeth, which, while <persName>Lusca</persName>
held him, so that, albeit he roared for pain, he might not move, she wrenched by main
force from his jaw, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090054"/>and keeping it close, took from <persName>Lusca</persName>'s hand another and
horribly decayed tooth, which she shewed him, suffering and half dead as he was, saying:
<q>See what thou hadst in thy jaw; mark how far gone it is.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090055"/>Believing what
she said, and deeming that, now the tooth was out, his breath would no more be offensive,
and being somewhat eased of the pain, which had been extreme, and still remained, so that
he murmured not little, by divers comforting applications, he quitted the chamber:
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090056"/>whereupon the lady forthwith sent the tooth to her lover, who, having now full
assurance of her love, placed himself entirely at her service. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090057"/>But the lady
being
minded to make his assurance yet more sure, and deeming each hour a thousand till she
might be with him, now saw fit, for the more ready performance of the promise she had
given him, to feign sickness; and Nicostratus, coming to see her one day after breakfast,
attended only by Pyrrhus, she besought him for her better solacement, to help her down to
the garden. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090058"/>Wherefore Nicostratus on one side, and Pyrrhus on the other, took
her and bore her down to the garden, and set her on a lawn at the foot of a beautiful
pear-tree: and after they had sate there a while, the lady, who had already <pb n="166"/>given Pyrrhus to understand what he must do, said to him: <q>Pyrrhus, I should
greatly like to have some of those pears; get thee up the tree, and shake some of them
down.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090059"/>Pyrrhus climbed the tree in a trice, and began to shake down the
pears, and while he did so: <q>Fie! Sir,</q> quoth he, <q>what is this you do? And you,
Madam, have you no shame, that you suffer him to do so in my presence?  Think you that I
am blind? 'Twas but now that you were gravely indisposed.  Your cure has been speedy
indeed to permit of your so behaving: and as for such a purpose you have so many goodly
chambers, why betake you not yourselves to one of them, if you must needs so disport
yourselves?  'Twould be much more decent than to do so in my presence.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090060"/>Whereupon the lady, turning to her husband: <q>Now what can Pyrrhus mean?</q>
said she. <q>Is he mad?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090061"/><q>Nay, Madam,</q> quoth Pyrrhus; <q>mad am not I.
Think you I see you not?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090062"/>Whereat Nicostratus marvelled not a little; and:
<q>Pyrrhus,</q> quoth he, <q>I verily believe thou dreamest.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090063"/><q>Nay, my
lord,</q> replied Pyrrhus, <q>not a whit do I dream; neither do you; rather you wag it
with such vigour, that, if this pear-tree did the like, there would be never a pear left
on it.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090064"/>Then the lady: <q>What can this mean?</q> quoth she: <q>can it be
that it really seems to him to be as he says? Upon my hope of salvation, were I but in my
former health, I would get me up there to judge for myself what these wonders are which he
professes to see.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090065"/>Whereupon, as Pyrrhus in the pear-tree continued talking
in the same strange strain: <q>Come down,</q> quoth Nicostratus;
and when he was down: <q>Now what,</q> said Nicostratus, <q>is it thou sayst thou seest up
there?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090066"/><q>I suppose,</q> replied Pyrrhus, <q>that you take me to be deluded
or dreaming: but as I must needs tell you the truth, I saw you lying upon your wife, and
then, when I came down, I saw you get up and sit you down here where you now are.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090067"/><q>Therein,</q> said Nicostratus, <q>thou wast certainly deluded, for, since
thou clombest the pear-tree, we have not budged a jot, save as thou seest.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090068"/>Then said Pyrrhus: <q>Why make more words about the matter? See you I certainly
did; and, seeing you, I saw you lying upon your own.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090069"/>Nicostratus' wonder
now waxed momently, insomuch that he said: <q>I am minded to see if this
pear-tree be enchanted, so that whoso is in it sees marvels;</q> and so he got him up into
it. Whereupon the lady and Pyrrhus fell <pb n="167"/>to disporting them, and Nicostratus,
seeing what they were about, exclaimed: <q>Ah! lewd woman, what is this thou doest? And
thou, Pyrrhus, in whom I so much trusted!</q> And so saying, he began to climb
down. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090070"/>Meanwhile the lady and Pyrrhus had made answer: <q>We are sitting
here:</q> and seeing him descending, they placed themselves as they had been when he had
left them, whom Nicostratus, being come down, no sooner saw, than he fell a
rating them. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090071"/>Then quoth Pyrrhus: <q>Verily, Nicostratus, I now acknowledge,
that, as you said a while ago, what I saw when I was in the pear-tree was but a false
show, albeit I had never understood that so it was but that I now see and know that thou
hast also seen a false show. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090072"/>And that I speak truth, you may sufficiently
assure yourself, if you but reflect whether 'tis likely that your wife, who for virtue and
discretion has not her peer among women, would, if she were minded so to dishonour you,
see fit to do so before your very eyes. Of myself I say nought, albeit I had liefer be
hewn in pieces than that I should so much as think of such a thing, much less do it in
your presence. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090073"/>Wherefore 'tis evident
that 'tis some illusion of sight that is propagated from the pear-tree;
for nought in the world would have made me believe that I saw not you lying there in
carnal intercourse with your wife, had I not heard you say that you saw me doing that
which most assuredly, so far from doing, I never so much as thought of.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090074"/>The
lady then started up with a most resentful mien, and burst out with: <q>Foul fall thee, if
thou knowest so little of me as to suppose that, if I were minded to do thee such foul
dishonour as thou sayst thou didst see me do, I would come hither to do it before thine
eyes! <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090075"/>Rest assured that for such a purpose, were it ever mine, I should deem
one of our chambers more meet, and it should go hard but I would so order the matter that
thou shouldst never know aught of it.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090076"/>Nicostratus, having heard both, and
deeming that what they both

averred must be true, to wit, that they would never have ventured upon such an act in his
presence, passed from chiding to talk of the

singularity of the thing, and how marvellous it was that the vision should reshape itself
for every one that clomb the tree. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090077"/>The lady, however, made a show of being
distressed that Nicostratus should so have thought of her, and: <q>Verily,</q> quoth she,
<q>no woman, neither I nor another, shall again suffer loss of honour by this <pb n="168"/>pear-tree: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090078"/>run, Pyrrhus, and bring hither an axe, and at one and the
same time vindicate thy honour and mine by felling it, albeit 'twere better far
Nicostratus' skull should feel the weight of the axe, seeing that in utter heedlessness he
so readily suffered the eyes of his mind to be blinded; for, albeit this vision was seen
by the bodily eye, yet ought the understanding by no means to have entertained and
affirmed it as real.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090079"/>So Pyrrhus presently hied him to fetch the axe, and
returning therewith felled the pear; whereupon the lady, turning towards Nicostratus:
<q>Now that this foe of my honour is fallen,</q> quoth she, <q>my wrath is gone from
me.</q> Nicostratus then craving her pardon, she graciously granted it him, bidding him
never again to suffer himself to be betrayed into thinking such a thing of her, who loved
him more dearly than herself. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07090080"/>So the poor duped husband went back with her and
her lover to the palace, where not seldom in time to come Pyrrhus and Lydia took their
pastime together more at ease. God grant us the like.</p></div><!--***********************************Novella 10*********************************--><pb n="169"/><div type="novella" corresp="nov0710"><head>Novel X</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07100001"/><!--(i)-->Two Sienese love a lady, one of them being

      fall. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07100004"/>For, indeed, when yesterday I made the law which governs our discourse of
      to-day, I thought not to-day to avail myself of my privilege, but to submit to the law, no
      less than you, and to discourse of the same topic whereof you all have discoursed;
      <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07100005"/>but not only has the very story
      been told which I had intended to tell, but therewithal so many things else, and so very
      much goodlier have been said, that, search my memory as I may, I cannot mind me of aught,
      nor wot I that touching such a matter there is indeed aught, for me to say, that would be
      comparable with what has been said; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07100006"/>wherefore, as infringe I must the law that
      I myself have made, I confess myself worthy of punishment, and instantly declaring my
      readiness to pay any forfeit that may be demanded of me, am minded to have recourse to my
      wonted privilege. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07100007"/>And such, dearest ladies, is the potency of Elisa's story of
      the godfather and his gossip, and therewith of the simplicity of the Sienese, that I am
      prompted thereby to pass from this topic of the beguilement of foolish husbands by their
      cunning wives to a
      <pb n="170"/>little story touching these same Sienese, which, albeit there is not a little
      therein which you were best not to believe, may yet be in
      some degree entertaining to hear.</p></body></floatingText><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07100008"/>Know, then, that at <placeName>Siena</placeName> there dwelt in Porta
Salaia two young men of the people, named, the one, Tingoccio Mini, the other Meuccio di
Tura, who, by what appeared, loved one another not a little, for they were scarce ever out
of one another's company; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07100009"/>and being wont, like other folk, to go to church and
listen to sermons, they heard from time to time of the glory and the woe, which in the
other world are allotted, according to merit, to the souls of the dead.  Of which matters
craving, but being unable to come by, more certain assurance, they agreed together that,
whichever of them should die first, should, if he might, return to the survivor, and
certify him of that which he would fain know; and this agreement they confirmed with an
oath. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07100010"/>Now, after they had made this engagement, and while they were still
constantly together, Tingoccio chanced to become sponsor to one Ambruogio Anselmini, that
dwelt in Campo Reggi, who had had a son by his wife, Monna Mita. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07100011"/>The lady was
exceeding fair, and amorous withal, and Tingoccio being wont sometimes to visit her as his
gossip, and to take Meuccio with him, he,
notwithstanding his sponsorship, grew enamoured of her, as did also
Meuccio, for she pleased him not a little, and he heard her much commended by
Tingoccio. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07100012"/>Which love each concealed from the other; but not for the same
reason. Tingoccio was averse to discover it to Meuccio, for that he deemed it an
ignominious thing to love his gossip, and was ashamed to let any one know it. Meuccio was
on his guard for a very different reason, to wit, that he was already ware that the lady
was in Tingoccio's good graces. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07100013"/>Wherefore he said to himself: If I avow my love
to him, he will be jealous of me, and as, being her gossip, he can speak with her as
often as he pleases, he will do all he can to make her hate me, and so I shall never have
any favour of her.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07100014"/>Now, the two young men being thus, as I have said, on terms of
most familiar friendship, it befell that Tingoccio, being the better able to open his
heart to the lady, did so order his demeanour and discourse that he had from her all that
he desired. Nor was his friend's success hidden from Meuccio; though, much as it vexed
him, yet still cherishing the hope of eventually attaining his end, and <pb n="171"/>
fearing to give Tingoccio occasion to baulk or hamper him in some way, he feigned
to know nought of the matter. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07100015"/>So Tingoccio, more fortunate than his comrade,
and rival in love, did with such assiduity till his gossip's good land that he got thereby
a malady, which in the course of some days waxed so grievous that he succumbed thereto,
and departed this life. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07100016"/>And on the night of the third day after his
decease (perchance because earlier he might not) he made his appearance,
according to his promise, in Meuccio's chamber, and called Meuccio, who was fast asleep,
by his name. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07100017"/>Whereupon: <q>Who art thou?</q> quoth Meuccio, as he
awoke. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07100018"/><q>'Tis I, Tingoccio,</q> replied he, <q>come back, in fulfilment of the
pledge I gave thee, to give thee tidings of the other world.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07100019"/>For a while
Meuccio saw him not without terror: then, his courage reviving: <q>Welcome, my
brother,</q> quoth he: and proceeded to ask him if he were lost.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07100020"/><q>Nought is
lost but what is irrecoverable,</q> replied Tingoccio: <q>how then should I be here, if I
were lost?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07100021"/><q>Nay,</q> quoth then Meuccio; <q>I mean it not so: I would
know of thee, whether thou art of the number of the souls that are condemned to the penal
fire of hell.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07100022"/><q>Why no,</q> returned Tingoccio, <q>not just that; but
still for the sins that I did I am in most sore and grievous torment.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07100023"/>Meuccio then questioned Tingoccio in detail of the pains there meted out for
each of the sins done here; and Tingoccio enumerated them all.  Whereupon Meuccio asked if
there were aught he might do for him
here on earth. Tingoccio answered in the affirmative; to wit, that he might have masses
and prayers said and alms-deeds done for him, for that such things were of great service
to the souls there. <q>That gladly will I,</q> replied Meuccio; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07100024"/>and then, as
Tingoccio was about to take his leave, he bethought him of the gossip, and raising his
head a little, he said: <q>I mind me, Tingoccio, of the gossip, with whom thou wast wont
to lie when thou wast here. Now what is thy punishment for that?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07100025"/><q>My
brother,</q> returned Tingoccio, <q>as soon as I got down there, I met one that seemed to
know all my sins by heart, who bade me betake me to a place, where, while in direst
torment I bewept my sins, I found comrades not a few condemned to the same pains; and so,
standing there among them, and calling to mind what I had done with the gossip, and
foreboding in
requital thereof a much greater torment than had yet been allotted me, albeit I was in a
great and most vehement flame, I quaked for <pb n="172"/>fear in every part of
me. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07100026"/>Which one that was beside me observing:
'What,' quoth he, 'hast thou done more than the rest of us that are here, that thou
quakest thus as thou standest in the fire?' 'My friend,' quoth I, 'I am in mortal fear of
the doom that I expect for a great sin that I once committed.' <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07100027"/>He then asked
what sin it might be. ''Twas on this wise,' replied I: 'I lay with my gossip, and that so
much that I died thereof.'  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07100028"/>Whereat, he did but laugh, saying: 'Go to, fool,
make thy mind easy; for here there is no account taken of gossips.' Which completely
revived my drooping spirits.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07100029"/>'Twas now near daybreak: wherefore: <q>Adieu! Meuccio,</q> quoth his friend: <q>for
longer tarry with thee I may not;</q> and so he vanished. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07100030"/>As for Meuccio,
having learned that no account was taken of gossips in the other world, he began to laugh
at his own folly in that he had already spared divers such; and so, being quit of his
ignorance, he in that respect in course of time waxed wise.  Which matters had Fra Rinaldo
but known, he would not have
needed to go about syllogizing in order to bring his fair gossip to
pleasure him.</p></div><!--***********************************Conclusion*********************************--><div type="conclusion" corresp="d07conclu"><head>Conclusion</head><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07970001"/>The sun was westering, and a light breeze blew,

<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07970004"/>However, in lieu thereof, I will have every one take thought to tell of those

taking their several pastimes, they sped the hours with exceeding great delight until
supper-time. Which being come, they sat them down at table beside the little lake, and
there, while a thousand songsters charmed their ears, and a gentle breeze, that blew from
the environing hills, fanned them, and never a fly annoyed them, reposefully and joyously
they supped. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07970007"/>The tables removed, they roved a while about the pleasant vale,
and then, the sun being still high, for 'twas but half vespers, the queen gave the word,
and they wended their way back to their wonted abode, and going slowly, and beguiling the
way with quips and quirks without number upon divers matters, nor those alone of which
they had that day discoursed, they arrived, hard upon nightfall, at the goodly palace.
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p07970008"/>There, the short walk's fatigue dispelled by wines most cool and

	whom we are continually wronged without being able to retaliate, to
	wit, the priests, who have instituted a crusade against our wives, and
	deem that, when they have made conquest of one of them, they have
	done a work every whit as worthy of recompense by remission of sin
	and punishment as if they had brought the Soldan in chains to <placeName>Avignon</placeName>:
	<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08020004"/>in which respect 'tis not possible for the hapless laity to be
	even with them: howbeit they are as hot to make reprisals on the
	priests' mothers, sisters, mistresses, and daughters as the priests to
	attack their wives. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08020005"/>Wherefore I am minded to give you, as I may
	do in few words, the history of a rustic amour, the conclusion whereof
	was not a little laughable, nor barren of moral, for you may also
	gather therefrom, that 'tis not always well to believe everything
	that a priest says.</p></body></floatingText><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08020006"/>I say then, that at <placeName>Varlungo</placeName>, a village hard by here, as all of you,
 my ladies, should wot either of your own knowledge or by report,
 there dwelt a worthy priest, and doughty of body in the service of
 the ladies: who, albeit he was none too quick at his book, had no <pb n="181"/>lack
 of precious and blessed solecisms to edify his flock withal of a
 Sunday under the elm. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08020007"/>And when the men were out of doors, he
 would visit their wives as never a priest had done before him, bringing
 them feast-day gowns and holy water, and now and again a bit of
 candle, and giving them his blessing. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08020008"/>Now it so befell that among
 those of his fair parishioners whom he most affected the first place
 was at length taken by one Monna <persName>Belcolore</persName>, the wife of a husbandman
 that called himself Bentivegna del Mazzo. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08020009"/>And in good sooth
 she was a winsome and lusty country lass, brown as a berry and
 buxom enough, and fitter than e'er another for his mill. Moreover
 she had not her match in playing the tabret and singing: <title type="song">The
 borage is full sappy</title>,
      <!--*********note*********--><note>For this folk-song see <!--(i)-->Cantilene e Ballate,
	Strambotti e Madrigali,<!--(/i)--> ed.
	Carducci (1871), p. 60. The fragment there printed may be freely rendered
	as follows:
	<lg><l>The borage is full sappy,</l><l>And clusters red we see,</l><l>And my love would make me happy;</l><l>So that maiden give to me.</l></lg><lg><l>Ill set I find this dance,</l><l>And better might it be:</l><l>So, comrade mine, advance,</l><l>And, changing place with me,</l><l>Stand thou thy love beside.</l></lg></note> 
      <!--*********note*********-->
and in leading a brawl or a breakdown, no
 matter who might be next her, with a fair and dainty kerchief in her
 hand. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08020010"/>Which spells so wrought upon Master Priest, that for love
 of her he grew distracted, and did nought all day long but loiter
 about the village on the chance of catching sight of her. And if of
 a Sunday morning he espied her in church, he strove might and main
 to acquit himself of his <title type="song">Kyrie</title> and <title type="song">Sanctus</title> in the style of a great
 singer, albeit his performance was liker to the braying of an ass:
 whereas, if he saw her not, he scarce exerted himself at all. However,
 he managed with such discretion that neither Bentivegna del
 Mazzo nor any of the neighbours wist aught of his love. 
      <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08020011"/>And
 hoping thereby to ingratiate himself with Monna <persName>Belcolore</persName>, he from
 time to time would send her presents, now a clove of fresh garlic, the
 best in all the country-side, from his own garden, which he tilled with
 his own hands, and anon a basket of beans or a bunch of chives or
 shallots; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08020012"/>and, when he thought it might serve his turn, he would 
<pb n="182"/>give
 her a sly glance, and follow it up with a little amorous mocking
 and mowing, which she, with rustic awkwardness, feigned not to
 understand, and ever maintained her reserve, so that Master Priest
 made no headway.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08020013"/>Now it so befell that one day, when the priest at high noon was
 aimlessly gadding about the village, he encountered Bentivegna del
 Mazzo at the tail of a well laden ass, and greeted him, asking him
 whither he was going. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08020014"/><q>I'faith, Sir,</q> quoth Bentivegna, <q>for sure
 'tis to town I go, having an affair or two to attend to there; and I
 am taking these things to Ser Buonaccorri da Ginestreto, to get him
 to stand by me in I wot not what matter, whereof the justice
 o' th' coram has by his provoker served me with a pertrumpery
 summons to appear before him.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08020015"/>Whereupon: <q>'Tis well, my
 son,</q> quoth the priest, overjoyed, <q>my blessing go with thee: good
 luck to thee and a speedy return; and harkye, shouldst thou see
 <persName>Lapuccio</persName> or <persName>Naldino</persName>, do not forget to tell them to send me those
 thongs for my flails.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08020016"/><q>It shall be done,</q> quoth Bentivegna, and
 jogged on towards <placeName>Florence</placeName>, while the priest, thinking that now was
 his time to hie him to <persName>Belcolore</persName> and try his fortune, put his best
 leg forward, and stayed not till he was at the house, which entering,
 he said: <q>God be gracious to us! Who is within?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08020017"/><persName>Belcolore</persName>,
 who was up in the loft, made answer: <q>Welcome, Sir; but what
 dost thou, gadding about in the heat?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08020018"/><q>Why, as I hope for
 God's blessing,</q> quoth he, <q>I am just come to stay with thee a
 while, having met thy husband on his way to town.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08020019"/>Whereupon
 down came <persName>Belcolore</persName>, took a seat, and began sifting cabbage-seed
 that her husband had lately threshed. By and by the priest began:
 <q>So, <persName>Belcolore</persName>, wilt thou keep me ever a dying thus?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08020020"/>Whereat
 <persName>Belcolore</persName> tittered, and said: <q>Why, what is't I do to you?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08020021"/><q>Truly, nothing at all,</q> replied the priest: <q>but thou sufferest me
 not to do to thee that which I had lief, and which God commands.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08020022"/><q>Now away with you!</q> returned <persName>Belcolore</persName>, <q>do priests do that
 sort of thing?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08020023"/><q>Indeed we do,</q> quoth the priest, <q>and to better
 purpose than others: why not? I tell you our grinding is far
 better; and wouldst thou know why? 'tis because 'tis intermittent.
 And in truth 'twill be well worth thy while to keep thine own
 counsel, and let me do it.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08020024"/><q>Worth my while!</q> ejaculated
 <persName>Belcolore</persName>. <q>How may that be? There is never a one of you but <pb n="183"/>would
 overreach the very Devil.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08020025"/><q>'Tis not for me to say,</q>
 returned the priest; <q>say but what thou wouldst have: shall it be
 a pair of dainty shoes? Or wouldst thou prefer a fillet? Or
 perchance a gay riband? What's thy will?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08020026"/><q>Marry, no lack
 have I,</q> quoth <persName>Belcolore</persName>, <q>of such things as these. But, if you
 wish me so well, why do me not a service? and I would then be
 at your command.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08020027"/><q>Name but the service,</q> returned the priest,
 <q>and gladly will I do it.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08020028"/>Quoth then <persName>Belcolore</persName>: <q>On Saturday
 I have to go to <placeName>Florence</placeName> to deliver some wool that I have spun,
 and to get my spinning-wheel put in order: lend me but five
 pounds--I know you have them--and I will redeem my perse
 petticoat from the pawnshop, and also the girdle that I wear on
 saints' days, and that I had when I was married--you see that
 without them I cannot go to church or anywhere else, and then I
 will do just as you wish thenceforth and forever.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08020029"/>Whereupon:
 <q>So God give me a good year,</q> quoth he, <q>as I have not the
 money with me: but never fear that I will see that thou hast it
 before Saturday with all the pleasure in life.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08020030"/><q>Ay, ay,</q> rejoined
 <persName>Belcolore</persName>, <q>you all make great promises, but then you never keep
 them. Think you to serve me as you served <persName>Biliuzza</persName>, whom you
 left in the lurch at last? God's faith, you do not so. To think
 that she turned woman of the world just for that! If you have
 not the money with you, why, go and get it.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08020031"/><q>Prithee,</q> returned
 the priest, <q>send me not home just now. For, seest thou, 'tis the
 very nick of time with me, and the coast is clear, and perchance it
 might not be so on my return, and in short I know not when it
 would be likely to go so well as now.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08020032"/>Whereto she did but
 rejoin: <q>Good; if you are minded to go, get you gone; if not,
 stay where you are.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08020033"/>The priest, therefore, seeing that she was
 not disposed to give him what he wanted, as he was fain, to wit, on
 his own terms, but was bent upon having a <!--(i)-->quid pro quo<!--(/i)-->, changed
 his tone; and: <q>Lo, now,</q> quoth he, <q>thou doubtest I will not
 bring thee the money; so to set thy mind at rest, I will leave thee
 this cloak--thou seest 'tis good sky-blue silk--in pledge.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08020034"/>So raising
 her head and glancing at the cloak: <q>And what may the cloak be
 worth?</q> quoth <persName>Belcolore</persName>. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08020035"/><q>Worth!</q> ejaculated the priest: <q>I
 would have thee know that 'tis all Douai, not to say Trouai,
 make: nay, there are some of our folk here that say 'tis Quadrouai; <pb n="184"/>and
 'tis not a fortnight since I bought it of <persName>Lotto</persName>, the secondhand
 dealer, for seven good pounds, and then had it five good soldi
 under value, by what I hear from <persName>Buglietto</persName>, who, thou knowest,
 is an excellent judge of these articles.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08020036"/><q>Oh! say you so?</q>
 exclaimed <persName>Belcolore</persName>. <q>So help me God, I should not have thought
 it; however, let me look at it.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08020037"/>So Master Priest, being ready for
 action, doffed the cloak and handed it to her. And she, having
 put it in a safe place, said to him: <q>Now, Sir, we will away to
 the hut; there is never a soul goes there;</q> and so they did. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08020038"/>And
 there Master Priest, giving her many a mighty buss and straining
 her to his sacred person, solaced himself with her no little while.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08020039"/>Which done, he hied him away in his cassock, as if he were come
 from officiating at a wedding; but, when he was back in his holy
 quarters, he bethought him that not all the candles that he received
 by way of offering in the course of an entire year would amount to
 the half of five pounds, and saw that he had made a bad bargain,
 and repented him that he had left the cloak in pledge, and cast
 about how he might recover it without paying anything. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08020040"/>And as
 he did not lack cunning, he hit upon an excellent expedient, by
 which he compassed his end. So on the morrow, being a saint's
 day, he sent a neighbour's lad to Monna <persName>Belcolore</persName> with a request
 that she would be so good as to lend him her stone mortar, for that
 Binguccio dal Poggio and Nuto Buglietti were to breakfast with
 him that morning, and he therefore wished to make a sauce.
 <persName>Belcolore</persName> having sent the mortar, 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08020041"/>the priest, about breakfast time,
 reckoning that Bentivegna del Mazzo and <persName>Belcolore</persName> would be at
 their meal, called his clerk, and said to him: <q>Take the mortar
 back to <persName>Belcolore</persName>, and say: 'My master thanks you very kindly,
 and bids you return the cloak that the lad left with you in pledge.'</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08020042"/>The clerk took the mortar to <persName>Belcolore</persName>'s house, where, finding her
 at table with Bentivegna, he set the mortar down and delivered the
 priest's message. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08020043"/>Whereto <persName>Belcolore</persName> would fain have demurred;
 but Bentivegna gave her a threatening glance, saying: <q>So, then,
 thou takest a pledge from Master Priest? By Christ, I vow, I
 have half a mind to give thee a great clout o' the chin. Go, give
 it back at once, a murrain on thee! And look to it that whatever
 he may have a mind to, were it our very ass, he be never denied.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08020044"/>So, with a very bad grace, <persName>Belcolore</persName> got up, and went to the <pb n="185"/>wardrobe,
 and took out the cloak, and gave it to the clerk, saying:
 <q>Tell thy master from me: Would to God he may never ply pestle
 in my mortar again, such honour has he done me for this turn!</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08020045"/>So the clerk returned with the cloak, and delivered the message to
 Master Priest; who, laughing, made answer: <q>Tell her, when
 thou next seest her, that, so she lend us not the mortar, I will not
 lend her the pestle: be it tit for tat.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08020046"/>Bentivegna made no account of his wife's words, deeming that
 'twas but his chiding that had provoked them. But <persName>Belcolore</persName> was
 not a little displeased with Master Priest, and had never a word to say
 to him till the vintage; after which, what with the salutary fear in
 which she stood of the mouth of Lucifer the Great, to which he
 threatened to consign her, and the must and roast chestnuts that he
 sent her, she made it up with him, and many a jolly time they had
 together. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08020047"/>And though she got not the five pounds from him, he put
 a new skin on her tabret, and fitted it with a little bell, wherewith
 she was satisfied.</p></div><pb n="186"/><!--***********************************Novella 3*********************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0803"><head>Novel III</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030001"/><!--(i)--><persName>Calandrino</persName>, Bruno and Buffalmacco go in quest of the

      and queer folk, there dwelt, no long time ago, a painter named
      <persName>Calandrino</persName>, a simple soul, of uncouth manners, that spent most of
      his time with two other painters, the one Bruno, the other
      Buffalmacco, by name, pleasant fellows enough, but not without
      their full share of sound and shrewd sense, and who kept with
      <persName>Calandrino</persName> for that they not seldom found his singular ways and
      his simplicity very diverting. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030005"/>There was also at the same time
      at <placeName>Florence</placeName> one Maso del Saggio, a fellow marvellously entertaining
      by his cleverness, dexterity and unfailing resource; who having
      heard somewhat touching <persName>Calandrino</persName>'s simplicity, resolved to make
      fun of him by playing him a trick, and inducing him to believe
      some prodigy. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030006"/>And happening one day to come upon <persName>Calandrino</persName> in
      the church of <placeName>San Giovanni</placeName>, where he sate intently regarding the
      paintings and intaglios of the tabernacle above the altar, which had
      <pb n="187"/>then
      but lately been set there, he deemed time and place convenient
      for the execution of his design; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030007"/>which he accordingly imparted to
      one of his comrades: whereupon the two men drew nigh the place
      where <persName>Calandrino</persName> sate alone, and feigning not to see him fell a
      talking of the virtues of divers stones, of which Maso spoke as aptly
      and pertinently as if he had been a great and learned lapidary.
      <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030008"/><persName>Calandrino</persName> heard what passed between them, and witting that 'twas
      no secret, after a while got up, and joined them, to Maso's no small
      delight. He therefore continued his discourse, and being asked by
      <persName>Calandrino</persName>, where these stones of such rare virtues were to be found,
      made answer: 
      <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030009"/><q>Chiefly in <placeName>Berlinzone</placeName>, in the <placeName>land of the Basques</placeName>.
	The district is called <placeName>Bengodi</placeName>, and there they bind the vines with
	sausages, and a denier will buy a goose and a gosling into the
	bargain; and on a mountain, all of grated Parmesan cheese, dwell
	folk that do nought else but make macaroni and raviuoli,<note>A sort of
	  rissole.</note> and boil
	them in capon's broth, and then throw them down to be scrambled
	for; and hard by flows a rivulet of Vernaccia, the best that ever
	was drunk, and never a drop of water therein.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030010"/><q>Ah! 'tis a sweet
	country!</q> quoth <persName>Calandrino</persName>; <q>but tell me, what becomes of the
	capons that they boil?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030011"/><q>They are all eaten by the Basques,</q>
      replied Maso. 
      <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030012"/>Then: <q>Wast thou ever there?</q> quoth <persName>Calandrino</persName>.
      <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030013"/>Whereupon: <q>Was I ever there, sayst thou?</q> replied Maso.
      <q>Why, if I have been there once, I have been there a thousand
	times.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030014"/><q>And how many miles is't from here?</q> quoth <persName>Calandrino</persName>.
      <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030015"/><q>Oh!</q> returned Maso, <q>more than thou couldst number in a night
	without slumber.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030016"/><q>Farther off, then, than the <placeName>Abruzzi</placeName>?</q> said
      <persName>Calandrino</persName>. 
      <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030017"/><q>Why, yes, 'tis a bit farther,</q> replied Maso.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030018"/>Now <persName>Calandrino</persName>, like the simple soul that he was, marking the
 composed and grave countenance with which Maso spoke, could not
 have believed him more thoroughly, if he had uttered the most patent
 truth, and thus taking his words for gospel: <q>'Tis a trifle too far
 for my purse,</q> quoth he; <q>were it nigher, I warrant thee, I
 would go with thee thither one while, just to see the macaroni
 come tumbling down, and take my fill thereof. But tell me, so good
 luck befall thee, are none of these stones, that have these rare virtues,
 to be found in these regions?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030019"/><q>Ay,</q> replied Maso, <q>two sorts of
 <pb n="188"/>stone
 are found there, both of virtues extraordinary. The one sort
 are the sandstones of <placeName>Settignano</placeName> and <placeName>Montisci</placeName>, which being made
 into millstones, by virtue thereof flour is made; wherefore 'tis a
 common saying in those countries that blessings come from God and
 millstones from <placeName>Montisci</placeName>: but, for that these sandstones are in great
 plenty, they are held cheap by us, just as by them are emeralds,
 whereof they have mountains, bigger than <placeName>Monte Morello</placeName>, that shine
 at midnight, a God's name! And know this, that whoso should make
 a goodly pair of millstones, and connect them with a ring before ever
 a hole was drilled in them, and take them to the Soldan, should get
 all he would have thereby. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030020"/>The other sort of stone is the heliotrope,
 as we lapidaries call it, a stone of very great virtue, inasmuch as
 whoso carries it on his person is seen, so long as he keep it, by never
 another soul, where he is not.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030021"/><q>These be virtues great indeed,</q>
 quoth <persName>Calandrino</persName>; <q>but where is this second stone to be found?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030022"/>Whereto Maso made answer that there were usually some to be
 found in the <placeName>Mugnone</placeName>. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030023"/><q>And what are its size and colour?</q> quoth
      <persName>Calandrino</persName>. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030024"/><q>The size varies,</q> replied Maso, <q>for some are bigger
 and some smaller than others; but all are of the same colour, being
 nearly black.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030025"/>All these matters duly marked and fixed in his memory,
 <persName>Calandrino</persName> made as if he had other things to attend to, and took his
 leave of Maso with the intention of going in quest of the stone, but
 not until he had let his especial friends, Bruno and Buffalmacco,
 know of his project. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030026"/>So, that no time might be lost, but, postponing
 everything else, they might begin the quest at once, he set about
 looking for them, and spent the whole morning in the search. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030027"/>At
 length, when 'twas already past none, he called to mind that they
 would be at work in the Faentine women's convent, and though
 'twas excessively hot, he let nothing stand in his way, but at a pace
      that was more like a run than a walk, hied him thither; and so soon
      as he had made them ware of his presence, thus he spoke: 
      <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030028"/><q>Comrades,
	so you are but minded to hearken to me, 'tis in our power to
	become the richest men in <placeName>Florence</placeName>; for I am informed by one that
	may be trusted that there is a kind of stone in the <placeName>Mugnone</placeName> which
	renders whoso carries it invisible to every other soul in the world.
	Wherefore, methinks, we were wise to let none have the start of us,
	but go search for this stone without any delay. 
	<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030029"/>We shall find it
	without a doubt, for I know what 'tis like, and when we have found <pb n="189"/>it,
 we have but to put it in the purse, and get us to the moneychangers,
	whose counters, as you know, are always laden with groats
 and florins, and help ourselves to as many as we have a mind to.
	No one will see us, and so, hey presto! we shall be rich folk in the
	twinkling of an eye, and have no more need to go besmearing the
	walls all day long like so many snails.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030030"/>Whereat Bruno and Buffalmacco
      began only to laugh, and exchanging glances, made as if they
      marvelled exceedingly, and expressed approval of <persName>Calandrino</persName>'s project.
      Then Buffalmacco asked, what might be the name of the stone.
      <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030031"/><persName>Calandrino</persName>, like the numskull that he was, had already forgotten the
      name: so he made answer: <q>Why need we concern ourselves
	with the name, since we know the stone's virtue? methinks, we
	were best to go look for it, and waste no more time.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030032"/><q>Well, well,</q>
      said Bruno, <q>but what are the size and shape of the stone?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030033"/><q>They
	are of all sizes and shapes,</q> said <persName>Calandrino</persName>, <q>but they are all pretty
	nearly black; wherefore, methinks, we were best to collect all the
	black stones that we see until we hit upon it: and so, let us be off,
	and lose no more time.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030034"/><q>Nay, but,</q> said Bruno, <q>wait a bit.</q>
      And turning to Buffalmacco: <q>Methinks,</q> quoth he, <q>that <persName>Calandrino</persName>
	says well: but I doubt this is not the time for such work,
	seeing that the sun is high, and his rays so flood the <placeName>Mugnone</placeName> as to
	dry all the stones; insomuch that stones will now shew as white
	that in the morning, before the sun had dried them, would shew as
	black: 
	<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030035"/>besides which, to-day being a working-day, there will be for
	one cause or another folk not a few about the <placeName>Mugnone</placeName>, who, seeing
	us, might guess what we were come for, and peradventure do the like
	themselves; whereby it might well be that they found the stone, and
	we might miss the trot by trying after the amble. 
	<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030036"/>Wherefore, so
	you agree, methinks we were best to go about it in the morning,
	when we shall be better able to distinguish the black stones from the
	white, and on a holiday, when there will be none to see us.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030037"/>Buffalmacco's advice being approved by Bruno, <persName>Calandrino</persName>
      chimed in; and so 'twas arranged that they should all three go in
      quest of the stone on the following Sunday. So <persName>Calandrino</persName>, having
      besought his companions above all things to let never a soul in the
      world hear aught of the matter, for that it had been imparted to him
      in strict confidence, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030038"/>and having told them what he had heard touching
      the land of <placeName>Bengodi</placeName>, the truth of which he affirmed with oaths, <pb n="190"/>took
      leave of them; and they concerted their plan, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030039"/>while <persName>Calandrino</persName>
      impatiently expected the Sunday morning. Whereon, about dawn,
      he arose, and called them; and forth they issued by the Porta a San
      Gallo, and hied them to the <placeName>Mugnone</placeName>, and following its course,
      began their quest of the stone, <persName>Calandrino</persName>, as was natural, leading
      the way, and jumping lightly from rock to rock, and wherever he
      espied a black stone, stooping down, picking it up and putting it in
      the fold of his tunic, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030040"/>while his comrades followed, picking up a stone
      here and a stone there. Thus it was that <persName>Calandrino</persName> had not gone
      far, before, finding that there was no more room in his tunic, he lifted
      the skirts of his gown, which was not cut after the fashion of
      Hainault, and gathering them under his leathern girdle and making
      them fast on every side, thus furnished himself with a fresh and
      capacious lap, which, however, taking no long time to fill, he made
      another lap out of his cloak, which in like manner he soon filled
      with stones. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030041"/>Wherefore, Bruno and Buffalmacco seeing that
      <persName>Calandrino</persName> was well laden, and that 'twas nigh upon breakfast-time,
      and the moment for action come: <q>Where is <persName>Calandrino</persName>?</q>
      quoth Bruno to Buffalmacco. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030042"/>Whereto Buffalmacco, who had
      <persName>Calandrino</persName> full in view, having first turned about and looked here,
      there and everywhere, made answer: <q>That wot not I; but not
	so long ago he was just in front of us.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030043"/><q>Not so long ago,
	forsooth,</q>
      returned Bruno; <q>'tis my firm belief that at this very moment he is
 at breakfast at home, having left to us this wild-goose chase of black
	stones in the <placeName>Mugnone</placeName>.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030044"/><q>Marry,</q> quoth Buffalmacco, <q>he did but
	serve us right so to trick us and leave, seeing that we were so silly as
	to believe him. Why, who could have thought that any but we
	would have been so foolish as to believe that a stone of such rare
	virtue was to be found in the <placeName>Mugnone</placeName>?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030045"/><persName>Calandrino</persName>, hearing their
      colloquy, forthwith imagined that he had the stone in his hand, and
      by its virtue, though present, was invisible to them; and overjoyed by
      such good fortune, would not say a word to undeceive them, but
      determined to hie him home, and accordingly faced about, and put
      himself in motion. 
      <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030046"/>Whereupon: <q>Ay!</q> quoth Buffalmacco
      to Bruno, <q>what are we about that we go not back too?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030047"/><q>Go we
	then,</q> said Bruno; <q>but by God I swear that <persName>Calandrino</persName> shall
	never play me another such trick; and as to this, were I nigh him,
	as I have been all the morning, I would teach him to remember it <pb n="191"/>for
	a month or so, such a reminder would I give him in the heel
	with this stone.</q> And even as he spoke he threw back his arm, and
      launched the stone against <persName>Calandrino</persName>'s heel. Galled by the blow,
      <persName>Calandrino</persName> gave a great hop and a slight gasp, but said nothing, and
      halted not. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030048"/>Then, picking out one of the stones that he had
      collected: <q>Bruno,</q> quoth Buffalmacco, <q>see what a goodly
	stone I have here, would it might but catch <persName>Calandrino</persName> in the
	back;</q> and forthwith he discharged it with main force upon the
      said back. And in short, suiting action to word, now in this way,
      now in that, they stoned him all the way up the <placeName>Mugnone</placeName> as far as
      the <placeName>Porta a San Gallo</placeName>. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030049"/>There they threw away the stones they had
      picked up, and tarried a while with the customs' officers, who, being
      primed by them, had let <persName>Calandrino</persName> pass unchallenged, while their
      laughter knew no bounds.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030050"/>So <persName>Calandrino</persName>, halting nowhere, betook him to his house, which
      was hard by the corner of the Macina. And so well did Fortune
      prosper the trick, that all the way by the stream and across the city
      there was never a soul that said a word to <persName>Calandrino</persName>, and indeed he
      encountered but few, for most folk were at breakfast. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030051"/>But no
      sooner was <persName>Calandrino</persName> thus gotten home with his stones, than it so
      happened that his good lady, Monna Tessa, shewed her fair face at
      the stair's head, and catching sight of him, and being somewhat
      annoyed by his long delay, chid him, saying: <q>What the Devil
	brings thee here so late? Must breakfast wait thee until all other
	folk have had it?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030052"/><persName>Calandrino</persName> caught the words, and angered and
      mortified to find that he was not invisible, broke out with: <q>Alas!
	curst woman! so 'twas thou! Thou hast undone me: but, God's
	faith, I will pay thee out.</q> Whereupon he was upstairs in a trice,
      and having discharged his great load of stones in a parlour, rushed
      with fell intent upon his wife, and laid hold of her by the hair, and
      threw her down at his feet, and beat and kicked her in every part of
      her person with all the force he had in his arms and legs, insomuch
      that he left never a hair of her head or bone of her body unscathed,
      and 'twas all in vain that she laid her palms together and crossed her
      fingers and cried for mercy.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030053"/>Now Buffalmacco and Bruno, after making merry a while with
      the warders of the gate, had set off again at a leisurely pace, keeping
      some distance behind <persName>Calandrino</persName>. Arrived at his door, they heard <pb n="192"/>the
      noise of the sound thrashing that he was giving his wife; and
      making as if they were but that very instant come upon the scene,
      they called him. <persName>Calandrino</persName>, flushed, all of a sweat, and out of
      breath, shewed himself at the window, and bade them come up.
      <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030054"/>They, putting on a somewhat angry air, did so; and espied <persName>Calandrino</persName>
 sitting in the parlour, amid the stones which lay all about,
 untrussed, and puffing with the air of a man spent with exertion,
 while his lady lay in one of the corners, weeping bitterly, her hair all
 dishevelled, her clothes torn to shreds, and her face livid, bruised and
 battered. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030055"/>So after surveying the room a while: <q>What means
 this, <persName>Calandrino</persName>?</q> quoth they. <q>Art thou minded to build thee a
 wall, that we see so many stones about?</q> And then, as they received
 no answer, they continued: <q>And how's this? How comes
 Monna Tessa in this plight? 'Twould seem thou hast given her a
 beating! What unheard-of doings are these?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030056"/>What with the
 weight of the stones that he had carried, and the fury with which he
 had beaten his wife, and the mortification that he felt at the miscarriage
 of his enterprise, <persName>Calandrino</persName> was too spent to utter a word
 by way of reply. Wherefore in a menacing tone Buffalmacco began
 again: 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030057"/><q>However out of sorts thou mayst have been, <persName>Calandrino</persName>,
 thou shouldst not have played us so scurvy a trick as thou hast. To
 take us with thee to the <placeName>Mugnone</placeName> in quest of this stone of rare
 virtue, and then, without so much as saying either God-speed or
 Devil-speed, to be off, and leave us there like a couple of gowks!
 We take it not a little unkindly: and rest assured that thou shalt
 never so fool us again.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030058"/>Whereto with an effort <persName>Calandrino</persName> replied:
 <q>Comrades, be not wroth with me: 'tis not as you think.
 I, luckless wight! found the stone: listen, and you will no longer
 doubt that I say sooth. When you began saying one to the other:
 'Where is <persName>Calandrino</persName>?' I was within ten paces of you, and marking
 that you came by without seeing me, I went before, and so, keeping
 ever a little ahead of you, I came hither.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030059"/>And then he told them the
 whole story of what they had said and done from beginning to end,
 and shewed them his back and heel, how they had been mauled by
 the stones; after which: 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030060"/><q>And I tell you,</q> he went on, <q>that,
 laden though I was with all these stones, that you see here, never a
 word was said to me by the warders of the gate as I passed in, though
 you know how vexatious and grievous these warders are wont to <pb n="193"/>make
 themselves in their determination to see everything: and moreover
 I met by the way several of my gossips and friends that are ever
 wont to greet me, and ask me to drink, and never a word said any or
 them to me, no, nor half a word either; but they passed me by as
 men that saw me not. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030061"/>But at last, being come home, I was met
 and seen by this devil of a woman, curses upon her, forasmuch as all
 things, as you know, lose their virtue in the presence of a woman;
 whereby I from being the most lucky am become the most luckless
 man in <placeName>Florence</placeName>: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030062"/>and therefore I thrashed her as long as I could stir
 a hand, nor know I wherefore I forbear to sluice her veins for her,
 cursed be the hour that first I saw her, cursed be the hour that I
 brought her into the house!</q> And so, kindling with fresh wrath, he
 was about to start up and give her another thrashing; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030063"/>when Buffalmacco
 and Bruno, who had listened to his story with an air of great
 surprise, and affirmed its truth again and again, while they all but burst
 with suppressed laughter, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030064"/>seeing him now frantic to renew his assault
 upon his wife, got up and withstood and held him back, averring that
 the lady was in no wise to blame for what had happened, but only he,
 who, witting that things lost their virtue in the presence of women, had
 not bidden her keep aloof from him that day; which precaution God
 had not suffered him to take, either because the luck was not to be
 his, or because he was minded to cheat his comrades, to whom he
 should have shewn the stone as soon as he found it. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08030065"/>And so, with
 many words they hardly prevailed upon him to forgive his injured
 wife, and leaving him to rue the ill-luck that had filled his house
 with stones, went their way.</p></div><pb n="194"/><!--***********************************Novella 4*********************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0804"><head>Novel IV</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08040001"/><!--(i)-->The rector of <placeName>Fiesole</placeName> loves a widow lady, by whom he is

	more than one of the stories that have been told; but as 'twere not
	possible to say so much thereof but that more would yet remain to
	say, I purpose to supplement them with the story of a rector, who, in
	defiance of all the world, was bent upon having the favour of a
	gentlewoman, whether she would or no. Which gentlewoman,
	being discreet above a little, treated him as he deserved.</p></body></floatingText><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08040004"/><placeName>Fiesole</placeName>, whose hill is here within sight, is, as each of you knows,
 a city of immense antiquity, and was aforetime great, though now
 'tis fallen into complete decay; which notwithstanding, it always was,
 and still is the see of a bishop. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08040005"/>Now there was once a gentlewoman,
 Monna Piccarda by name, a widow, that had an estate at <placeName>Fiesole</placeName>,
 hard by the cathedral, on which, for that she was not in the easiest
 circumstances, she lived most part of the year, and with her her two
 brothers, very worthy and courteous young men, both of them.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08040006"/>And the lady being wont frequently to resort to the cathedral, and
 being still quite young and fair and debonair withal, it so befell that
 the rector grew in the last degree enamoured of her, and waxed at
 length so bold, that he himself avowed his passion to the lady, praying
 <pb n="195"/>her
 to entertain his love, and requite it in like measure. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08040007"/>The rector
 was advanced in years, but otherwise the veriest springald, being bold
 and of a high spirit, of a boundless conceit of himself, and of mien
 and manners most affected and in the worst taste, and withal so tiresome
 and insufferable that he was on bad terms with everybody, and,
 if with one person more than another, with this lady, who not only
 cared not a jot for him, but had liefer have had a headache than his
 company. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08040008"/>Wherefore the lady discreetly made answer: <q>I may
 well prize your love, Sir, and love you I should and will right gladly;
 but such love as yours and mine may never admit of aught that is
 not honourable. You are my spiritual father and a priest, and now
 verging towards old age, circumstances which should ensure your
 honour and chastity; and I, on my part, am no longer a girl, such
 as these love affairs might beseem, but a widow, and well you wot
 how it behoves widows to be chaste. Wherefore I pray you to have
 me excused; for, after the sort you crave, you shall never have my
 love, nor would I in such sort be loved by you.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08040009"/>With this answer
 the rector was for the nonce fain to be content; but he was not the
 man to be dismayed and routed by a first repulse; and with his
 wonted temerity and effrontery he plied her again and again with
 letters and ambassages, and also by word of mouth, when he espied
 her entering the church. Wherefore the lady finding this persecution
 more grievous and harassing than she could well bear, cast about how
 she might be quit thereof in such fashion as he deserved, seeing that
 he left her no choice; howbeit she would do nought in the matter
 until she had conferred with her brothers. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08040010"/>She therefore told them
 how the rector pursued her, and how she meant to foil him; and,
 with their full concurrence, some few days afterwards she went, as
 she was wont, to church. The rector no sooner saw her, than he
 approached and accosted her, as he was wont, in a tone of easy
 familiarity. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08040011"/>The lady greeted him, as he came up, with a glance
 of gladsome recognition; and when he had treated her to not a little
 of his wonted eloquence, she drew him aside, and heaving a great
 sigh, said: 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08040012"/><q>I have oftentimes heard it said, Sir, that there is no
 castle so strong, but that, if the siege be continued day by day, it
 will sooner or later be taken; which I now plainly perceive is my
 own case. For so fairly have you hemmed me in with this, that, and
 the other pretty speech or the like blandishments, that you have
 con<pb n="196"/>strained
 me to make nought of my former resolve, and, seeing that I
 find such favour with you, to surrender myself unto you.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08040013"/>Whereto,
 overjoyed, the rector made answer: <q>Madam, I am greatly
 honoured; and, sooth to say, I marvelled not a little how you should
 hold out so long, seeing that I have never had the like experience
 with any other woman, insomuch that I have at times said: 'Were
 women of silver, they would not be worth a denier, for there is none
 but would give under the hammer.' But no more of this: when and
 where may we come together?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08040014"/><q>Sweet my lord,</q> replied the lady,
 <q>for the when, 'tis just as we may think best, for I have no husband
 to whom to render account of my nights, but the where passes my
 wit to conjecture.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08040015"/><q>How so?</q> quoth the rector. <q>Why not in
 your own house?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08040016"/><q>Sir,</q> replied the lady, <q>you know that I have
 two brothers, both young men, who day and night bring their comrades
 into the house, which is none too large: for which reason it
 might not be done there, unless we were minded to make ourselves,
 as it were, dumb and blind, uttering never a word, not so much as a
 monosyllable, and abiding in the dark: in such sort indeed it might
 be, because they do not intrude upon my chamber; but theirs is so
 near to mine that the very least whisper could not but be heard.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08040017"/><q>Nay but, Madam,</q> returned the rector, <q>let not this stand in our
 way for a night or two, until I may bethink me where else we might
 be more at our ease.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08040018"/><q>Be that as you will, Sir,</q> quoth the lady,
 <q>I do but entreat that the affair be kept close, so that never a word
 of it get wind.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08040019"/><q>Have no fear on that score, Madam,</q> replied the
 priest; <q>and if so it may be, let us forgather to-night.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08040020"/><q>With
 pleasure,</q> returned the lady; and having appointed him how and
 when to come, she left him and went home.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08040021"/>Now the lady had a maid, that was none too young, and had a
 countenance the ugliest and most misshapen that ever was seen; for
 indeed she was flat-nosed, wry-mouthed, and thick-lipped, with huge,
 ill-set teeth, eyes that squinted and were ever bleared, and a complexion
 betwixt green and yellow, that shewed as if she had spent the
 summer not at <placeName>Fiesole</placeName> but at Sinigaglia: besides which she was hipshot
 and somewhat halting on the right side. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08040022"/>Her name was Ciuta,
 but, for that she was such a scurvy bitch to look upon, she was called
 by all folk <persName>Ciutazza</persName>.<note>An augmentative form, with a suggestion of
 <!--(i)-->cagnazza,<!--(/i)--> bitch-like.</note> And being thus misshapen of body, she
 was
 <pb n="197"/>also not without her share of guile. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08040023"/>So the lady called her and said:
 <q><persName>Ciutazza</persName>, so thou wilt do me a service to-night, I will give thee
 a fine new shift.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08040024"/>At the mention of the shift <persName>Ciutazza</persName> made
 answer: <q>So you give me a shift, Madam, I will throw myself
 into the very fire.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08040025"/><q>Good,</q> said the lady; <q>then I would have
 thee lie to-night in my bed with a man, whom thou wilt caress; but
 look thou say never a word, that my brothers, who, as thou knowest,
 sleep in the next room, hear thee not; and afterwards I will give
 thee the shift.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08040026"/><q>Sleep with a man!</q> quoth <persName>Ciutazza</persName>: <q>why, if
 need be, I will sleep with six.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08040027"/>So in the evening Master Rector
 came, as he had been bidden; and the two young men, as the lady
 had arranged, being in their room, and making themselves very audible,
 he stole noiselessly, and in the dark, into the lady's room, and got
 him on to the bed, which <persName>Ciutazza</persName>, well advised by the lady how to
 behave, mounted from the other side. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08040028"/>Whereupon Master Rector,
 thinking to have the lady by his side, took <persName>Ciutazza</persName> in his arms, and
 fell a kissing her, saying never a word the while, and <persName>Ciutazza</persName> did
 the like; and so he enjoyed her, plucking the boon which he had so
 long desired.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08040029"/>The rector and <persName>Ciutazza</persName> thus closeted, the lady charged her
      brothers to execute the rest of her plan. They accordingly stole
      quietly out of their room, and hied them to the piazza, where
      Fortune proved propitious beyond what they had craved of her; for,
      it being a very hot night, the bishop had been seeking them, purposing
      to go home with them, and solace himself with their society, and
      quench his thirst. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08040030"/>With which desire he acquainted them, as soon
      as he espied them coming into the piazza; and so they escorted him
      to their house, and there in the cool of their little courtyard, which
      was bright with many a lamp, he took, to his no small comfort, a
      draught of their good wine. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08040031"/>Which done: <q>Sir,</q> said the young
      men, <q>since of your great courtesy you have deigned to visit our poor
	house, to which we were but now about to invite you, we should be
	gratified if you would be pleased to give a look at somewhat, a mere
	trifle though it be, which we have here to shew you.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08040032"/>The bishop
      replied that he would do so with pleasure. Whereupon one of the
      young men took a lighted torch and led the way, the bishop and
      the rest following, to the chamber where Master Rector lay with
      <persName>Ciutazza</persName>.</p><pb n="198"/><p>Now the rector, being in hot haste, had ridden hard, insomuch
 that he was already gotten above three miles on his way when they
 arrived; and so, being somewhat tired, he was resting, but, hot
 though the night was, he still held <persName>Ciutazza</persName> in his arms. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08040033"/>In which
 posture he was shewn to the bishop, when, preceded by the young
 man bearing the light, and followed by the others, he entered the
 chamber. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08040034"/>And being roused, and observing the light and the folk
 that stood about him, Master Rector was mighty ashamed and
 affrighted, and popped his head under the clothes. But the bishop,
 reprimanding him severely, constrained him to thrust his head out
 again, and take a view of his bed-fellow. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08040035"/>Thus made aware of the
 trick which the lady had played him, the rector was now, both on
 that score and by reason of his signal disgrace, the saddest man that

 custody and sent to prison, there to expiate his offence by a rigorous

 both the lady and the young men not a little, for that they had taken

 forty days; but what with his love, and the scornful requital which
 it had received, he bewailed it more than forty and nine days, not to
 mention that for a great while he could not shew himself in the
 street but the boys would point the finger at him and say:
 <q>There goes he that lay with <persName>Ciutazza</persName>.</q> Which was such an
 affliction to him that he was like to go mad. On this wise the

	tell you, and to tell you another, touching him and some of his

	(albeit 'tis not unseemly) which your modesty forbears to use, is yet
	so laughable that I shall relate it.</p></body></floatingText><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08050004"/>As you all may well have heard, there come not seldom to our
 city magistrates from the Marches, who for the most part are men
 of a mean spirit, and in circumstances so reduced and beggarly, that
 their whole life seems to be but a petty-foggery; and by reason of
 this their inbred sordidness and avarice they bring with them judges
 and notaries that have rather the air of men taken from the plough
 or the last than trained in the schools of law.<note>It was owing to their
 internal dissensions that the Florentines were
 from time to time fain to introduce these stranger Podestàs.</note><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08050005"/>Now one of these
 Marchers, being come hither as Podestà, brought with him judges
 not a few, and among them one that called himself Messer Niccola
 da <placeName>San Lepidio</placeName>, and looked liker to a locksmith than aught else.
 However, this fellow was assigned with the rest of the judges to
 hear criminal causes. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08050006"/>And as folk will often go to the court, though
 they have no concern whatever there, it so befell that Maso del <pb n="200"/>Saggio
 went thither one morning in quest of one of his friends, and
 there chancing to set eyes on this Messer Niccola, where he sate,
 deemed him a fowl of no common feather, and surveyed him from
 head to foot, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08050007"/>observing that the vair which he wore on his head was
 all begrimed, that he carried an ink-horn at his girdle, that his gown
 was longer than his robe, and many another detail quite foreign to
 the appearance of a man of birth and breeding, of which that which
 he deemed most notable was a pair of breeches, which, as he saw
 (for the judge's outer garments being none too ample were open in
 front, as he sate), reached half-way down his legs. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08050008"/>By which sight his
 mind was presently diverted from the friend whom he came there to
 seek; and forth he hied him in quest of other two of his comrades,
 the one Ribi, the other <persName>Matteuzzo</persName> by name, fellows both of them
 not a whit less jolly than Maso himself; and having found them, he
 said to them: <q>An you love me, come with me to the court, and
 I will shew you the queerest scarecrow that ever you saw.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08050009"/>So the
 two men hied them with him to the court; and there he pointed
 out to them the judge and his breeches. What they saw from a
 distance served to set them laughing: then drawing nearer to the
 daïs on which Master Judge was seated, they observed that 'twas
 easy enough to get under the daïs, and moreover that the plank, on
 which the judge's feet rested, was broken, so that there was plenty
 of room for the passage of a hand and arm. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08050010"/>Whereupon quoth
 Maso to his comrades: <q>'Twere a very easy matter to pull these
 breeches right down: wherefore I propose that we do so.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08050011"/>Each
 of the men had marked how it might be done; and so, having
 concerted both what they should do and what they should say, they
 came to the court again next morning; and, the court being
 crowded, <persName>Matteuzzo</persName>, observed by never a soul, slipped beneath the
 daïs, and posted himself right under the spot where the judge's feet
 rested, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08050012"/>while the other two men took their stand on either side of the
 judge, each laying hold of the hem of his robe. Then: <q>Sir, sir, I
 pray you for God's sake,</q> began Maso, <q>that, before the pilfering
 rascal
 that is there beside you can make off, you constrain him to give me
 back a pair of jack boots that he has stolen from me, which theft
 he still denies, though 'tis not a month since I saw him getting
 them resoled.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08050013"/>Meanwhile Ribi, at the top of his voice, shouted:
 <q>Believe him not, Sir, the scurvy knave! 'Tis but that he knows <pb n="201"/>that
 I am come to demand restitution of a valise that he has stolen
 from me that he now for the first time trumps up this story about
 a pair of jack boots that I have had in my house down to the last
 day or two; and if you doubt what I say, I can bring as witness
 Trecca, my neighbour, and Grassa, the tripe-woman, and one that
 goes about gathering the sweepings of <placeName>Santa Maria a Verzaia</placeName>, who
 saw him when he was on his way back from the farm.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08050014"/>But shout
 as he might, Maso was still even with him, nor for all that did Ribi
 bate a jot of his clamour. And while the judge stood, bending now
 towards the one, now towards the other, the better to hear them,
 <persName>Matteuzzo</persName> seized his opportunity, and thrusting his hand through
 the hole in the plank caught hold of the judge's breeches, and tugged
 at them amain. Whereby down they came straightway, for the
 judge was a lean man, and shrunk in the buttocks. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08050015"/>The judge,
 being aware of the accident, but knowing not how it had come
 about, would have gathered his outer garments together in front, so
 as to cover the defect, but Maso on the one side, and Ribi on the
 other, held him fast, shouting amain and in chorus: 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08050016"/><q>You do me a
 grievous wrong, Sir, thus to deny me justice, nay, even a hearing,
 and to think of quitting the court: there needs no writ in this city
 for such a trifling matter as this.</q> And thus they held him by the
 clothes and in parley, until all that were in the court perceived that
 he had lost his breeches. However, after a while, <persName>Matteuzzo</persName>
 dropped the breeches, and slipped off, and out of the court, without
 being observed, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08050017"/>and Ribi, deeming that the joke had gone far
 enough, exclaimed: <q>By God, I vow, I will appeal to the Syndics;</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08050018"/>while Maso, on the other side, let go the robe, saying: <q>Nay,
 but for my part, I will come here again and again and again, until I
 find you less embarrassed than you seem to be to-day.</q> And so the
 one this way, the other that way, they made off with all speed.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08050019"/>Whereupon Master Judge, disbreeched before all the world, was as
 one that awakens from sleep, albeit he was ware of his forlorn
 condition, and asked whither the parties in the case touching the
 jack boots and the valise were gone. However, as they were not
 to be found, he fell a swearing by the bowels of God, that 'twas
 meet and proper that he should know and wit, whether 'twas the
 custom at <placeName>Florence</placeName> to disbreech judges sitting in the seat of justice.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08050020"/>When the affair reached the ears of the Podestà, he made no
 <pb n="202"/>little stir about it; but, being informed by some of his friends, that
 'twould not have happened, but that the Florentines were minded
 to shew him, that, in place of the judges he should have brought
 with him, he had brought but gowks, to save expense, he deemed it
 best to say no more about it, and so for that while the matter went
 no further.</p></div><pb n="203"/><!--***********************************Novella 6************************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0806"><head>Novel VI</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08060001"/><!--(i)-->Bruno and Buffalmacco steal a pig from <persName>Calandrino</persName>, and

      <placeName>Florence</placeName>, which his wife had brought him by way of dowry, and
      which yielded them yearly, among other matters, a pig; and 'twas

      Bruno and Buffalmacco learning that he was gone to the farm, and
      that his wife was not with him, betook them to the house of a
      priest that was their especial friend and a neighbour of <persName>Calandrino</persName>,
      <pb n="204"/>there to tarry a while. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08060006"/>Upon their arrival <persName>Calandrino</persName>, who had
      that very morning killed the pig, met them with the priest, and
      accosted them, saying: <q>A hearty welcome to you. I should
	like you to see what an excellent manager I am;</q> and so he took
      them into his house, and shewed them the pig. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08060007"/>They observed
      that 'twas a very fine pig; and learned from <persName>Calandrino</persName> that he was
      minded to salt it for household consumption. <q>Then thou art but

      replied <persName>Calandrino</persName>: <q>she would never believe me, and would drive

      The others said a great deal more, but to no purpose; and <persName>Calandrino</persName>
      bade them to supper, but so coldly that they declined, and left him.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08060009"/>Presently: <q>Should we not steal this pig from him to-night?</q>
      quoth Bruno to Buffalmacco. 
      <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08060010"/><q>Could we so?</q> returned Buffalmacco.
      <q>How?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08060011"/><q>Why as to that,</q> rejoined Bruno, <q>I have
	already marked how it may be done, if he bestow not the pig

      quoth the priest. Whereupon: <q>Some address, though,</q> quoth
      Bruno, <q>will be needful: thou knowest, Buffalmacco, what a
	niggardly fellow <persName>Calandrino</persName> is, and how greedily he drinks at other
	folk's expense. Go we, therefore, and take him to the tavern,
	and there let the priest make as if, to do us honour, he would pay
	the whole score, and suffer <persName>Calandrino</persName> to pay never a soldo, and he
	will grow tipsy, and then we shall speed excellent well, because he
	is alone in the house.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08060014"/>As Bruno proposed, so they did: and <persName>Calandrino</persName>, finding that
      the priest would not suffer him to pay, drank amain, and took a great
      deal more aboard than he had need of; and the night being far spent
      when he left the tavern, he dispensed with supper, and went home,
      and thinking to have shut the door, got him to bed, leaving it open.
      <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08060015"/>Buffalmacco and Bruno went to sup with the priest; and after supper,
      taking with them certain implements with which to enter <persName>Calandrino</persName>'s
      house, where Bruno thought it most feasible, they stealthily approached
      it; but finding the door open, they entered, and took down the pig,
      and carried it away to the priest's house, and having there bestowed
      <pb n="205"/>it safely, went to bed. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08060016"/>In the morning when <persName>Calandrino</persName>, his head at

      and found that his pig was nowhere to be seen, and that the door
      was open, he asked this, that, and the other man, whether they wist
      who had taken the pig away, and getting no answer, he began to
      make a great outcry: <q>Alas, alas! luckless man that I am, that

      <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08060027"/><q>Ay indeed,</q> replied <persName>Calandrino</persName>; <q>'tis even so: and

      <q>we must find a way, if we can, to recover it.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08060031"/><q>Find a way?</q>
      said <persName>Calandrino</persName>: <q>how can we compass that?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08060032"/><q>Why,</q> replied
      Buffalmacco, <q>'tis certain that no one has come from <placeName>India</placeName> to steal

      Buffalmacco. 
      <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08060035"/>Whereto Bruno made answer: <q>It must be done
	with good pills of ginger and good vernaccia; and they must be

	come; and pills of ginger can be blessed just as well as bread and
	cheese.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08060036"/><q>Beyond a doubt, thou art right,</q> quoth Buffalmacco;
      <q>and thou, <persName>Calandrino</persName>, what sayst thou? Shall we do as Bruno
	says?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08060037"/><q>Nay, I entreat you, for the love of God,</q> quoth <persName>Calandrino</persName>,
      <q>do even so: for if I knew but who had had the pig, I should
	feel myself half consoled for my loss.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08060038"/><q>Go to, now,</q> quoth Bruno,
      <q>I am willing to do thy errand to <placeName>Florence</placeName> for these commodities, if
	thou givest me the money.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08060039"/><persName>Calandrino</persName> had some forty soldi upon him, which he gave to
      Bruno, who thereupon hied him to <placeName>Florence</placeName> to a friend of his that
      was an apothecary, and bought a pound of good pills of ginger, two
      of which, being of dog-ginger, he caused to be compounded with
      fresh hepatic aloes, and then to be coated with sugar like the others;
      and lest they should be lost, or any of the others mistaken for them,
      he had a slight mark set upon them by which he might readily
      recognize them. He also bought a flask of good vernaccia, and, thus
      laden, returned to the farm, and said to <persName>Calandrino</persName>: 
      <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08060040"/><q>To-morrow
	morning thou wilt bid those whom thou suspectest come hither to
	drink with thee: as 'twill be a saint's day, they will all come readily
	enough; and to-night I and Buffalmacco will say the incantation
	over the pills, which in the morning I will bring to thee here, and
	for our friendship's sake will administer them myself, and do and say
	all that needs to be said and done.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08060041"/>So <persName>Calandrino</persName> did as Bruno
      advised; and on the morrow a goodly company, as well of young
      men from <placeName>Florence</placeName>, that happened to be in the village, as of husbandmen,
      being assembled in front of the church around the elm, Bruno
      and Buffalmacco came, bearing a box containing the ginger, and the
      flask of wine, and ranged the folk in a circle. Whereupon:
      <pb n="207"/><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08060042"/><q>Gentlemen,</q> said Bruno, <q>'tis meet I tell you the reason why
	you
	are gathered here, that if aught unpleasant to you should befall, you
	may have no ground for complaint against me. 
	<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08060043"/><persName>Calandrino</persName> here was
	the night before last robbed of a fine pig, and cannot discover who
	has had it; and, for that it must have been stolen by some one of us
	here, he would have each of you take and eat one of these pills and
	drink of this vernaccia. Wherefore I forthwith do you to wit, that
	whoso has had the pig will not be able to swallow the pill, but will
	find it more bitter than poison, and will spit it out; and so, rather
	than he should suffer this shame in presence of so many, 'twere
	perhaps best that he that has had the pig should confess the fact to
	the priest, and I will wash my hands of the affair.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08060044"/>All professed themselves ready enough to eat the pills; and so,
 having set them in a row with <persName>Calandrino</persName> among them, Bruno,
 beginning at one end, proceeded to give each a pill, and when he
 came to <persName>Calandrino</persName> he chose one of the pills of dog-ginger and put it
 in his hand. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08060045"/><persName>Calandrino</persName> thrust it forthwith between his teeth and
 began to chew it; but no sooner was his tongue acquainted with the
 aloes, than, finding the bitterness intolerable, he spat it out. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08060046"/>Now,
 the eyes of all the company being fixed on one another to see who should
 spit out his pill, Bruno, who, not having finished the distribution,
 feigned to be concerned with nought else, heard some one in his rear
 say: <q>Ha! <persName>Calandrino</persName>, what means this?</q> and at once turning
 round, and marking that <persName>Calandrino</persName> had spit out his pill: 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08060047"/><q>Wait a
 while,</q> quoth he, <q>perchance 'twas somewhat else that caused thee
 to spit: take another;</q> and thereupon whipping out the other pill of
 dog-ginger, he set it between <persName>Calandrino</persName>'s teeth, and finished the
 distribution. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08060048"/>Bitter as <persName>Calandrino</persName> had found the former pill, he
 found this tenfold more so; but being ashamed to spit it out, he kept
 it a while in his mouth and chewed it, and, as he did so, tears stood in
 his eyes that shewed as large as filberts, and at length, being unable
 to bear it any longer, he spat it out, as he had its predecessor. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08060049"/>Which
 being observed by Buffalmacco and Bruno, who were then administering
 the wine, and by all the company, 'twas averred by common
 consent that <persName>Calandrino</persName> had committed the theft himself; for which
 cause certain of them took him severely to task.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08060050"/>However, the company being dispersed, and Bruno and Buffalmacco
 left alone with <persName>Calandrino</persName>, Buffalmacco began on this wise:
 <pb n="208"/><q>I never doubted but that thou hadst had it thyself, and wast minded
 to make us believe that it had been stolen from thee, that we might
 not have of thee so much as a single drink out of the price which
 thou gottest for it.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08060051"/><persName>Calandrino</persName>, with the bitterness of the aloes
 still on his tongue, fell a swearing that he had not had it. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08060052"/>Whereupon:
 <q>Nay, but, comrade,</q> quoth Buffalmacco, <q>upon thy honour,
 what did it fetch? Six florins?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08060053"/>Whereto, <persName>Calandrino</persName> being now
 on the verge of desperation, Bruno added: <q>Now be reasonable,
 <persName>Calandrino</persName>; among the company that ate and drank with us there
 was one that told me that thou hadst up there a girl that thou didst
 keep for thy pleasure, giving her what by hook or by crook thou
 couldst get together, and that he held it for certain that thou hadst
 sent her this pig. And thou art grown expert in this sort of cozenage.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08060054"/>Thou tookest us one while adown the <placeName>Mugnone</placeName> a gathering black
 stones, and having thus started us on a wild-goose chase, thou madest
 off; and then wouldst fain have us believe that thou hadst found the
 stone: and now, in like manner, thou thinkest by thine oaths to
 persuade us that this pig which thou hast given away or sold, has
 been stolen from thee. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08060055"/>But we know thy tricks of old; never
 another couldst thou play us; and, to be round with thee, this spell
 has cost us some trouble: wherefore we mean that thou shalt give
 us two pair of capons, or we will let Monna Tessa know all.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08060056"/>Seeing
 that he was not believed, and deeming his mortification ample without
 the addition of his wife's resentment, <persName>Calandrino</persName> gave them the
 two pair of capons, with which, when the pig was salted, they
 returned to <placeName>Florence</placeName>, leaving <persName>Calandrino</persName> with the loss and the laugh
 against him.</p></div><pb n="209"/><!--****************************Novella 7**************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0807"><head>Novel VII</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070001"/><!--(i)-->A scholar loves a widow lady, who, being enamoured of

      'tis only little wits that delight to scorn. In a series of stories we have heard
      tell of tricks played without aught in the way of reprisals

      for a gentlewoman of our city (albeit the retribution that

      sort, and to such effect that she well-nigh died thereof. The which
      to hear will not be unprofitable to you, for thereby you will learn to
      be more careful how you flout others, and therein you will do very
      wisely.</p></body></floatingText><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070004"/>'Tis not many years since there dwelt at <placeName>Florence</placeName> a lady young
 and fair, and of a high spirit, as also of right gentle lineage, and
 tolerably well endowed with temporal goods. Now <persName>Elena</persName>--such
 was the lady's name--being left a widow, was minded never to marry
 again, being enamoured of a handsome young gallant of her own
 choosing, with whom she, recking nought of any other lover, did, by
 <pb n="210"/>the help of a maid in whom she placed much trust, not seldom speed
 the time gaily and with marvellous delight. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070005"/>Meanwhile it so befell
 that a young nobleman of our city, Rinieri by name, who had spent
 much time in study at <placeName>Paris</placeName>, not that he might thereafter sell his
 knowledge by retail, but that he might learn the reasons and causes
 of things, which accomplishment shews to most excellent advantage
 in a gentleman, returned to <placeName>Florence</placeName>, and there lived as a citizen in
 no small honour with his fellows, both by reason of his rank and of
 his learning. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070006"/>But as it is often the case that those who are most
 versed in deep matters are the soonest mastered by Love, so was it
 with Rinieri. For at a festal gathering, to which one day he went,
 there appeared before his eyes this <persName>Elena</persName>, of whom we spoke, clad in
 black, as is the wont of our Florentine widows, and shewing to his
 mind so much fairer and more debonair than any other woman that
 he had ever seen, that happy indeed he deemed the man might call
 himself, to whom God in His goodness should grant the right to hold
 her naked in his arms. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070007"/>So now and again he eyed her stealthily, and
 knowing that boons goodly and precious are not to be gotten without
 trouble, he made up his mind to study and labour with all assiduity
 how best to please her, that so he might win her love, and thereby
 the enjoyment of her.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070008"/>The young gentlewoman was not used to keep her eyes bent
 ever towards the infernal regions; but, rating herself at no less, if not
 more, than her deserts, she was dexterous to move them to and fro,
 and thus busily scanning her company, soon detected the men who
 regarded her with pleasure. By which means having discovered
 Rinieri's passion, she inly laughed, and said: 'Twill turn out that
 'twas not for nothing that I came here to-day, for, if I mistake not,
 I have caught a gander by the bill. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070009"/>So she gave him an occasional
 sidelong glance, and sought as best she might to make him believe
 that she was not indifferent to him, deeming that the more men she
 might captivate by her charms, the higher those charms would be
 rated, and most especially by him whom she had made lord of them
 and her love. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070010"/>The erudite scholar bade adieu to philosophical meditation,
 for the lady entirely engrossed his mind; and, having discovered
 her house, he, thinking to please her, found divers pretexts
 for frequently passing by it. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070011"/>Whereon the lady, her vanity flattered
 for the reason aforesaid, plumed herself not a little, and shewed herself
 <pb n="211"/>pleased to see him. Thus encouraged, the scholar found means to
 make friends with her maid, to whom he discovered his love, praying
 her to do her endeavour with her mistress, that he might have her
 favour. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070012"/>The maid was profuse of promises, and gave her mistress his
 message, which she no sooner heard, than she was convulsed with
 laughter, and replied: <q>He brought sense enough hither from
 <placeName>Paris</placeName>: knowest thou where he has since been to lose it? Go to,
 now; let us give him that which he seeks. Tell him, when he next
 speaks to you of the matter, that I love him vastly more than he
 loves me, but that I must have regard to my reputation, so that I
 may be able to hold my head up among other ladies; which, if he is
 really the wise man they say, will cause him to affect me much more.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070013"/>Ah! poor woman! poor woman! she little knew, my ladies, how
 rash it is to try conclusions with scholars.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070014"/>The maid found the scholar, and did her mistress's errand. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070015"/>The
 scholar, overjoyed, proceeded to urge his suit with more ardour, to
 indite letters, and send presents. The lady received all that he sent
 her, but vouchsafed no answers save such as were couched in general
 terms: and on this wise she kept him dangling a long while. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070016"/>At last,
 having disclosed the whole affair to her lover, who evinced some
 resentment and jealousy, she, to convince him that his suspicions
 were groundless, and for that she was much importuned by the
 scholar, sent word to him by her maid, that never since he had
 assured her of his love, had occasion served her to do him pleasure,
 but that next Christmastide she hoped to be with him; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070017"/>wherefore, if
 he were minded to await her in the courtyard of her house on the
 night of the day next following the feast, she would meet him there as
 soon as she could. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070018"/>Elated as ne'er another, the scholar hied him at
 the appointed time to the lady's house, and being ushered into a courtyard
 by the maid, who forthwith turned the key upon him, addressed
 himself there to await the lady's coming.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070019"/>Now the lady's lover, by her appointment, was with her that
 evening; and, when they had gaily supped, she told him what she had
 in hand that night, adding: <q>And so thou wilt be able to gauge the
 love which I have borne and bear this scholar, whom thou hast
 foolishly regarded as a rival.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070020"/>The lover heard the lady's words with
 no small delight, and waited in eager expectancy to see her make
 them good. The scholar, hanging about there in the courtyard,
 <pb n="212"/>began to find it somewhat chillier than he would have liked, for it
 had snowed hard all day long, so that the snow lay everywhere
 thick on the ground; however, he bore it patiently, expecting to be
 recompensed by and by. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070021"/>After a while the lady said to her lover:
 <q>Go we to the chamber and take a peep through a lattice at him of
 whom thou art turned jealous, and mark what he does, and how he
 will answer the maid, whom I have bidden go speak with him.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070022"/>So
 the pair hied them to a lattice, wherethrough they could see without
 being seen, and heard the maid call from another lattice to the
 scholar, saying: <q>Rinieri, my lady is distressed as never woman
 was, for that one of her brothers is come here to-night, and after
 talking a long while with her, must needs sup with her, and is not
 yet gone, but, I think, he will soon be off; and that is the reason
 why she has not been able to come to thee, but she will come soon
 now. She trusts it does not irk thee to wait so long.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070023"/>Whereto the
 scholar, supposing that 'twas true, made answer: <q>Tell my lady to
 give herself no anxiety on my account, until she can conveniently
 come to me, but to do so as soon as she may.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070024"/>Whereupon the maid
 withdrew from the window, and went to bed; while the lady said
 to her lover: <q>Now, what sayst thou? Thinkst thou that, if I had
 that regard for him, which thou fearest, I would suffer him to tarry
 below there to get frozen?</q> Which said, the lady and her now
 partly reassured lover got them to bed, where for a great while they
 disported them right gamesomely, laughing together and making
 merry over the luckless scholar.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070025"/>The scholar, meanwhile, paced up and down the courtyard to
 keep himself warm, nor indeed had he where to sit, or take shelter:
 in this plight he bestowed many a curse upon the lady's brother for
 his long tarrying, and never a sound did he hear but he thought that
 'twas the lady opening the door. But vain indeed were his hopes:
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070026"/>the lady, having solaced herself with her lover until hard upon midnight,
 then said to him: <q>How ratest thou our scholar, my soul?
 whether is the greater his wit, or the love I bear him, thinkst thou?
 Will the cold, that, of my ordaining, he now suffers, banish from thy
 breast the suspicion which my light words the other day implanted
 there?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070027"/><q>Ay, indeed, heart of my body!</q> replied the lover, <q>well
 wot I now that even as thou art to me, my weal, my consolation,
 my bliss, so am I to thee.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070028"/><q>So:</q> quoth the lady, <q>then I must
 <pb n="213"/>have full a thousand kisses from thee, to prove that thou sayst
 sooth.</q>
 The lover's answer was to strain her to his heart, and give her not
 merely a thousand but a hundred thousand kisses. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070029"/>In such converse
 they dallied a while longer, and then: <q>Get we up, now,</q> quoth
 the lady, <q>that we may go see if 'tis quite spent, that fire, with
 which, as he wrote to me daily, this new lover of mine used to
 burn.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070030"/>So up they got and hied them to the lattice which they had
 used before, and peering out into the courtyard, saw the scholar
 dancing a hornpipe to the music that his own teeth made, a chattering
 for extremity of cold; nor had they ever seen it footed so nimbly
 and at such a pace. Whereupon: <q>How sayst thou, sweet my
 hope?</q> quoth the lady. <q>Know I not how to make men dance
 without the aid of either trumpet or cornemuse?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070031"/><q>Indeed thou
 dost, my heart's delight,</q> replied the lover. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070032"/>Quoth then the lady:
 <q>I have a mind that we go down to the door. Thou wilt keep
 quiet, and I will speak to him, and we shall hear what he says,
 which, peradventure, we shall find no less diverting than the sight
 of him.</q></p><p>So they stole softly out of the chamber and down to the door,
 which leaving fast closed, the lady set her lips to a little hole that
 was there, and with a low voice called the scholar, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070033"/>who, hearing her
 call him, praised God, making too sure that he was to be admitted,
 and being come to the door, said: <q>Here am I, Madam; open for
 God's sake; let me in, for I die of cold.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070034"/><q>Oh! ay,</q> replied the
 lady, <q>I know thou hast a chill, and of course, there being a little
 snow about, 'tis mighty cold; but well I wot the nights are colder
 far at <placeName>Paris</placeName>. I cannot let thee in as yet, because my accursed
 brother, that came to sup here this evening, is still with me; but he
 will soon take himself off, and then I will let thee in without a
 moment's delay. I have but now with no small difficulty given him
 the slip, to come and give thee heart that the waiting irk thee not.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070035"/><q>Nay but, Madam,</q> replied the scholar, <q>for the love of God, I
 entreat you, let me in, that I may have a roof over my head, because
 for some time past there has been never so thick a fall of snow, and
 'tis yet snowing; and then I will wait as long as you please.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070036"/><q>Alas! sweet my love,</q> quoth the lady, <q>that I may not, for this
 door makes such a din, when one opens it, that my brother would be
 sure to hear, were I to let thee in; but I will go tell him to get him
 <pb n="214"/>gone, and so come back and admit thee.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070037"/><q>Go at once, then,</q>
 returned the scholar, <q>and prithee, see that a good fire be kindled,
 that, when I get in, I may warm myself, for I am now so chilled
 through and through that I have scarce any feeling left.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070038"/><q>That
 can scarce be,</q> rejoined the lady, <q>if it be true, what thou hast so
 protested in thy letters, that thou art all afire for love of me: 'tis
 plain to me now that thou didst but mock me. I now take my leave
 of thee: wait and be of good cheer.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070039"/>So the lady and her lover, who, to his immense delight, had heard
 all that passed, betook them to bed; however, little sleep had they
 that night, but spent the best part of it in disporting themselves and
 making merry over the unfortunate scholar, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070040"/>who, his teeth now
 chattering to such a tune that he seemed to have been metamorphosed
 into a stork, perceived that he had been befooled, and after making
 divers fruitless attempts to open the door and seeking means of egress
 to no better purpose, paced to and fro like a lion, cursing the villainous
 weather, the long night, his simplicity, and the perversity of the
 lady, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070041"/>against whom (the vehemence of his wrath suddenly converting
 the love he had so long borne her to bitter and remorseless enmity)
 he now plotted within himself divers and grand schemes of revenge,
 on which he was far more bent than ever he had been on forgathering
 with her.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070042"/>Slowly the night wore away, and with the first streaks of dawn
 the maid, by her mistress's direction, came down, opened the door of
 the courtyard, and putting on a compassionate air, greeted Rinieri
 with: <q>Foul fall him that came here yestereve; he has afflicted us
 with his presence all night long, and has kept thee a freezing out
 here: but harkye, take it not amiss; that which might not be
 to-night shall be another time: well wot I that nought could have
 befallen that my lady could so ill brook.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070043"/>For all his wrath, the
 scholar, witting, like the wise man he was, that menaces serve but to
 put the menaced on his guard, kept pent within his breast that which
 unbridled resentment would have uttered, and said quietly, and
 without betraying the least trace of anger: 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070044"/><q>In truth 'twas the
 worst night I ever spent, but I understood quite well that the lady
 was in no wise to blame, for that she herself, being moved to pity of
 me, came down here to make her excuses, and to comfort me; and,
 as thou sayst, what has not been to-night will be another time:
 <pb n="215"/>wherefore commend me to her, and so, adieu!</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070045"/>Then, well-nigh
 paralysed for cold, he got him, as best he might, home, where, weary
 and fit to die for drowsiness, he threw himself on his bed, and fell
 into a deep sleep, from which he awoke to find that he had all but
 lost the use of his arms and legs. He therefore sent for some
 physicians, and having told them what a chill he had gotten, caused
 them have a care to his health. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070046"/>But, though they treated him with
 active and most drastic remedies, it cost them some time and no little
 trouble to restore to the cramped muscles their wonted pliancy, and,
 indeed, but for his youth and the milder weather that was at hand,
 'twould have gone very hard with him.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070047"/>However, recover he did his health and lustihood, and nursing
 his enmity, feigned to be vastly more enamoured of his widow than
 ever before. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070048"/>And so it was that after a while Fortune furnished him
 with an opportunity of satisfying his resentment, for the gallant of
 whom the widow was enamoured, utterly regardless of the love she
 bore him, grew enamoured of another lady, and was minded no more
 to pleasure the widow in aught either by word or by deed; wherefore
 she now pined in tears and bitterness of spirit. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070049"/>However, her
 maid, who commiserated her not a little, and knew not how to dispel
 the dumps that the loss of her lover had caused her, espying the
 scholar pass along the street, as he had been wont, conceived the
 silly idea that the lady's lover might be induced to return to his old
 love by some practice of a necromantic order, wherein she doubted
 not that the scholar must be a thorough adept; which idea she
 imparted to her mistress. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070050"/>The lady, being none too well furnished
 with sense, never thinking that, if the scholar had been an adept in
 necromancy, he would have made use of it in his own behoof, gave
 heed to what her maid said, and forthwith bade her learn of the
 scholar whether he would place his skill at her service, and assure
 him that, if he so did, she, in guerdon thereof, would do his pleasure.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070051"/>The maid did her mistress's errand well and faithfully. The scholar
 no sooner heard the message, than he said to himself: Praised be
 Thy name, O God, that the time is now come, when with Thy
 help I may be avenged upon this wicked woman of the wrong she
 did me in requital of the great love I bore her. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070052"/>Then, turning to
 the maid, he said: <q>Tell my lady to set her mind at ease touching
 this matter; for that, were her lover in <placeName>India</placeName>, I would forthwith
 <pb n="216"/>bring him hither to crave her pardon of that wherein he has offended
 her. As to the course she should take in the matter, I tarry but her
 pleasure to make it known to her, when and where she may think
 fit: tell her so, and bid her from me to be of good cheer.</q> The
 maid carried his answer to her mistress, and arranged that they should
 meet in the church of <placeName>Santa Lucia of Prato</placeName>. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070053"/>Thither accordingly
 they came, the lady and the scholar, and conversed apart, and the
 lady, quite oblivious of the ill-usage by which she had well-nigh done
 him to death, opened all her mind to him, and besought him, if he had
 any regard to her welfare, to aid her to the attainment of her desire.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070054"/><q>Madam,</q> replied the scholar, <q>true it is that among other lore
 that I acquired at <placeName>Paris</placeName> was this of necromancy, whereof, indeed, I
 know all that may be known; but, as 'tis in the last degree displeasing
 to God, I had sworn never to practise it either for my own or for any
 other's behoof. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070055"/>'Tis also true that the love I bear you is such that I
 know not how to refuse you aught that you would have me do for
 you; and so, were this single essay enough to consign me to hell,
 I would adventure it to pleasure you. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070056"/>But I mind me that 'tis a
 matter scarce so easy of performance as, perchance, you suppose,
 most especially when a woman would fain recover the love of a man,
 or a man that of a woman, for then it must be done by the postulant
 in proper person, and at night, and in lonely places, and unattended,
 so that it needs a stout heart; nor know I whether you are disposed
 to comply with these conditions.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070057"/>The lady, too enamoured to be
 discreet, made answer: <q>So shrewdly does Love goad me, that
 there is nought I would not do to bring him back to me who wrongfully
 has deserted me; but tell me, prithee, wherein it is that I have
 need of this stout heart.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070058"/><q>Madam,</q> returned the despiteful scholar,
 <q>'twill be my part to fashion in tin an image of him you would fain
 lure back to you: and when I have sent you the image, 'twill be for
 you, when the moon is well on the wane, to dip yourself, being stark
 naked, and the image, seven times in a flowing stream, and this you
 must do quite alone about the hour of first sleep, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070059"/>and afterwards, still
 naked, you must get you upon some tree or some deserted house, and
 facing the North, with the image in your hand, say certain words
 that I shall give you in writing seven times; which, when you have
 done, there will come to you two damsels, the fairest you ever saw,
 who will greet you graciously, and ask of you what you would fain
 <pb n="217"/>have; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070060"/>to whom you will disclose frankly and fully all that you
 crave; and see to it that you make no mistake in the name; and
 when you have said all, they will depart, and you may then descend
 and return to the spot where you left your clothes, and resume them,
 and go home. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070061"/>And rest assured, that before the ensuing midnight
 your lover will come to you in tears, and crave your pardon and
 mercy, and that thenceforth he will never again desert you for any
 other woman.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070062"/>The lady gave entire credence to the scholar's words, and deeming
 her lover as good as in her arms again, recovered half her wonted
 spirits: wherefore: <q>Make no doubt,</q> quoth she, <q>that I shall do
 as thou biddest; and indeed I am most favoured by circumstance;
 for in upper Val d'<placeName>Arno</placeName> I have an estate adjoining the river, and 'tis
 now July, so that to bathe will be delightful. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070063"/>Ay, and now I mind
 me that at no great distance from the river there is a little tower,
 which is deserted, save that now and again the shepherds will get
 them up by the chestnut-wood ladder to the roof, thence to look out
 for their strayed sheep; 'tis a place lonely indeed, and quite out of
 ken; and when I have clomb it, as climb it I will, I doubt not 'twill
 be the best place in all the world to give effect to your
 instructions.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070064"/>Well pleased to be certified of the lady's intention, the scholar,
 to whom her estate and the tower were very well known, made
 answer: <q>I was never in those parts, Madam, and therefore know
 neither your estate nor the tower, but, if 'tis as you say, 'twill certainly
 be the best place in the world for your purpose. So, when
 time shall serve, I will send you the image and the orison. But I
 pray you, when you shall have your heart's desire, and know that
 I have done you good service, do not forget me, but keep your
 promise to me.</q><q>That will I without fail,</q> quoth the lady; and
 so she bade him farewell, and went home. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070065"/>The scholar, gleefully
 anticipating the success of his enterprise, fashioned an image, and
 inscribed it with certain magical signs, and wrote some gibberish
 by way of orison, which in due time he sent to the lady, bidding her
 the very next night do as he had prescribed: and thereupon he
 hied him privily with one of his servants to the house of a friend
 hard by the tower, there to carry his purpose into effect. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070066"/>The lady,
 on her part, set out with her maid, and betook her to her estate, and,
 night being come, sent the maid to bed, as if she were minded to go
 <pb n="218"/>to rest herself; and about the hour of first sleep stole out of the
 house and down to the tower, beside the <placeName>Arno</placeName>; and when, having
 carefully looked about her, she was satisfied that never a soul was to
 be seen or heard, she took off her clothes and hid them under a bush;
 then, with the image in her hand, she dipped herself seven times in
 the river; which done, she hied her with the image to the tower.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070067"/>The scholar, having at nightfall couched himself with his servant
 among the willows and other trees that fringed the bank, marked
 all that she did, and how, as she passed by him, the whiteness of her
 flesh dispelled the shades of night, and scanning attentively her
 bosom and every other part of her body, and finding them very fair,
 felt, as he bethought him what would shortly befall them, some pity
 of her; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070068"/>while, on the other hand, he was suddenly assailed by the
 solicitations of the flesh which caused that to stand which had been
 inert, and prompted him to sally forth of his ambush and take her by
 force, and have his pleasure of her. And, what with his compassion
 and passion, he was like to be worsted; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070069"/>but then, as he bethought
 him who he was, and what a grievous wrong had been done him,
 and for what cause, and by whom, his wrath, thus rekindled, got the
 better of the other affections, so that he swerved not from his resolve,
 but suffered her to go her way.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070070"/>The lady ascended the tower, and standing with her face to the
 North, began to recite the scholar's orison, while he, having stolen
 into the tower but a little behind her, cautiously shifted the ladder
 that led up to the roof on which the lady stood, and waited to
 observe what she would say and do. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070071"/>Seven times the lady said the
 orison, and then awaited the appearance of the two damsels; and so
 long had she to wait--not to mention that the night was a good deal
 cooler than she would have liked--that she saw day break; whereupon,
 disconcerted that it had not fallen out as the scholar had
 promised, she said to herself: I misdoubt me he was minded to
 give me such a night as I gave him; but if such was his intent, he
 is but maladroit in his revenge, for this night is not as long by a third
 as his was, besides which, the cold is of another quality. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070072"/>And that
 day might not overtake her there, she began to think of descending,
 but, finding that the ladder was removed, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070073"/>she felt as if the world had
 come to nought beneath her feet, her senses reeled, and she fell in a
 swoon upon the floor of the roof. When she came to herself, she
 <pb n="219"/>burst into tears and piteous lamentations, and witting now very well
 that 'twas the doing of the scholar, she began to repent her that she
 had first offended him, and then trusted him unduly, having such
 good cause to reckon upon his enmity; in which frame she abode
 long time. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070074"/>Then, searching if haply she might find some means of
 descent, and finding none, she fell a weeping again, and bitterly to
 herself she said: Alas for thee, wretched woman! what will thy
 brothers, thy kinsmen, thy neighbours, nay, what will all <placeName>Florence</placeName>
 say of thee, when 'tis known that thou hast been found here naked?
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070075"/>Thy honour, hitherto unsuspect, will be known to have been but
 a shew, and shouldst thou seek thy defence in lying excuses, if any
 such may be fashioned, the accursed scholar, who knows all thy
 doings, will not suffer it. Ah! poor wretch! that at one and the
 same time hast lost thy too dearly cherished gallant and thine own
 honour! And therewith she was taken with such a transport of
 grief, that she was like to cast herself from the tower to the ground.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070076"/>Then, bethinking her that if she might espy some lad making towards
 the tower with his sheep, she might send him for her maid, for the
 sun was now risen, she approached one of the parapets of the tower,
 and looked out, and so it befell that the scholar, awakening from a
 slumber, in which he had lain a while at the foot of a bush, espied
 her, and she him. Whereupon: <q>Good-day, Madam,</q> quoth he:
 <q>are the damsels yet come?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070077"/>The lady saw and heard him not
 without bursting afresh into a flood of tears, and besought him to
 come into the tower, that she might speak with him: a request which
 the scholar very courteously granted. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070078"/>The lady then threw herself
 prone on the floor of the roof; and, only her head being visible
 through the aperture, thus through her sobs she spoke: <q>Verily,
 Rinieri, if I gave thee a bad night, thou art well avenged on me, for,
 though it be July, meseemed I was sore a cold last night, standing
 here with never a thread upon me, and, besides, I have so bitterly
 bewept both the trick I played thee and my own folly in trusting
 thee, that I marvel that I have still eyes in my head. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070079"/>Wherefore
 I implore thee, not for love of me, whom thou hast no cause to love,
 but for the respect thou hast for thyself as a gentleman, that thou let
 that which thou hast already done suffice thee to avenge the wrong
 I did thee, and bring me my clothes, that I may be able to get me
 down from here, and spare to take from me that which, however
 <pb n="220"/>thou mightst hereafter wish, thou couldst not restore to me, to wit,
 my honour; whereas, if I deprived thee of that one night with me,
 'tis in my power to give thee many another night in recompense
 thereof, and thou hast but to choose thine own times. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070080"/>Let this,
 then, suffice, and like a worthy gentleman be satisfied to have taken
 thy revenge, and to have let me know it: put not forth thy might
 against a woman: 'tis no glory to the eagle to have vanquished a
 dove; wherefore for God's and thine own honour's sake have mercy
 on me.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070081"/>The scholar, albeit his haughty spirit still brooded on her evil
 entreatment of him, yet saw her not weep and supplicate without
 a certain compunction mingling with his exultation; but vengeance
 he had desired above all things, to have wreaked it was indeed sweet,
 and albeit his humanity prompted him to have compassion on the
 hapless woman, yet it availed not to subdue the fierceness of his
 resentment; wherefore thus he made answer: 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070082"/><q>Madam <persName>Elena</persName>,
 had my prayers (albeit art I had none to mingle with them tears
 and honeyed words as thou dost with thine) inclined thee that night,
 when I stood perishing with cold amid the snow that filled thy
 courtyard, to accord me the very least shelter, 'twere but a light
 matter for me to hearken now to thine; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070083"/>but, if thou art now so
 much more careful of thy honour than thou wast wont to be, and
 it irks thee to tarry there naked, address thy prayers to him in whose
 arms it irked thee not naked to pass that night thou mindest thee
 of, albeit thou wist that I with hasty foot was beating time upon
 the snow in thy courtyard to the accompaniment of chattering
 teeth: 'tis he that thou shouldst call to succour thee, to fetch thy
 clothes, to adjust the ladder for thy descent; 'tis he in whom thou
 shouldst labour to inspire this tenderness thou now shewest for thy
 honour, that honour which for his sake thou hast not scrupled to
 jeopardize both now and on a thousand other occasions. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070084"/>Why,
 then, call'st thou not him to come to thy succour? To whom
 pertains it rather than to him? Thou art his. And of whom will
 he have a care, whom will he succour, if not thee? Thou askedst
 him that night, when thou wast wantoning with him, whether
 seemed to him the greater, my folly or the love thou didst bear
 him: call him now, foolish woman, and see if the love thou bearest
 him, and thy wit and his, may avail to deliver thee from my folly.
 <pb n="221"/><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070085"/>'Tis now no longer in thy power to shew me courtesy of that which
 I no more desire, nor yet to refuse it, did I desire it. Reserve thy
 nights for thy lover, if so be thou go hence alive. Be they all thine
 and his. One of them was more than I cared for; 'tis enough for
 me to have been flouted once. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070086"/>Ay, and by thy cunning of speech
 thou strivest might and main to conciliate my good-will, calling me
 worthy gentleman, by which insinuation thou wouldst fain induce
 me magnanimously to desist from further chastisement of thy baseness.
 But thy cajoleries shall not now cloud the eyes of my mind,
 as did once thy false promises. I know myself, and better now for
 thy one night's instruction than for all the time I spent at <placeName>Paris</placeName>.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070087"/>But, granted that I were disposed to be magnanimous, thou art not
 of those to whom 'tis meet to shew magnanimity. A wild beast
 such as thou, having merited vengeance, can claim no relief
 from suffering save death, though in the case of a human being
 'twould suffice to temper vengeance with mercy, as thou saidst.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070088"/>Wherefore I, albeit no eagle, witting thee to be no dove, but a
 venomous serpent, mankind's most ancient enemy, am minded,
 bating no jot of malice or of might, to harry thee to the bitter end:
 natheless this which I do is not properly to be called vengeance but
 rather just retribution; seeing that vengeance should be in excess
 of the offence, and this my chastisement of thee will fall short of
 it; for, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070089"/>were I minded to be avenged on thee, considering what
 account thou madest of my heart and soul, 'twould not suffice me
 to take thy life, no, nor the lives of a hundred others such as thee;
 for I should but slay a vile and base and wicked woman. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070090"/>And
 what the Devil art thou more than any other pitiful baggage, that
 I should spare thy little store of beauty, which a few years will
 ruin, covering thy face with wrinkles? And yet 'twas not for
 want of will that thou didst fail to do to death a worthy gentleman,
 as thou but now didst call me, of whom in a single day of his life
 the world may well have more profit than of a hundred thousand
 like thee while the world shall last. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070091"/>Wherefore by this rude
 discipline I will teach thee what it is to flout men of spirit, and
 more especially what it is to flout scholars, that if thou escape with
 thy life thou mayst have good cause ever hereafter to shun such
 folly. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070092"/>But if thou art so fain to make the descent, why cast not
 thyself down, whereby, God helping, thou wouldst at once
 <pb n="222"/>break thy neck, be quit of the torment thou endurest, and make
 me the happiest man alive? I have no more to say to thee. 'Twas
 my art and craft thus caused thee climb; be it thine to find the
 way down: thou hadst cunning enough, when thou wast minded
 to flout me.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070093"/>While the scholar thus spoke, the hapless lady wept incessantly,
 and before he had done, to aggravate her misery, the sun was high
 in the heaven. However, when he was silent, thus she made
 answer: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070094"/><q>Ah! ruthless man, if that accursed night has so rankled
 with thee, and thou deemest my fault so grave that neither my youth
 and beauty, nor my bitter tears, nor yet my humble supplications may
 move thee to pity, let this at least move thee, and abate somewhat
 of thy remorseless severity, that 'twas my act alone, in that of late
 I trusted thee, and discovered to thee all my secret, that did open
 the way to compass thy end, and make me cognizant of my guilt,
 seeing that, had I not confided in thee, on no wise mightst thou
 have been avenged on me; which thou wouldst seem so ardently
 to have desired. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070095"/>Turn thee, then, turn thee, I pray thee, from thy
 wrath, and pardon me. So thou wilt pardon me, and get me down
 hence, right gladly will I give up for ever my faithless gallant, and
 thou shalt be my sole lover and lord, albeit thou sayst hard things
 of my beauty, slight and shortlived as thou wouldst have it to be,
 which, however it may compare with others, is, I wot, to be prized,
 if for no other reason, yet for this, that 'tis the admiration
 and solace and delight of young men, and thou art not yet old.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070096"/>And albeit I have been harshly treated by thee, yet believe I cannot
 that thou wouldst have me do myself so shamefully to death as to
 cast me down, like some abandoned wretch, before thine eyes, in
 which, unless thou wast then, as thou hast since shewn thyself, a
 liar, I found such favour. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070097"/>Ah! have pity on me for God's and
 mercy's sake! The sun waxes exceeding hot, and having suffered
 not a little by the cold of last night, I now begin to be sorely afflicted
 by the heat.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070098"/><q>Madam,</q> rejoined the scholar, who held her in parley with no
 small delight, <q>'twas not for any love that thou didst bear me that
 thou trustedst me, but that thou mightst recover that which thou
 hadst lost, for which cause thou meritest but the greater punishment;
 and foolish indeed art thou if thou supposest that such was the sole
 <pb n="223"/>means available for my revenge. I had a thousand others, and, while
 I feigned to love thee, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070099"/>I had laid a thousand gins for thy feet, into
 one or other of which in no long time, though this had not occurred,
 thou must needs have fallen, and that too to thy more grievous
 suffering and shame; nor was it to spare thee, but that I might be
 the sooner rejoiced by thy discomfiture that I took my present
 course. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070100"/>And though all other means had failed me, I had still the
 pen, with which I would have written of thee such matters and in
 such a sort, that when thou wist them, as thou shouldst have done,
 thou wouldst have regretted a thousand times that thou hadst ever
 been born. The might of the pen is greater far than they suppose,
 who have not proved it by experience. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070101"/>By God I swear,
 so may He, who has prospered me thus far in this my revenge,
 prosper me to the end! that I would have written of thee things
 that would have so shamed thee in thine own--not to speak of
 others'--sight that thou hadst put out thine eyes that thou mightst
 no more see thyself; wherefore chide not the sea, for that it has
 sent forth a tiny rivulet. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070102"/>For thy love, or whether thou be mine or
 no, nought care I. Be thou still his, whose thou hast been, if thou
 canst. Hate him as I once did, I now love him, by reason of his
 present entreatment of thee. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070103"/>Ye go getting you enamoured, ye
 women, and nought will satisfy you but young gallants, because ye
 mark that their flesh is ruddier, and their beards are blacker, than other
 folk's, and that they carry themselves well, and foot it featly in the
 dance, and joust; but those that are now more mature were even as
 they, and possess a knowledge which they have yet to acquire. And
 therewithal ye deem that they ride better, and cover more miles in a
 day, than men of riper age. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070104"/>Now that they dust the pelisse with
 more vigour I certainly allow, but their seniors, being more experienced,
 know better the places where the fleas lurk; and spare and
 dainty diet is preferable to abundance without savour: moreover
 hard trotting will gall and jade even the youngest, whereas an easy
 pace, though it bring one somewhat later to the inn, at any rate
 brings one thither fresh. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070105"/>Ye discern not, witless creatures that ye
 are, how much of evil this little shew of bravery serves to hide.
 Your young gallant is never content with one woman, but lusts
 after as many as he sets eyes on; nor is there any but he deems
 himself worthy of her: wherefore 'tis not possible that their love
 <pb n="224"/>should be lasting, as thou hast but now proved and mayst only too
 truly witness. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070106"/>Moreover to be worshipped, to be caressed by their
 ladies they deem but their due; nor is there aught whereon they
 plume and boast them so proudly as their conquests: which impertinence
 has caused not a few women to surrender to the friars, who
 keep their own counsel. Peradventure thou wilt say that never a
 soul save thy maid and I wist aught of thy loves; but, if so, thou
 hast been misinformed, and if thou so believest, thou dost misbelieve.
 Scarce aught else is talked of either in his quarter or in thine; but
 most often 'tis those most concerned whose ears such matters reach
 last. Moreover, they rob you, these young gallants, whereas the
 others make you presents. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070107"/>So, then, having made a bad choice, be
 thou still his to whom thou hast given thyself, and leave me, whom
 thou didst flout, to another, for I have found a lady of much greater
 charms than thine, and that has understood me better than thou
 didst. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070108"/>And that thou mayst get thee to the other world better
 certified of the desire of my eyes than thou wouldst seem to be here
 by my words, delay no more, but cast thyself down, whereby thy
 soul, taken forthwith, as I doubt not she will be, into the embrace
 of the Devil, may see whether thy headlong fall afflicts mine eyes, or
 no. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070109"/>But, for that I doubt thou meanest not thus to gladden me,
 I bid thee, if thou findest the sun begin to scorch thee, remember the
 cold thou didst cause me to endure, wherewith, by admixture, thou
 mayst readily temper the sun's heat.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070110"/>The hapless lady, seeing that the scholar's words were ever to the
 same ruthless effect, burst afresh into tears, and said: <q>Lo, now,
 since nought that pertains to me may move thee, be thou at least
 moved by the love thou bearest this lady of whom thou speakest, who,
 thou sayst, is wiser than I, and loves thee, and for love of her pardon me,
 and fetch me my clothes, that I may resume them, and get me down
 hence.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070111"/>Whereat the scholar fell a laughing, and seeing that 'twas
 not a little past tierce, made answer: <q>Lo, now, I know not how
 to deny thee, adjuring me as thou dost by such a lady: tell me, then,
 where thy clothes are, and I will go fetch them, and bring thee
 down.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070112"/>The lady, believing him, was somewhat comforted, and
 told him where she had laid her clothes. The scholar then quitted
 the tower, bidding his servant on no account to stir from his post,
 but to keep close by, and, as best he might, bar the tower against all
 <pb n="225"/>comers until his return: which said, he betook him to the house of
 his friend, where he breakfasted much at his ease, and thereafter
 went to sleep. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070113"/>Left alone upon the tower, the lady, somewhat
 cheered by her fond hope, but still exceeding sorrowful, drew nigh
 to a part of the wall where there was a little shade, and there sate
 down to wait. And now lost in most melancholy brooding, now
 dissolved in tears, now plunged in despair of ever seeing the scholar
 return with her clothes, but never more than a brief while in any one
 mood, spent with grief and the night's vigil, she by and by fell asleep.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070114"/>The sun was now in the zenith, and smote with extreme fervour
 full and unmitigated upon her tender and delicate frame, and upon
 her bare head, insomuch that his rays did not only scorch but bit by
 bit excoriate every part of her flesh that was exposed to them, and so
 shrewdly burn her that, albeit she was in a deep sleep, the pain
 awoke her. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070115"/>And as by reason thereof she writhed a little, she felt
 the scorched skin part in sunder and shed itself, as will happen when
 one tugs at a parchment that has been singed by the fire, while her
 head ached so sore that it seemed like to split, and no wonder. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070116"/>Nor
 might she find place either to lie or to stand on the floor of the roof,
 but ever went to and fro, weeping. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070117"/>Besides which there stirred not
 the least breath of wind, and flies and gadflies did swarm in prodigious
 quantity, which, settling upon her excoriate flesh, stung her so shrewdly
 that 'twas as if she received so many stabs with a javelin, and she was
 ever restlessly feeling her sores with her hands, and cursing herself,
 her life, her lover, and the scholar.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070118"/>Thus by the exorbitant heat of the sun, by the flies and gadflies,
 harassed, goaded, and lacerated, tormented also by hunger, and yet
 more by thirst, and thereto by a thousand distressful thoughts, she
 planted herself erect on her feet, and looked about her, if haply she
 might see or hear any one, with intent, come what might, to call
 to him and crave his succour. But even this hostile Fortune had
 disallowed her. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070119"/>The husbandmen were all gone from the fields by
 reason of the heat, and indeed there had come none to work that
 day in the neighbourhood of the tower, for that all were employed in
 threshing their corn beside their cottages: wherefore she heard but
 the cicalas, while <placeName>Arno</placeName>, tantalizing her with the sight of his waters,
 increased rather than diminished her thirst. Ay, and in like manner,
 wherever she espied a copse, or a patch of shade, or a house, 'twas a
 <pb n="226"/>torment to her, for the longing she had for it. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070120"/>What more is to be
 said of this hapless woman? Only this: that what with the heat of
 the sun above and the floor beneath her, and the scarification of her
 flesh in every part by the flies and gadflies, that flesh, which in the
 night had dispelled the gloom by its whiteness, was now become red
 as madder, and so besprent with clots of blood, that whoso had seen
 her would have deemed her the most hideous object in the world.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070121"/>Thus resourceless and hopeless, she passed the long hours, expecting
 death rather than aught else, until half none was come and gone;
 when, his siesta ended, the scholar bethought him of his lady, and
 being minded to see how she fared, hied him back to the tower, and
 sent his servant away to break his fast. As soon as the lady espied
 him, she came, spent and crushed by her sore affliction, to the aperture,
 and thus addressed him: 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070122"/><q>Rinieri, the cup of thy vengeance
 is full to overflowing: for if I gave thee a night of freezing in my
 courtyard, thou hast given me upon this tower a day of scorching,
 nay, of burning, and therewithal of perishing of hunger and thirst:
 wherefore, by God I entreat thee to come up hither, and as my heart
 fails me to take my life, take it thou, for 'tis death I desire of all
 things, such and so grievous is my suffering. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070123"/>But if this grace thou
 wilt not grant, at least bring me a cup of water wherewith to lave
 my mouth, for which my tears do not suffice, so parched and torrid is
 it within.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070124"/>Well wist the scholar by her voice how spent she was;
 he also saw a part of her body burned through and through by the
 sun; whereby, and by reason of the lowliness of her entreaties, he
 felt some little pity for her; but all the same he made answer:
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070125"/><q>Nay, wicked woman, 'tis not by my hands thou shalt die; thou
 canst die by thine own whenever thou art so minded; and to temper
 thy heat thou shalt have just as much water from me as I had fire
 from thee to mitigate my cold. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070126"/>I only regret that for the cure of
 my chill the physicians were fain to use foul-smelling muck, whereas
 thy burns can be treated with fragrant rose-water; and that, whereas
 I was like to lose my muscles and the use of my limbs, thou, for all
 thy excoriation by the heat, wilt yet be fair again, like a snake that
 has sloughed off the old skin.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070127"/><q>Alas! woe's me!</q> replied the
 lady, <q>for charms acquired at such a cost, God grant them to those
 that hate me. But thou, most fell of all wild beasts, how hast thou
 borne thus to torture me? What more had I to expect of thee or
 <pb n="227"/>any other, had I done all thy kith and kin to death with direst
 torments? <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070128"/>Verily, I know not what more cruel suffering thou
 couldst have inflicted on a traitor that had put a whole city to the
 slaughter than this which thou hast allotted to me, to be thus roasted,
 and devoured of the flies, and therewithal to refuse me even a cup of
 water, though the very murderers condemned to death by the law,
 as they go to execution, not seldom are allowed wine to drink, so they
 but ask it. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070129"/>Lo now, I see that thou art inexorable in thy ruthlessness,
 and on no wise to be moved by my suffering: wherefore with
 resignation I will compose me to await death, that God may have
 mercy on my soul. And may this that thou doest escape not the
 searching glance of His just eyes.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070130"/>Which said, she dragged herself,
 sore suffering, toward the middle of the floor, despairing of ever
 escaping from her fiery torment, besides which, not once only, but a
 thousand times she thought to choke for thirst, and ever she wept
 bitterly and bewailed her evil fate. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070131"/>But at length the day wore to
 vespers, and the scholar, being sated with his revenge, caused his
 servant to take her clothes and wrap them in his cloak, and hied him
 with the servant to the hapless lady's house, where, finding her maid
 sitting disconsolate and woebegone and resourceless at the door:
 <q>Good woman,</q> quoth he, <q>what has befallen thy mistress?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070132"/>Whereto: <q>Sir, I know not,</q> replied the maid. <q>I looked to find
 her this morning abed, for methought she went to bed last night,
 but neither there nor anywhere else could I find her, nor know I
 what is become of her; wherefore exceeding great is my distress;
 but have you, Sir, nought to say of the matter?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070133"/><q>Only this,</q>
 returned the scholar, <q>that I would I had had thee with her there
 where I have had her, that I might have requited thee of thy offence,
 even as I have requited her of hers. But be assured that thou shalt
 not escape my hands, until thou hast from me such wage of thy
 labour that thou shalt never flout man more, but thou shalt mind
 thee of me.</q> Then, turning to his servant, he said: <q>Give her
 these clothes, and tell her that she may go bring her mistress away,
 if she will.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070134"/>The servant did his bidding; and the maid, what
 with the message and her recognition of the clothes, was mightily
 afraid, lest they had slain the lady, and scarce suppressing a shriek,
 took the clothes, and, bursting into tears, set off, as soon as the
 scholar was gone, at a run for the tower.</p><pb n="228"/><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070135"/>Now one of the lady's husbandmen had had the misfortune to
 lose two of his hogs that day, and, seeking them, came to the tower
 not long after the scholar had gone thence, and peering about in all
 quarters, if haply he might have sight of his hogs, heard the woeful
 lamentation that the hapless lady made, and got him up into the
 tower, and called out as loud as he might: <q>Who wails up there?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070136"/>The lady recognized her husbandman's voice, and called him by
 name, saying: <q>Prithee, go fetch my maid, and cause her come
 up hither to me.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070137"/>The husbandman, knowing her by her voice,
 replied: <q>Alas! Madam, who set you there? Your maid has
 been seeking you all day long: but who would ever have supposed
 that you were there?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070138"/>Whereupon he took the props of the ladder,
 and set them in position, and proceeded to secure the rounds to
 them with withies. Thus engaged he was found by the maid, who,
 as she entered the tower, beat her face and breast, and unable longer
 to keep silence, cried out: <q>Alas, sweet my lady, where are you?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070139"/>Whereto the lady made answer as loud as she might: <q>O my sister,
 here above am I, weep not, but fetch me my clothes forthwith.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070140"/>Well-nigh
 restored to heart, to hear her mistress's voice, the maid, assisted
 by the husbandman, ascended the ladder, which he had now all but
 set in order, and gaining the roof, and seeing her lady lie there
 naked, spent and fordone, and liker to a half-burned stump than to a
 human being, she planted her nails in her face and fell a weeping
 over her, as if she were a corpse. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070141"/>However, the lady bade her for
 God's sake be silent, and help her to dress, and having learned from
 her that none knew where she had been, save those that had brought
 her her clothes and the husbandman that was there present, was
 somewhat consoled, and besought her for God's sake to say nought
 of the matter to any. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070142"/>Thus long time they conversed, and then
 the husbandman took the lady on his shoulders, for walk she could
 not, and bore her safely out of the tower. The unfortunate maid,
 following after with somewhat less caution, slipped, and falling from
 the ladder to the ground, broke her thigh, and roared for pain like
 any lion. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070143"/>So the husbandman set the lady down upon a grassy mead,
 while he went to see what had befallen the maid, whom, finding her
 thigh broken, he brought, and laid beside the lady: who, seeing her
 woes completed by this last misfortune, and that she of whom, most
 of all, she had expected succour, was lamed of a thigh, was distressed
 <pb n="229"/>beyond measure, and wept again so piteously that not only was the
 husbandman powerless to comfort her, but was himself fain to weep.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070144"/>However, as the sun was now low, that they might not be there
 surprised by night, he, with the disconsolate lady's approval, hied him
 home, and called to his aid two of his brothers and his wife, who
 returned with him, bearing a plank, whereon they laid the maid, and
 so they carried her to the lady's house. There, by dint of cold
 water and words of cheer, they restored some heart to the lady,
 whom the husbandman then took upon his shoulders, and bore to her
 chamber. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070145"/>The husbandman's wife fed her with sops of bread, and
 then undressed her, and put her to bed. They also provided the
 means to carry her and the maid to <placeName>Florence</placeName>; and so 'twas done.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070146"/>There the lady, who was very fertile in artifices, invented an entirely
 fictitious story of what had happened as well in regard of her maid
 as of herself, whereby she persuaded both her brothers and her sisters
 and every one else, that 'twas all due to the enchantments of evil
 spirits. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070147"/>The physicians lost no time, and, albeit the lady's suffering
 and mortification were extreme, for she left more than one skin sticking
 to the sheets, they cured her of a high fever, and certain attendant
 maladies; as also the maid of her fractured thigh. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070148"/>The end of all
 which was that the lady forgot her lover, and having learned discretion,
 was thenceforth careful neither to love nor to flout; and the
 scholar, learning that the maid had broken her thigh, deemed his
 vengeance complete, and was satisfied to say never a word more of
 the affair. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08070149"/>Such then were the consequences of her flouts to this
 foolish young woman, who deemed that she might trifle with a
 scholar with the like impunity as with others, not duly understanding
 that they--I say not all, but the more part--know where the Devil
 keeps his tail.<note><!--(i)-->I.e.<!--(/i)--> are a match for the Devil himself in

 as I have heard tell, there dwelt two young men of good substance,
 and, for plebeians, of good family, the one Spinelloccio Tanena, the
 other Zeppa di Mino, by name; who, their houses being contiguous
 in the <placeName>Camollia</placeName>,<note>A suburb of <placeName>Siena</placeName>.</note><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08080005"/>kept ever together, and, by
 what appeared, loved
 each other as brothers, or even more so, and had each a very fine
 <pb n="231"/>woman to wife. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08080006"/>Now it so befell that Spinelloccio, being much in
 Zeppa's house, as well when Zeppa was not, as when he was there,
 grew so familiar with Zeppa's wife, that he sometimes lay with her;
 and on this wise they continued to forgather a great while before any
 one was ware of it. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08080007"/>However, one of these days Zeppa being at
 home, though the lady wist it not, Spinelloccio came in quest of
 him; and, the lady sending word that he was not at home, he forthwith
 went upstairs and found the lady in the saloon, and seeing none
 else there, kissed her, as did she him.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08080008"/>Zeppa saw all that passed, but said nothing and kept close, being
 minded to see how the game would end, and soon saw his wife and
 Spinelloccio, still in one another's arms, hie them to her chamber and
 lock themselves in: whereat he was mightily incensed. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08080009"/>But, witting
 that to make a noise, or do aught else overt, would not lessen but
 rather increase his dishonour, he cast about how he might be avenged
 on such wise that, without the affair getting wind, he might content
 his soul; and having, after long pondering, hit, as he thought, upon
 the expedient, he budged not from his retreat, until Spinelloccio had
 parted from the lady. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08080010"/>Whereupon he hied him into the chamber,
 and there finding the lady with her head-gear, which Spinelloccio in
 toying with her had disarranged, scarce yet readjusted: <q>Madam,
 what dost thou?</q> quoth he. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08080011"/>Whereto: <q>Why, dost not see?</q>
 returned the lady. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08080012"/><q>Troth do I,</q> rejoined he, <q>and somewhat else
 have I seen that I would I had not.</q> And so he questioned her of
 what had passed, and she, being mightily afraid, did after long parley
 confess that which she might not plausibly deny, to wit, her intimacy
 with Spinelloccio, and fell a beseeching him with tears to pardon her.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08080013"/><q>Lo, now, wife,</q> quoth Zeppa, <q>thou hast done wrong, and, so thou
 wouldst have me pardon thee, have a care to do exactly as I shall bid
 thee; to wit, on this wise: 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08080014"/>thou must tell Spinelloccio to find some
 occasion to part from me to-morrow morning about tierce, and come
 hither to thee; and while he is here I will come back, and when
 thou hearest me coming, thou wilt get him into this chest, and lock
 him in there; which when thou hast done, I will tell thee what else
 thou hast to do, which thou mayst do without the least misgiving,
 for I promise thee I will do him no harm.</q> The lady, to content
 him, promised to do as he bade, and she kept her word.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08080015"/>The morrow came, and Zeppa and Spinelloccio being together
 <pb n="232"/>about tierce, Spinelloccio, having promised the lady to come to see
 her at that hour, said to Zeppa: <q>I must go breakfast with a
 friend, whom I had life not keep in waiting; therefore, adieu!</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08080016"/><q>Nay, but,</q> quoth Zeppa, <q>'tis not yet breakfast-time.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08080017"/><q>No
 matter,</q> returned Spinelloccio, <q>I have business on which I must
 speak with him; so I must be in good time.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08080018"/>Whereupon Spinelloccio
 took his leave of Zeppa, and having reached Zeppa's house by
 a slightly circuitous route, and finding his wife there, was taken by
 her into the chamber, where they had not been long together when
 Zeppa returned. Hearing him come, the lady, feigning no small
 alarm, bundled Spinelloccio into the chest, as her husband had bidden
 her, and having locked him in, left him there. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08080019"/>As Zeppa came
 upstairs: <q>Wife,</q> quoth he, <q>is it breakfast time?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08080020"/><q>Ay, husband, 'tis so,</q> replied the lady. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08080021"/>Whereupon: <q>Spinelloccio is
 gone to breakfast with a friend to-day,</q> quoth Zeppa, <q>leaving his
 wife at home: get thee to the window, and call her, and bid her
 come and breakfast with us.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08080022"/>The lady, whose fear for herself made
 her mighty obedient, did as her husband bade her; and after much
 pressing Spinelloccio's wife came to breakfast with them, though she
 was given to understand that her husband would not be of the company.
 So, she being come, Zeppa received her most affectionately,
 and taking her familiarly by the hand, bade his wife, in an undertone,
 get her to the kitchen; he then led Spinelloccio's wife into the
 chamber, and locked the door. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08080023"/>Hearing the key turn in the lock:
 <q>Alas!</q> quoth the lady, <q>what means this, Zeppa? Is't for this you
 have brought me here? Is this the love you bear Spinelloccio? Is
 this your loyalty to him as your friend and comrade?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08080024"/>By the time
 she had done speaking, Zeppa, still keeping fast hold of her, was
 beside the chest, in which her husband was locked. Wherefore:
 <q>Madam,</q> quoth he, <q>spare me thy reproaches, until thou hast
 heard what I have to say to thee. I have loved, I yet love, Spinelloccio
 as a brother; and yesterday, though he knew it not, I discovered
 that the trust I reposed in him has for its guerdon that he
 lies with my wife, as with thee. Now, for that I love him, I purpose
 not to be avenged upon him save in the sort in which he
 offended. He has had my wife, and I intend to have thee. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08080025"/>So thou
 wilt not grant me what I crave of thee, be sure I shall not fail to
 take it; and having no mind to let this affront pass unavenged, will
 <pb n="233"/>make such play with him that neither thou nor he shall ever be
 happy again.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08080026"/>The lady hearkening, and by dint of his repeated
 asseverations coming at length to believe him: <q>Zeppa mine,</q>
 quoth she, <q>as this thy vengeance is to light upon me, well content
 am I; so only thou let not this which we are to do embroil me with
 thy wife, with whom, notwithstanding the evil turn she has done
 me, I am minded to remain at peace.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08080027"/><q>Have no fear on that
 score,</q> replied Zeppa; <q>nay, I will give thee into the bargain a
 jewel so rare and fair that thou hast not the like.</q> Which said,
 he took her in his arms and fell a kissing her, and having laid her
 on the chest, in which her husband was safe under lock and key,
 did there disport himself with her to his heart's content, as she with
 him.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08080028"/>Spinelloccio in the chest heard all that Zeppa had said, and how
 he was answered by the lady, and the Trevisan dance that afterwards
 went on over his head; whereat his mortification was such that for
 a great while he scarce hoped to live through it; and, but for the fear
 he had of Zeppa, he would have given his wife a sound rating, close
 prisoner though he was. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08080029"/>But, as he bethought him that 'twas he
 that had given the first affront, and that Zeppa had good cause for
 acting as he did, and that he had dealt with him considerately and
 as a good fellow should, he resolved that if it were agreeable to
 Zeppa, they should be faster friends than ever before. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08080030"/>However,
 Zeppa, having had his pleasure with the lady, got down from the
 chest, and being reminded by the lady of his promise of the jewel,
 opened the door of the chamber and brought his wife in. Quoth
 she with a laugh: <q>Madam, you have given me tit for tat,</q> and
 never a word more. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08080031"/>Whereupon: <q>Open the chest,</q> quoth
 Zeppa; and she obeying, he shewed the lady her Spinelloccio lying
 therein. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08080032"/>'Twould be hard to say whether of the twain was the
 more shame-stricken, Spinelloccio to be confronted with Zeppa,
 knowing that Zeppa wist what he had done, or the lady to meet her
 husband's eyes, knowing that he had heard what went on above his
 head. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08080033"/><q>Lo, here is the jewel I give thee,</q> quoth Zeppa to her,
 pointing to Spinelloccio, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08080034"/>who, as he came forth of the chest, blurted
 out: <q>Zeppa, we are quits, and so 'twere best, as thou saidst a while
 ago to my wife, that we still be friends as we were wont, and as we
 had nought separate, save our wives, that henceforth we have them
 <pb n="234"/>also in common.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08080035"/><q>Content,</q> quoth Zeppa; and so in perfect
 peace and accord they all four breakfasted together. And thenceforth
 each of the ladies had two husbands, and each of the husbands two
 wives; nor was there ever the least dispute or contention between
 them on that score.</p></div><pb n="235"/><!--******************************Novella 9********************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0809"><head>Novel IX</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090001"/><!--(i)-->Bruno and Buffalmacco prevail upon Master Simone, a

 from <placeName>Bologna</placeName>, this man a judge, that a physician, and the other
 a notary, flaunting it in ample flowing robes, and adorned with the
 scarlet and the vair and other array most goodly to see; and how
 far their doings correspond with this fair seeming, is also matter of
 daily experience. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090005"/>Among whom 'tis not long since Master Simone
 da Villa, one whose patrimony was more ample than his knowledge,
 came back wearing the scarlet and a broad stripe<note>The distinguishing

 of a doctor in those days. Fanfani, <!--(i)-->Vocab. della Lingua Italiana<!--(/i)-->,

 <q>Batolo.</q></note> on the shoulder, and

 we said, come back, had this among other singular habits, that he could
 never see a soul pass along the street, but he must needs ask any that
 was by, who that man was; and he was as observant of all the doings
 of men, and as sedulous to store his memory with such matters, as
 if they were to serve him to compound the drugs that he was to give
 his patients. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090007"/>Now, of all that he saw, those that he eyed most observantly
 were two painters, of whom here to-day mention has twice
 been made, Bruno, to wit, and Buffalmacco, who were ever together,
 and were his neighbours. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090008"/>And as it struck him that they daffed the
 world aside and lived more lightheartedly than any others that he
 knew, as indeed they did, he enquired of not a few folk as to their
 rank. And learning on all hands that they were poor men and
 painters, he could not conceive it possible that they should live thus
 contentedly in poverty, but made his mind up that, being, as he was
 informed, clever fellows, they must have some secret source from
 which they drew immense gains; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090009"/>for which reason he grew all agog
 to get on friendly terms with them, or any rate with one of them,
 and did succeed in making friends with Bruno.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090010"/>Bruno, who had not needed to be much with him in order to
 discover that this physician was but a dolt, had never such a jolly
 time in palming off his strange stories upon him, while the physician,
 on his part, was marvellously delighted with Bruno; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090011"/>to whom, having
 bidden him to breakfast, and thinking that for that reason he might
 talk familiarly with him, he expressed the amazement with which
 he regarded both him and Buffalmacco, for that, being but poor men,
 they lived so lightheartedly, and asked him to tell him how they
 managed. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090012"/>At which fresh proof of the doctor's simplicity and
 fatuity Bruno was inclined to laugh; but, bethinking him that
 'twere best to answer him according to his folly, he said: <q>Master,
 there are not many persons to whom I would disclose our manner
 of life, but, as you are my friend, and I know you will not let it go
 further, I do not mind telling you. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090013"/>The fact is that my comrade
 and I live not only as lightheartedly and jovially as you see, but
 much more so; and yet neither our art, nor any property that we

 have you suppose that we go a thieving: no, 'tis that we go the

 that we need, nay, all that we desire; and thus it is that we live so
 lightheartedly as you see.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090014"/>Which explanation the doctor believing
 none the less readily that he knew not what it meant, was lost in
 wonder, and forthwith burned with a most vehement desire to know
 what going the course might be, and was instant with Bruno to
 expound it, assuring him that he would never tell a soul. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090015"/><q>Alas!

 the respect in which I hold your quiditative pumpionship of <placeName>Legnaia</placeName>,
 and the trust I repose in you, that I am not able to deny you aught

<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090017"/>Whereupon: <q>You
 are then to know,</q> quoth Bruno, <q>sweet my Master, that 'tis not
 long since there was in this city a great master in necromancy, hight
 Michael Scott, for that he was of <placeName>Scotland</placeName>, and great indeed was the
 honour in which he was held by not a few gentlemen, most of whom
 are now dead; and when the time came that he must needs depart
 from <placeName>Florence</placeName>, he at their instant entreaty left behind him two
 pupils, adepts both, whom he bade hold themselves ever ready to
 pleasure those gentlemen who had done him honour. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090018"/>And very
 handsomely they did serve the said gentlemen in certain of their love
 affairs and other little matters; and finding the city and the manners
 of the citizens agreeable to them, they made up their minds to stay
 here always, and grew friendly and very intimate with some of the
 citizens, making no distinction between gentle and simple, rich or
 poor, so only they were such as were conformable to their ways.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090019"/>And to gratify these their friends they formed a company of perhaps
 twenty-five men, to meet together at least twice a month in a place
 appointed by them; where, when they are met, each utters his
 desire, and forthwith that same night they accomplish it. Now
 Buffalmacco and I, being extraordinarily great and close friends with
 <pb n="238"/>these two adepts, were by them enrolled in this company, and are
 still members of it. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090020"/>And I assure you that, as often as we are
 assembled together, the adornments of the saloon in which we eat
 are a marvel to see, ay, and the tables laid as for kings, and the
 multitudes of stately and handsome servants, as well women as men,
 at the beck and call of every member of the company, and the basins,
 and the ewers, the flasks and the cups, and all else that is there for
 our service in eating and drinking, of nought but gold and silver, and
 therewithal the abundance and variety of the viands, suited to the
 taste of each, that are set before us, each in due course, these too be
 marvels. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090021"/>'Twere vain for me to seek to describe to you the sweet
 concord that is there of innumerable instruments of music, and the
 tuneful songs that salute our ears; nor might I hope to tell you how
 much wax is burned at these banquets, or compute the quantity of the
 comfits that are eaten, or the value of the wines that are drunk.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090022"/>Nor, my pumpkin o' wit, would I have you suppose that, when we
 are there, we wear our common clothes, such as you now see me
 wear; nay, there is none there so humble but he shews as an
 emperor, so sumptuous are our garments, so splendid our trappings.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090023"/>But among all the delights of the place none may compare with the
 fair ladies, who, so one do but wish, are brought thither from every
 part of the world. Why, you might see there My Lady of the
 Barbanichs, the Queen of the Basques, the Consort of the Soldan,
 the Empress of Osbech, the Ciancianfera of Nornieca, the Semistante
 of <placeName>Berlinzone</placeName>, and the Scalpedra of <placeName>Narsia</placeName>. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090024"/>But why seek to enumerate
 them all? They include all the queens in the world, ay, even to
 the Schinchimurra of Prester John, who has the horns sprouting out
 of her nether end: so there's for you. Now when these ladies have
 done with the wine and the comfits, they tread a measure or two,
 each with the man at whose behest she is come, and then all go with
 their gallants to their chambers. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090025"/>And know that each of these
 chambers shews as a very Paradise, so fair is it, ay, and no less
 fragrant than the cases of aromatics in your shop when you are
 pounding the cumin: and therein are beds that you would find more
 goodly than that of the Doge of <placeName>Venice</placeName>, and 'tis in them we take
 our rest; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090026"/>and how busily they ply the treadle, and how lustily they
 tug at the frame to make the stuff close and compact, I leave you to
 imagine. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090027"/>However, among the luckiest of all I reckon Buffalmacco
 <pb n="239"/>and myself; for that Buffalmacco for the most part fetches him the
 Queen of <placeName>France</placeName>, and I do the like with the Queen of <placeName>England</placeName>, who
 are just the finest women in the world, and we have known how to
 carry it with them so that we are the very eyes of their heads. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090028"/>So
 I leave it to your own judgment to determine whether we have not
 good cause to live and bear ourselves with a lighter heart than others,
 seeing that we are beloved of two such great queens, to say nothing
 of the thousand or two thousand florins that we have of them whenever
 we are so minded. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090029"/>Now this in the vulgar we call going the
 course, because, as the corsairs prey upon all the world, so do we;
 albeit with this difference, that, whereas they never restore their spoil,
 we do so as soon as we have done with it. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090030"/>So now, my worthy
 Master, you understand what we mean by going the course; but
 how close it behoves you to keep such a secret, you may see for
 yourself; so I spare you any further exhortations.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090031"/>The Master, whose skill did not reach, perhaps, beyond the treatment
 of children for the scurf, took all that Bruno said for gospel,
 and burned with so vehement a desire to be admitted into this company,
 that he could not have longed for the <!--(i)-->summum bonum<!--(/i)--> itself
 with more ardour. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090032"/>So, after telling Bruno that indeed 'twas no
 wonder they bore them lightheartedly, he could scarce refrain from
 asking him there and then to have him enrolled, albeit he deemed it
 more prudent to defer his suit, until by lavishing honour upon him
 he had gained a right to urge it with more confidence. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090033"/>He therefore
 made more and more of him, had him to breakfast and sup with
 him, and treated him with extraordinary respect. In short, such and
 so constant was their intercourse that it seemed as though the Master
 wist not how to live without Bruno. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090034"/>As it went so well with him,
 Bruno, to mark his sense of the honour done him by the doctor,
 painted in his saloon a picture symbolical of Lent, and an Agnus
 Dei at the entrance of his chamber, and an alembic over his front
 door, that those who would fain consult him might know him from
 other physicians, besides a battle of rats and mice in his little gallery,
 which the doctor thought an extremely fine piece. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090035"/>And from time
 to time, when he had not supped with the Master, he would say to
 him: <q>Last night I was with the company, and being a little tired
 of the Queen of <placeName>England</placeName>, I fetched me the Gumedra of the great
	Can of Tarisi.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090036"/><q>Gumedra,</q> quoth the Master; <q>what is she?
 <pb n="240"/>I know not the meaning of these words.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090037"/><q>Thereat, Master,</q>
 replied Bruno, <q>I marvel not; for I have heard tell that neither
 Porcograsso nor Vannacena say aught thereof.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090038"/><q>Thou wouldst say
 Ippocrasso and Avicenna,</q> returned the Master. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090039"/><q>I'faith I know
 not,</q> quoth Bruno. <q>I as ill know the meaning of your words as
 you of mine. But Gumedra in the speech of the great Can signifies
 the same as Empress in ours. Ah! a fine woman you would find
 her, and plenty of her! I warrant she would make you forget your
 drugs and prescriptions and plasters.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090040"/>And so, Bruno from time to
 time whetting the Master's appetite, and the Master at length thinking
 that by his honourable entreatment of him he had fairly made a
 conquest of Bruno, it befell that one evening, while he held the light
 for Bruno, who was at work on the battle of rats and mice, he
 determined to discover to him his desire; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090041"/>and as they were alone,
 thus he spoke: <q>God knows, Bruno, that there lives not the man,
 for whom I would do as much as for thee: why, if thou wast to bid
 me go all the way from here to <placeName>Peretola</placeName>,<note>About four miles from
 <placeName>Florence</placeName>.</note> I almost think I would do
 so; wherefore I trust thou wilt not deem it strange if I talk to thee
 as an intimate friend and in confidence. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090042"/>Thou knowest 'tis not long
 since thou didst enlarge with me on thy gay company and their
 doings, which has engendered in me such a desire as never was to
 know more thereof. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090043"/>Nor without reason, as thou wilt discover,
 should I ever become a member of the said company, for I straightway
 give thee leave to make game of me, should I not then fetch
 me the fairest maid thou hast seen this many a day, whom I saw
 last year at <placeName>Cacavincigli</placeName>, and to whom I am entirely devoted; and by
 the body of Christ I offered her ten Bolognese groats, that she should
 pleasure me, and she would not. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090044"/>Wherefore I do most earnestly
 entreat thee to instruct me what I must do to fit myself for membership
 in the company; and never doubt that in me you will have a true
 and loyal comrade, and one that will do you honour. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090045"/>And above all
 thou seest how goodly I am of my person, and how well furnished
 with legs, and of face as fresh as a rose; and therewithal I am a
 doctor of medicine, and I scarce think you have any such among
 you; and not a little excellent lore I have, and many a good song by
 heart, of which I will sing thee one;</q> and forthwith he fell a
 singing.</p><pb n="241"/><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090046"/>Bruno had such a mind to laugh, that he could scarce contain
 himself; but still he kept a grave countenance; and, when the
 Master had ended his song, and said: <q>How likes it thee?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090047"/>he answered: <q>Verily, no lyre of straw could vie with you, so
 artargutically<note>In the Italian <q>artagoticamente,</q> a word of
 Boccaccio's own minting.</note> you refine your strain.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090048"/><q>I warrant
 thee,</q> returned the
 Master, <q>thou hadst never believed it, hadst thou not heard me.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090049"/><q>Ay, indeed, sooth sayst thou,</q> quoth Bruno. 
      <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090050"/><q>And I have other
 songs to boot,</q> said the Master; <q>but enough of this at present. Thou
 must know that I, such as thou seest me, am a gentleman's son, albeit
 my father lived in the contado; and on my mother's side I come of
 the <placeName>Vallecchio</placeName> family. And as thou mayst have observed I have
 quite the finest library and wardrobe of all the physicians in <placeName>Florence</placeName>.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090051"/>God's faith! I have a robe that cost, all told, close upon a hundred
 pounds in bagattines<note>A Venetian coin of extremely low value, being
 reckoned as 1/4 of the Florentine quattrino.</note> more than ten years ago.
 Wherefore I make
 most instant suit to thee that thou get me enrolled, which if thou do,
 God's faith! be thou never so ill, thou shalt pay me not a stiver for
 my tendance of thee.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090052"/>Whereupon Bruno, repeating to himself, as
 he had done many a time before, that the doctor was a very numskull:
 <q>Master,</q> quoth he, <q>shew a little more light here, and
 have patience until I have put the finishing touches to the tails of these
 rats, and then I will answer you.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090053"/>So he finished the tails,
 and then, putting on an air as if he were not a little embarrassed by
 the request: <q>Master mine,</q> quoth he, <q>I should have great
 things to expect from you; that I know: but yet what you ask of
 me, albeit to your great mind it seems but a little thing, is a weighty
 matter indeed for me; nor know I a soul in the world, to whom,
 though well able, I would grant such a request, save to you alone:
 and this I say not for friendship's sake alone, albeit I love you as I
 ought, but for that your discourse is so fraught with wisdom, that 'tis
 enough to make a beguine start out of her boots, much more, then, to
 incline me to change my purpose; and the more I have of your
 company, the wiser I repute you. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090054"/>Whereto I may add, that, if for
 no other cause, I should still be well disposed towards you for the
 love I see you bear to that fair piece of flesh of which you spoke but
 now. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090055"/>But this I must tell you: 'tis not in my power to do as you
 <pb n="242"/>would have me in this matter; but, though I cannot myself do the
 needful in your behalf, if you will pledge your faith, whole and solid
 as may be, to keep my secret, I will shew you how to go about it
 for yourself, and I make no doubt that, having this fine library and
 the other matters you spoke of a while ago, you will compass your
 end.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090056"/>Quoth then the Master: <q>Nay, but speak freely; I see
 thou dost yet scarce know me, and how well I can keep a secret.
 There were few things that Messer Guasparruolo da Saliceto did,
 when he was Podestà of Forlinpopoli, that he did not confide to me,
 so safe he knew they would be in my keeping: and wouldst thou
 be satisfied that I say sooth? I assure you I was the first man whom
 he told that he was about to marry <persName>Bergamina</persName>: so there's for thee.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090057"/><q>Well and good,</q> said Bruno, <q>if such as he confided in you, well
 indeed may I do the like. Know, then, that you will have to proceed
 on this wise: Our company is governed by a captain and a
 council of two, who are changed every six months: and on the
 calends without fail Buffalmacco will be captain, and I councillor:
 'tis so fixed: and the captain has not a little power to promote the
 admission and enrolment of whomsoever he will: wherefore, methinks,
 you would do well to make friends with Buffalmacco and
 honourably entreat him: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090058"/>he is one that, marking your great wisdom,
 will take a mighty liking to you forthwith; and when you have just
 a little dazzled him with your wisdom and these fine things of yours,
 you may make your request to him; and he will not know how to
 say no--I have already talked with him of you, and he is as well
 disposed to you as may be--and having so done you will leave the
 rest to me.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090059"/>Whereupon: <q>Thy words are to me for an exceeding
 great joy,</q> quoth the Master: <q>and if he be one that loves to
 converse with sages, he has but to exchange a word or two with
 me, and I will answer for it that he will be ever coming to see me;
 for so fraught with wisdom am I, that I could furnish a whole city
 therewith, and still remain a great sage.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090060"/>Having thus set matters in train, Bruno related the whole affair,
 point by point, to Buffalmacco, to whom it seemed a thousand years
 till he should be able to give Master Noodle that of which he was in
 quest. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090061"/>The doctor, now all agog to go the course, lost no time, and
 found no difficulty, in making friends with Buffalmacco, and fell to
 entertaining him, and Bruno likewise, at breakfast and supper in
 <pb n="243"/>most magnificent style; while they fooled him to the top of his
 bent, for, being gentlemen that appreciated excellent wines and fat
 capons, besides other good cheer in plenty, they were inclined to be
 very neighbourly, and needed no second bidding, but, always letting
 him understand that there was none other whose company they
 relished so much, kept ever with him.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090062"/>However, in due time the Master asked of Buffalmacco that
 which he had before asked of Bruno. Whereat Buffalmacco feigned
 to be not a little agitated, and turning angrily to Bruno, made a
 great pother about his ears, saying: <q>By the Most High God of
 Pasignano I vow I can scarce forbear to give thee that over the head
 that should make they nose fall about thy heels, traitor that thou art,
 for 'tis thou alone that canst have discovered these secrets to the
 Master.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090063"/>Whereupon the Master interposed with no little vigour,
 averring with oaths that 'twas from another source that he had gotten
 his knowledge; and Buffalmacco at length allowed himself to be
 pacified by the sage's words. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090064"/>So turning to him: <q>Master,</q> quoth
 he, <q>'tis evident indeed that you have been at <placeName>Bologna</placeName>, and have
 come back hither with a mouth that blabs not, and that 'twas on no
 pippin, as many a dolt does, but on the good long pumpkin that you
 learned your A B C; and, if I mistake not, you were baptized on a
 Sunday;<note><!--(i)-->I.e.<!--(/i)--> without salt, that Florentine symbol of wit, not
 being so readily procurable on a holiday as on working-days.</note><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090065"/>and
 though Bruno has told me that 'twas medicine you
studied there, 'tis my opinion that you there studied the art of
 catching men, of which, what with your wisdom and your startling
 revelations, you are the greatest master that ever I knew.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090066"/>He
 would have said more, but the doctor, turning to Bruno, broke in
 with: <q>Ah! what it is to consort and converse with the wise!
 Who but this worthy man would thus have read my mind through
 and through? Less quick by far to rate me at my true worth wast
 thou. But what said I when thou toldst me that Buffalmacco
 delighted to converse with sages? Confess now; have I not kept
 my word?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090067"/><q>Verily,</q> quoth Bruno, <q>you have more than kept
 it.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090068"/>Then, addressing Buffalmacco: <q>Ah!</q> cried the Master,
 <q>what hadst thou said, hadst thou seen me at <placeName>Bologna</placeName>, where there
 was none, great or small, doctor or scholar, but was devoted to me,
 so well wist I how to entertain them with my words of wisdom.
 <pb n="244"/><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090069"/>Nay more; let me tell thee that there was never a word I spoke but
 set every one a laughing, so great was the pleasure it gave them.
 And at my departure they all deplored it most bitterly, and would
 have had me remain, and by way of inducement went so far as to
 propose that I should be sole lecturer to all the students in medicine
 that were there; which offer I declined, for that I was minded to
 return hither, having vast estates here, that have ever belonged to
 my family; which, accordingly, I did.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090070"/>Quoth then Bruno to
 Buffalmacco: <q>How shews it, now, man? Thou didst not believe
 me when I told thee what he was. By the Gospels there is never a
 physician in this city that has the lore of ass's urine by heart as he
 has: verily, thou wouldst not find his like between here and the
 gates of <placeName>Paris</placeName>. Now see if thou canst help doing as he would have
 thee.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090071"/><q>'Tis even as Bruno says,</q> observed the doctor, <q>but I am
 not understood here. You Florentines are somewhat slow of wit.
 Would you could see me in my proper element, among a company
 of doctors!</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090072"/>Whereupon: <q>Of a truth, Master,</q> quoth Buffalmacco,
 <q>your lore far exceeds any I should ever have imputed to
 you; wherefore, addressing you as 'tis meet to address a man of your
 wisdom, I give you disjointedly to understand that without fail I will
 procure your enrolment in our company.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090073"/>After this promise the honours lavished by the doctor upon the
 two men grew and multiplied; in return for which they diverted
 themselves by setting him a prancing upon every wildest chimera in
 the world; and promised, among other matters, to give him by way
 of mistress, the Countess of <placeName>Civillari</placeName>,<note>A public sink at
 <placeName>Florence</placeName>.</note>
 whom they averred to be the
 goodliest creature to be found in all the Netherlands of the human
 race; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090074"/>and the doctor asking who this Countess might be: <q>Mature
 my gherkin,</q> quoth Buffalmacco, <q>she is indeed a very great lady,
 and few houses are there in the world in which she has not some
 jurisdiction; nay, the very Friars Minors, to say nought of other
 folk, pay her tribute to the sound of the kettle-drum. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090075"/>And I may
 tell you that, when she goes abroad, she makes her presence very
 sensibly felt, albeit for the most part she keeps herself close: however,
 'tis no great while since she passed by your door one night on
 her way to the <placeName>Arno</placeName> to bathe her feet and get a breath of air; but
 <pb n="245"/>most of her time she abides at Laterina.<note>In the contado of
 <placeName>Arezzo</placeName>:
 the <!--(i)-->équivoque<!--(/i)--> is tolerably obvious.</note><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090076"/>Serjeants has she
 not
 a
 few that go their rounds at short intervals, bearing, one and all, the
 rod and the bucket in token of her sovereignty, and barons in plenty
 in all parts, as Tamagnino della Porta,<note>Slang for an ill-kept
 jakes.</note> Don Meta,<note>Also slang: signifying a pyramidal pile of
 ordure.</note> Manico di Scopa,<note>Broom-handle.</note>
 Squacchera,<note>The meaning of this term may perhaps be divined from the
 sound.</note> and others, with whom I doubt not you are intimately
 acquainted, though you may not just now bear them in mind. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090077"/>Such,
 then, is the great lady, in whose soft arms we, if we delude not ourselves,
 will certainly place you, in which case you may well dispense
 with her of <placeName>Cacavincigli</placeName>.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090078"/>The doctor, who had been born and bred at <placeName>Bologna</placeName>, and understood
 not their words, found the lady quite to his mind; and shortly
 afterwards the painters brought him tidings of his election into the
 company. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090079"/>Then came the day of the nocturnal gathering, and the
 doctor had the two men to breakfast; and when they had breakfasted,
 he asked them after what manner he was to join the company.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090080"/>Whereupon: <q>Lo, now, Master,</q> quoth Buffalmacco, <q>you have
 need of a stout heart; otherwise you may meet with some let, to
 our most grievous hurt; and for what cause you have need of this
 stout heart, you shall hear. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090081"/>You must contrive to be to-night about
 the hour of first sleep on one of the raised tombs that have been
 lately placed outside of <placeName>Santa Maria Novella</placeName>; and mind that you
 wear one of your best gowns, that your first appearance may impress
 the company with a proper sense of your dignity, and also because,
 as we are informed, for we were not present at the time, the
 Countess, by reason that you are a gentleman, is minded to make you
 a Knight of the Bath at her own charges. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090082"/>So you will wait there,
 until one, whom we shall send, come for you: who, that you may
 know exactly what you have to expect, will be a beast black and
 horned, of no great size; and he will go snorting and bounding
 amain about the piazza in front of you, with intent to terrify you;
 but, when he perceives that you are not afraid, he will draw nigh you
 quietly, and when he is close by you, then get you down from the
 <pb n="246"/>tomb, fearing nothing; and, minding you neither of God nor of the
 saints, mount him, and when you are well set on his back, then fold
 your arms upon your breast, as in submission, and touch him no
 more. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090083"/>Then, going gently, he will bear you to us; but once mind
 you of God, or the saints, or give way to fear, and I warn you, he
 might give you a fall, or dash you against something that you would
 find scarce pleasant; wherefore, if your heart misgives you, you were
 best not to come, for you would assuredly do yourself a mischief, and
 us no good at all.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090084"/>Quoth then the doctor: <q>You know me not
 as yet; 'tis perchance because I wear the gloves and the long robe
 that you misdoubt me. Ah! did you but know what feats I have
 done in times past at <placeName>Bologna</placeName>, when I used to go after the women
 with my comrades, you would be lost in amazement. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090085"/>God's faith!
 on one of those nights there was one of them, a poor sickly creature
 she was too, and stood not a cubit in height, who would not come
 with us; so first I treated her to many a good cuff, and then I took
 her up by main force, and carried her well-nigh as far as a cross-bow
 will send a bolt, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090086"/>and so caused her, willy-nilly, come with us. And
 on another occasion I mind me that, having none other with me but
 my servant, a little after the hour of Ave Maria, I passed beside the
 cemetery of the Friars Minors, and, though that very day a woman
 had been there interred, I had no fear at all. So on this score you
 may make your minds easy; for indeed I am a man of exceeding
 great courage and prowess. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090087"/>And to appear before you with due
 dignity, I will don my scarlet gown, in which I took my doctor's
 degree, and it remains to be seen if the company will not give me a
 hearty welcome, and make me captain out of hand. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090088"/>Let me once
 be there, and you will see how things will go; else how is it that
 this countess, that has not yet seen me, is already so enamoured of
 me that she is minded to make me a Knight of the Bath? And
 whether I shall find knighthood agreeable, or know how to support
 the dignity well or ill, leave that to me.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090089"/>Whereupon: <q>Well
 said, excellent well said,</q> quoth Buffalmacco: <q>but look to it you
 disappoint us not, either by not coming or by not being found, when
 we send for you; and this I say, because 'tis cold weather, and you
 medical gentlemen take great care of your health.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090090"/><q>God forbid,</q>
 replied the doctor, <q>I am none of your chilly folk; I fear not the
 cold: 'tis seldom indeed, when I leave my bed a nights, to answer
 <pb n="247"/>the call of nature, as one must at times, that I do more than throw
 a pelisse over my doublet; so rest assured that I shall be there.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090091"/>So they parted; and towards nightfall the Master found a pretext
 for leaving his wife, and privily got out his fine gown, which in due
 time he donned, and so hied him to the tombs, and having perched
 himself on one of them, huddled himself together, for 'twas mighty
 cold, to await the coming of the beast. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090092"/>Meanwhile Buffalmacco,
 who was a tall man and strong, provided himself with one of those
 dominos that were wont to be worn in certain revels which are now
 gone out of fashion; and enveloped in a black pelisse turned inside
 out, shewed like a bear, save that the domino had the face of a devil,
 and was furnished with horns: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090093"/>in which guise, Bruno following
 close behind to see the sport, he hied him to the piazza of Santa
 Maria Novella. And no sooner wist he that the Master was on
 the tomb, than he fell a careering in a most wild and furious manner
 to and fro the piazza, and snorting and bellowing and gibbering like
 one demented, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090094"/>insomuch that, as soon as the Master was ware of him,
 each several hair on his head stood on end, and he fell a trembling
 in every limb, being in sooth more timid than a woman, and wished
 himself safe at home: but as there he was, he strove might and
 main to keep his spirits up, so overmastering was his desire to see the
 marvels of which Bruno and Buffalmacco had told him. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090095"/>However,
 after a while Buffalmacco allowed his fury to abate, and came quietly
 up to the tomb on which the Master was, and stood still. The
 Master, still all of a tremble with fear, could not at first make up his
 mind, whether to get on the beast's back, or no; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090096"/>but at length,
 doubting it might be the worse for him if he did not mount the
 beast, he overcame the one dread by the aid of the other, got down
 from the tomb, saying under his breath: <q>God help me!</q> and
 seated himself very comfortably on the beast's back; and then, still
 quaking in every limb, he folded his arms as he had been bidden.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090097"/>Buffalmacco now started, going on all-fours, at a very slow pace,
 in the direction of <placeName>Santa Maria della Scala</placeName>, and so brought the
 Master within a short distance of the Convent of the Ladies of <placeName>Ripoli</placeName>.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090098"/>Now, in that quarter there were divers trenches, into which the
 husbandmen of those parts were wont to discharge the Countess of
 <placeName>Civillari</placeName>, that she might afterwards serve them to manure their land.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090099"/>Of one of which trenches, as he came by, Buffalmacco skirted the
 <pb n="248"/>edge, and seizing his opportunity, raised a hand, and caught the
 doctor by one of his feet, and threw him off his back and head-foremost
 right into the trench, and then, making a terrific noise and
 frantic gestures as before, went bounding off by Santa Maria della
 Scala towards the field of Ognissanti, where he found Bruno, who
 had betaken him thither that he might laugh at his ease; and there
 the two men in high glee took their stand to observe from a distance
 how the bemired doctor would behave. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090100"/>Finding himself in so loathsome
 a place, the Master struggled might and main to raise himself
 and get out; and though again and again he slipped back, and
 swallowed some drams of the ordure, yet, bemired from head to foot,
 woebegone and crestfallen, he did at last get out, leaving his hood
 behind him. Then, removing as much of the filth as he might with
 his hands, knowing not what else to do, he got him home, where,
 by dint of much knocking, he at last gained admittance; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090101"/>and scarce
 was the door closed behind the malodorous Master, when Bruno and
 Buffalmacco were at it, all agog to hear after what manner he would

 him the soundest rating that ever bad husband got. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090102"/><q>Ah!</q> quoth
 she, <q>fine doings, these! Thou hast been with some other woman,
 and wast minded to make a brave shew in thy scarlet gown. So I
 was not enough for thee! not enough for thee forsooth, I that might
 content a crowd! Would they had choked thee with the filth in
 which they have soused thee; 'twas thy fit resting-place. Now, to
 think that a physician of repute, and a married man, should go by
 night after strange women!</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090103"/>Thus, and with much more to the
 like effect, while the doctor was busy washing himself, she ceased
 not to torment him until midnight.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090104"/>On the morrow, Bruno and Buffalmacco, having painted their
 bodies all over with livid patches to give them the appearance of
 having been thrashed, came to the doctor's house, and finding that
 he was already risen, went in, being saluted on all hands by a foul
 smell, for time had not yet served thoroughly to cleanse the house.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090105"/>The doctor, being informed that they were come to see him,
 advanced to meet them, and bade them good morning. Whereto
 Bruno and Buffalmacco, having prepared their answer, replied:
 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090106"/><q>No good morning shall you have from us: rather we pray God to
 give you bad years enough to make an end of you, seeing that there
 <pb n="249"/>lives no more arrant and faithless traitor. 'Tis no fault of yours, if
 we, that did our best to honour and pleasure you, have not come by
 a dog's death; 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090107"/>your faithlessness has cost us to-night as many sound
 blows as would more than suffice to keep an ass a trotting all the
 way from here to <placeName>Rome</placeName>; besides which, we have been in peril of
 expulsion from the company in which we arranged for your enrolment.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090108"/>If you doubt our words, look but at our bodies, what a state
 they are in.</q> And so, baring their breasts they gave him a glimpse
 of the patches they had painted there, and forthwith covered them
 up again. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090109"/>The doctor would have made them his excuses, and
 recounted his misfortunes, and how he had been thrown into the
 trench. But Buffalmacco broke in with: <q>Would he had thrown
 you from the bridge into the <placeName>Arno</placeName>! Why must you needs mind
 you of God and the saints? Did we not forewarn you?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090110"/><q>God's
 faith,</q> returned the doctor, <q>that did I not.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090111"/><q>How?</q> quoth
 Buffalmacco, <q>you did not? You do so above a little; for he that
 we sent for you told us that you trembled like an aspen, and knew not
 where you were. You have played us a sorry trick; but never
 another shall do so; and as for you, we will give you such requital
 thereof as you deserve.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08090112"/>The doctor now began to crave their
 pardon, and to implore them for God's sake not to expose him to
 shame, and used all the eloquence at his command to make his peace
 with them. And if he had honourably entreated them before, he
 thenceforth, for fear they should publish his disgrace, did so much
 more abundantly, and courted them both by entertaining them at his
 table and in other ways. And so you have heard how wisdom is
 imparted to those that get it not at <placeName>Bologna</placeName>.</p></div><pb n="250"/><div type="novella" corresp="nov0810"><head>Novel X</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100001"/><!--(i)-->A Sicilian woman cunningly conveys from a merchant that

 countries that have ports, that all merchants arriving there with
 merchandise, should, on discharging, bring all their goods into a
 warehouse, called in many places <q>dogana,</q> and maintained by
 the state, or the lord of the land; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100005"/>where those that are assigned
 to that office allot to each merchant, on receipt of an invoice of
 all his goods and the value thereof, a room in which he stores
 his goods under lock and key; whereupon the said officers of the
 dogana enter all the merchant's goods to his credit in the book
 of the dogana, and afterwards make him pay duty thereon, or on
 such part as he withdraws from the warehouse. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100006"/>By which book of

 of the merchandise that is there, and also who are the owners
 thereof, with whom, as occasion serves, they afterwards treat of
 exchanges, barters, sales and other modes of disposing of the goods.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100007"/>Which custom obtained, as in many other places, so also at <placeName>Palermo</placeName>
 in <placeName>Sicily</placeName>, where in like manner there were and are not a few women,
 fair as fair can be, but foes to virtue, who by whoso knows them not
 would be reputed great and most virtuous ladies. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100008"/>And being given
 not merely to fleece but utterly to flay men, they no sooner espy a
 foreign merchant in the city, than they find out from the book of
 the dogana how much he has there and what he is good for; and
 then by caressing and amorous looks and gestures, and words of
 honeyed sweetness, they strive to entice and allure the merchant to
 their love, and not seldom have they succeeded, and wrested from
 him great part or the whole of his merchandise; and of some they
 have gotten goods and ship and flesh and bones, so delightsomely
 have they known how to ply the shears.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100009"/>Now 'tis not long since one of our young Florentines, Niccolò da
 Cignano by name, albeit he was called Salabaetto, arrived there,
 being sent by his masters with all the woollen stuffs that he had not
 been able to dispose of at <placeName>Salerno</placeName> fair, which might perhaps be
 worth five hundred florins of gold; and having given the invoice to
 the officers of the dogana and stored the goods, Salabaetto was in no
 hurry to get them out of bond, but took a stroll or two about the
 city for his diversion. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100010"/>And as he was fresh-complexioned and fair
 and not a little debonair, it so befell that one of these ladies that
 plied the shears, and called herself Jancofiore, began to ogle him.
 Whereof he taking note, and deeming that she was a great lady,
 supposed that she was taken by his good looks, and cast about how
 he might manage this amour with all due discretion; wherefore,
 saying nought to a soul, he began to pass to and fro before her house.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100011"/>Which she observing, occupied herself for a few days in inflaming
 his passion, and then affecting to be dying of love for him, sent
 privily to him a woman that she had in her service, and who was an
 adept in the arts of the procuress. She, after not a little palaver,
 told him, while the tears all but stood in her eyes, that for his handsome
 person and winsome air her mistress was so enamoured of him,
 that she found no peace by day or by night; and therefore, if 'twere
 <pb n="252"/>agreeable to him, there was nought she desired so much as to meet
 him privily at a bagnio: whereupon she drew a ring from her purse,
 and gave it him by way of token from her mistress. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100012"/>Overjoyed as
 ne'er another to hear such good news, Salabaetto took the ring, and,
 after drawing it across his eyes and kissing it, put it on his finger,
 and told the good woman that, if Madonna Jancofiore loved him,
 she was well requited, for that he loved her more dearly than himself,
 and that he was ready to meet her wherever and whenever she might
 see fit. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100013"/>With which answer the procuress hied her back to her
 mistress, and shortly afterwards Salabaetto was informed that he was
 to meet the lady at a certain bagnio at vespers of the ensuing day.</p><p>So, saying nought to a soul of the matter, he hied him punctually
 at the appointed hour to the bagnio, and found that it had been taken
 by the lady; <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100014"/>nor had he long to wait before two female slaves made
 their appearance, bearing on their heads, the one a great and goodly
 mattress of wadding, and the other a huge and well-filled basket; and
 having laid the mattress on a bedstead in one of the rooms of the bagnio,
 they covered it with a pair of sheets of the finest fabric, bordered with
 silk, and a quilt of the whitest <placeName>Cyprus</placeName> buckram, with two
 daintily-embroidered
 pillows. The slaves then undressed and got into the
 bath, which they thoroughly washed and scrubbed: <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100015"/>whither soon
 afterwards the lady, attended by other two female slaves, came,
 and made haste to greet Salabaetto with the heartiest of cheer; and
 when, after heaving many a mighty sigh, she had embraced and
 kissed him: <q>I know not,</q> quoth she, <q>who but thou could have
 brought me to this, such a fire hast thou kindled in my soul, little
 dog of a Tuscan!</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100016"/>Whereupon she was pleased that they should
 undress, and get into the bath, and two of the slaves with them;
 which, accordingly, they did; and she herself, suffering none other to
 lay a hand upon him, did with wondrous care wash Salabaetto from
 head to foot with soap perfumed with musk and cloves; after which
 she let the slaves wash and shampoo herself. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100017"/>The slaves then
 brought two spotless sheets of finest texture, which emitted such a
 scent of roses, that 'twas as if there was nought there but roses, in
 one of which having wrapped Salabaetto, and in the other the lady,
 they bore them both to bed, where, the sheets in which they were
 enfolded being withdrawn by the slaves as soon as they had done
 sweating, they remained stark naked in the others. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100018"/>The slaves then
 <pb n="253"/>took from the basket cruets of silver most goodly, and full, this of
 rose-water, that of water of orange-blossom, a third of water of
 jasmine-blossom, and a fourth of nanfa<note>Neither the <!--(i)-->Vocab. degli
 Accad. della Crusca<!--(/i)--> nor the <!--(i)-->Riccbezze<!--(/i)--> attempts

 sprinkled them: after which, boxes of comfits and the finest wines
 being brought forth, they regaled them a while. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100019"/>To Salabaetto 'twas
 as if he were in Paradise; a thousand times he scanned the lady,
 who was indeed most beautiful; and he counted each hour as
 a hundred years until the slaves should get them gone, and he find
 himself in the lady's arms.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100020"/>At length, by the lady's command, the slaves departed, leaving a
 lighted torch in the room, and then the lady and Salabaetto embraced,
 and to Salabaetto's prodigious delight, for it seemed to him that she
 was all but dissolved for love of him, tarried there a good while.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100021"/>However, the time came when the lady must needs rise: so she
 called the slaves, with whose help they dressed, regaled them again
 for a while with wine and comfits, and washed their faces and hands
 with the odoriferous waters. Then as they were going, quoth the
 lady to Salabaetto: <q>If it be agreeable to thee, I should deem it a
 very great favour if thou wouldst come to-night to sup and sleep
 with me.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100022"/>Salabaetto, who, captivated by her beauty and her
 studied graciousness, never doubted but he was dear to her as her
 very heart, made answer: <q>Madam, there is nought you can
 desire but is in the last degree agreeable to me; wherefore to-night
 and ever 'tis my purpose to do whatsoever you may be pleased to
 command.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100023"/>So home the lady hied her, and having caused a brave
 shew to be made in her chamber with her dresses and other paraphernalia,
 and a grand supper to be prepared, awaited Salabaetto;
 who, being come there as soon as 'twas dark, had of her a gladsome
 welcome, and was regaled with an excellent and well-served supper.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100024"/>After which, they repaired to the chamber, where he was saluted by
 a wondrous sweet odour of aloe-wood, and observed that the bed
 was profusely furnished with birds,<note><!--(i)-->I. e.<!--(/i)--> with a sort of
 musical
 boxes in the shape of birds.</note> after the fashion of <placeName>Cyprus</placeName>, and
 that not a few fine dresses were hanging upon the pegs. Which
 circumstances did, one and all, beget in him the belief that this must
 <pb n="254"/>be a great and wealthy lady; and, though he had heard a hint or
 two to the contrary touching her life, he would by no means credit
 them; nor, supposing that she had perchance taken another with
 guile, would he believe that the same thing might befall him. So to
 his exceeding great solace, he lay with her that night, and ever grew
 more afire for her. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100025"/>On the morrow, as she was investing him with
 a fair and dainty girdle of silver, with a goodly purse attached:
 <q>Sweet my Salabaetto,</q> quoth she, <q>prithee forget me not; even
 as my person, so is all that I have at thy pleasure, and all that
 I can at thy command.</q></p><p>Salabaetto then embraced and kissed her, and so bade her adieu,
 and betook him to the place where the merchants were wont to congregate.
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100026"/>And so it befell that he, continuing to consort with her
 from time to time, and being never a denier the poorer thereby,
 disposed of his merchandise for ready money and at no small profit;
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100027"/>whereof not by him but by another the lady was forthwith advised.
 And Salabaetto being come to see her one evening, she greeted him
 gaily and gamesomely, and fell a kissing and hugging him, and made
 as if she were so afire for love of him that she was like to die thereof
 in his arms; and offered to give him two most goodly silver cups
 that she had, which Salabaetto would not accept, having already had
 from her (taking one time with another) fully thirty florins of gold,
 while he had not been able to induce her to touch so much as a groat
 of his money. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100028"/>But when by this shew of passion and generosity
 she had thoroughly kindled his flame, in came, as she had arranged,
 one of her slaves, and spoke to her; whereupon out of the room she
 went, and after a while came back in tears, and threw herself prone
 on the bed, and set up the most dolorous lamentation that ever
 woman made. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100029"/>Whereat Salabaetto wondering, took her in his arms,
 and mingled his tears with hers, and said: <q>Alas! heart of my
 body! what ails thee thus of a sudden? Wherefore art thou so
 distressed? Ah! tell me the reason, my soul.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100030"/>The lady allowed
 him to run on in this strain for a good while, and then: <q>Alas!
 sweet my lord,</q> quoth she, 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100031"/><q>I know not either what to do or what
 to say. I have but now received a letter from <placeName>Messina</placeName>, in which my
 brother bids me sell, if need be, all that I have here, and send him
 without fail within eight days a thousand florins of gold: otherwise
 he will forfeit his head. I know not how to come by them so soon:
 <pb n="255"/>had I but fifteen days, I would make a shift to raise them in a quarter
 where I might raise a much larger sum, or I would sell one of our
 estates; but, as this may not be, would I had been dead or e'er this
 bad news had reached me!</q> Which said, affecting to be utterly
 broken-hearted, she ceased not to weep.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100032"/>Salabaetto, the ardour of whose passion had in great measure
 deprived him of the sagacity which the circumstances demanded,
 supposed that the tears were genuine enough, and the words even
 more so. Wherefore: <q>Madam,</q> quoth he, <q>I could not furnish
 you with a thousand, but if five hundred florins of gold would suffice,
 they are at your service, if you think you could repay them within
 fifteen days; and you may deem yourself in luck's way, for 'twas
 only yesterday that I sold my woollens, which had I not done, I
 could not have lent you a groat.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100033"/><q>Alas!</q> returned the lady,
 <q>then thou hast been in straits for money? Oh! why didst thou
 not apply to me? Though I have not a thousand at my command,
 I could have given thee quite a hundred, nay indeed two hundred
 florins. By what thou hast said thou hast made me hesitate to accept
 the service that thou proposest to render me.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100034"/>Which words fairly
 delivered Salabaetto into the lady's hands, insomuch that: <q>Madam,</q>
 quoth he, <q>I would not have you decline my help for such a scruple;
 for had my need been as great as yours, I should certainly have
 applied to you.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100035"/>Quoth then the lady: <q>Ah! Salabaetto mine,
 well I wot that the love thou bearest me is a true and perfect love,
 seeing that, without waiting to be asked, thou dost so handsomely
 come to my aid with so large a sum of money. And albeit I was
 thine without this token of thy love, yet, assuredly, it has made me
 thine in an even greater degree; nor shall I ever forget that 'tis to
 thee I owe my brother's life. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100036"/>But God knows I take thy money
 from thee reluctantly, seeing that thou art a merchant, and 'tis by
 means of money that merchants conduct all their affairs; but, as
 necessity constrains me, and I have good hope of speedily repaying
 thee, I will even take it, and by way of security, if I should find no
 readier method, I will pawn all that I have here.</q> Which said, she
 burst into tears, and fell upon Salabaetto, pressing her cheek upon
 his.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100037"/>Salabaetto tried to comfort her; and having spent the night with
 her, on the morrow, being minded to shew himself her most devoted
 <pb n="256"/>servant, brought her, without awaiting any reminder, five hundred
 fine florins of gold: which she, laughing at heart while the tears
 streamed from her eyes, took, Salabaetto trusting her mere promise
 of repayment. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100038"/>Now that the lady had gotten the money, the
 complexion of affairs began to alter; and whereas Salabaetto had
 been wont to have free access to her, whenever he was so minded,
 now for one reason or another he was denied admittance six times
 out of seven; nor did she greet him with the same smile, or shower
 on him the same caresses, or do him the same cheer as of yore. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100039"/>So
 a month, two months, passed beyond the time when he was to have
 been repaid his money; and when he demanded it, he was put off
 with words. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100040"/>Whereby Salabaetto, being now ware of the cheat
 which his slender wit had suffered the evil-disposed woman to put
 upon him, and also that, having neither writing nor witness against
 her, he was entirely at her mercy in regard of his claim, and being,
 moreover, ashamed to lodge any complaint with any one, as well
 because he had been forewarned of her character, as because he
 dreaded the ridicule to which his folly justly exposed him, was
 chagrined beyond measure, and inly bewailed his simplicity. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100041"/>And
 his masters having written to him, bidding him change the money
 and remit it to them, he, being apprehensive that, making default as
 he must, he should, if he remained there, be detected, resolved to
 depart; and having taken ship, he repaired, not, as he should have
 done, to <placeName>Pisa</placeName>, but to <placeName>Naples</placeName>; 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100042"/>where at that time resided our gossip,
 Pietro dello Canigiano, treasurer of the Empress of <placeName>Constantinople</placeName>,
 a man of great sagacity and acuteness, and a very great friend of
 Salabaetto and his kinsfolk; to whom trusting in his great discretion,
 Salabaetto after a while discovered his distress, telling him what he
 had done, and the sorry plight in which by consequence he stood,
 and craving his aid and counsel, that he might the more readily find
 means of livelihood there, for that he was minded never to go back
 to <placeName>Florence</placeName>. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100043"/>Impatient to hear of such folly: <q>'Twas ill done of
 thee,</q> quoth Canigiano, <q>thou hast misbehaved thyself, wronged thy
 masters, and squandered an exorbitant sum in lewdness; however,
 'tis done, and we must consider of the remedy.</q> And indeed, like
 the shrewd man that he was, he had already bethought him what
 was best to be done; and forthwith he imparted it to Salabaetto.
 Which expedient Salabaetto approving, resolved to make the adven<pb n="257"/>ture;
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100044"/>and having still a little money, and being furnished with a loan
 by Canigiano, he provided himself with not a few bales well and
 closely corded, and bought some twenty oil-casks, which he filled,
 and having put all on shipboard, returned to <placeName>Palermo</placeName>. There he
 gave the invoice of the bales, as also of the oil-casks, to the officers of
 the dogana, and having them all entered to his credit, laid them up
 in the store-rooms, saying that he purposed to leave them there until
 the arrival of other merchandise that he expected.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100045"/>Which Jancofiore learning, and being informed that the merchandise,
 that he had brought with him, was worth fully two thousand
 florins of gold, or even more, besides that which he expected, which
 was valued at more than three thousand florins of gold, bethought her
 that she had not aimed high enough, and that 'twere well to refund
 him the five hundred, if so she might make the greater part of the
 five thousand florins her own. Wherefore she sent for him, 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100046"/>and
 Salabaetto, having learned his lesson of cunning, waited on her.
 Feigning to know nought of the cargo he had brought with him, she
 received him with marvellous cheer, and began: <q>Lo, now, if thou
 wast angry with me because I did not repay thee thy money in due
 time:</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100047"/>but Salabaetto interrupted her, saying with a laugh:
 <q>Madam, 'tis true I was a little vexed, seeing that I would have
 plucked out my heart to pleasure you; but listen, and you shall learn
 the quality of my displeasure. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100048"/>Such and so great is the love I bear
 you, that I have sold the best part of all that I possess, whereby I
 have already in this port merchandise to the value of more than two
 thousand florins, and expect from the Levant other goods to the
 value of above three thousand florins, and mean to set up a warehouse
 in this city, and live here, to be ever near you, for that I deem myself
 more blessed in your love than any other lover that lives.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100049"/>Whereupon:
 <q>Harkye, Salabaetto,</q> quoth the lady, <q>whatever advantages
 thee is mighty grateful to me, seeing that I love thee more
 than my very life, and right glad am I that thou art come back with
 intent to stay, for I hope to have many a good time with thee; but
 something I must say to thee by way of excuse, for that, whilst thou
 wast thinking of taking thy departure, there were times when thou
 wast disappointed of seeing me, and others when thou hadst not as
 gladsome a welcome as thou wast wont to have, and therewithal I
 kept not the time promised for the repayment of thy money. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100050"/>Thou
 <pb n="258"/>must know that I was then in exceeding great trouble and tribulation,
 and whoso is thus bested, love he another never so much, cannot
 greet him with as gladsome a mien, or be as attentive to him, as he
 had life; 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100051"/>and thou must further know that 'tis by no means an easy
 matter for a lady to come by a thousand florins of gold: why, 'tis
 every day a fresh lie, and never a promise kept; and so we in our
 turn must needs lie to others; and 'twas for this cause, and not for
 any fault of mine, that I did not repay thee thy money; 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100052"/>however, I
 had it but a little while after thy departure, and had I known whither
 to send it, be sure I would have remitted it to thee; but, as that I
 wist not, I have kept it safe for thee.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100053"/>She then produced a purse, in
 which were the very same coins that he had brought her, and placed
 it in his hand, saying: <q>Count and see if there are five hundred
 there.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100054"/>'Twas the happiest moment Salabaetto had yet known, as,
 having told them out, and found the sum exact, he made answer:
 <q>Madam, I know that you say sooth, and what you have done
 abundantly proves it; wherefore, and for the love I bear you, I
 warrant you there is no sum you might ask of me on any occasion of
 need, with which, if 'twere in my power, I would not accommodate
 you; whereof, when I am settled here, you will be able to assure
 yourself.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100055"/>Having thus in words reinstated himself as her lover, he proceeded
 to treat her as his mistress, whereto she responded, doing all that was
 in her power to pleasure and honour him, and feigning to be in the
 last degree enamoured of him. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100056"/>But Salabaetto, being minded to
 requite her guile with his own, went to her one evening, being bidden
 to sup and sleep with her, with an aspect so melancholy and dolorous,
 that he shewed as he had lief give up the ghost. Jancofiore, as she
 embraced and kissed him, demanded of him the occasion of his
 melancholy. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100057"/>Whereto he, having let her be instant with him a
 good while, made answer: <q>I am undone, for that the ship, having
 aboard her the goods that I expected, has been taken by the corsairs
 of <placeName>Monaco</placeName>, and held to ransom in ten thousand florins of gold, of
 which it falls to me to pay one thousand, and I have not a denier, for
 the five hundred thou repaidst me I sent forthwith to <placeName>Naples</placeName> to buy

 as 'tis not now the right time to sell, I should scarce get half the

 <pb n="259"/>help me at this juncture, and so what to do or what to say I know
 not; but this I know that, if I send not the money without delay,
 my merchandise will be taken to <placeName>Monaco</placeName>, and I shall never touch
 aught of it again.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100059"/>Whereat the lady was mightily annoyed, being
 apprehensive of losing all, and bethought her how she might prevent
 the goods going to <placeName>Monaco</placeName>: wherefore: <q>God knows,</q> quoth
 she, <q>that for the love I bear thee I am not a little sorry for thee:
 but what boots it idly to distress oneself? Had I the money, God
 knows I would lend it thee forthwith, but I have it not. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100060"/>One,
 indeed, there is that accommodated me a day or two ago with five
 hundred florins that I stood in need of, but he requires a heavy
 usance, not less than thirty on the hundred, and if thou shouldst
 have recourse to him, good security must be forthcoming. Now for
 my part I am ready, so I may serve thee, to pledge all these dresses,
 and my person to boot, for as much as he will lend thee thereon; but
 how wilt thou secure the balance?</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100061"/>Salabaetto divined the motive that prompted her thus to accommodate
 him, and that she was to lend the money herself; which suiting
 his purpose well, he first of all thanked her, and then said that, being
 constrained by necessity, he would not stand out against exorbitant
 terms, <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100062"/>adding that, as to the balance, he would secure it upon the
 merchandise that he had at the dogana by causing it to be entered in
 the name of the lender; but that he must keep the key of the storerooms,
 as well that he might be able to shew the goods, if requested,
 as to make sure that none of them should be tampered with or
 changed or exchanged. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100063"/>The lady said that this was reasonable, and
 that 'twas excellent security. So, betimes on the morrow, the lady
 sent for a broker, in whom she reposed much trust, and having talked
 the matter over with him, gave him a thousand florins of gold, which
 the broker took to Salabaetto, and thereupon had all that Salabaetto
 had at the dogana entered in his name; they then had the script and
 counterscript made out, and, the arrangement thus concluded, went
 about their respective affairs. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100064"/>Salabaetto lost no time in getting
 aboard a bark with his five hundred florins of gold, and being come
 to <placeName>Naples</placeName>, sent thence a remittance which fully discharged his obligation
 to his masters that had entrusted him with the stuffs: he also
 paid all that he owed to Pietro dello Canigiano and all his other
 creditors, and made not a little merry with Canigiano over the trick
 <pb n="260"/>he had played the Sicilian lady. He then departed from <placeName>Naples</placeName>, and
 being minded to have done with mercantile affairs, betook him to
 <placeName>Ferrara</placeName>.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100065"/>Jancofiore, surprised at first by Salabaetto's disappearance from
 <placeName>Palermo</placeName>, waxed after a while suspicious; and, when she had waited
 fully two months, seeing that he did not return, she caused the broker
 to break open the store-rooms. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100066"/>And trying first of all the casks, she
 found them full of sea-water, save that in each there was perhaps a
 hog's-head of oil floating on the surface. Then undoing the bales,
 she found them all, save two that contained stuffs, full of tow, and
 in short their whole contents put together were not worth more than
 two hundred florins. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08100067"/>Wherefore Jancofiore, knowing herself to
 have been outdone, regretted long and bitterly the five hundred
 florins of gold that she had refunded, and still more the thousand that
 she had lent, repeating many a time to herself: Who with a Tuscan
 has to do, Had need of eyesight quick and true. Thus, left with the
 loss and the laugh against her, she discovered that there were others
 as knowing as she.</p></div><!--***********************************Conclusion********************************--><div type="conclusion" corresp="d08conclu"><head>Conclusion</head><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08970001"/>No sooner was <persName>Dioneo</persName>'s story ended, than <persName>Lauretta</persName>, witting

 her face and before the company for that which ladies are wont to
 covet the most, <persName>Emilia</persName> was a little shamefast; a tint like that of the
 newly-blown rose overspread her face, and a while she stood silent
 with downcast eyes: then, as the blush faded away, she raised them;
 and having given her seneschal her commands touching all matters
 pertaining to the company, thus she spake:

<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08970004"/>nor can we fail to observe that gardens luxuriant with

<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08970005"/>And therefore I am minded that to-morrow
 the sweet tenor of your discourse be not confined to any particular

 said, she dismissed all the company until supper-time.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08970007"/>All approved the wisdom of what the queen had said; and being
 risen betook them to their several diversions, the ladies to weave
 garlands and otherwise disport them, the young men to play and sing;
 and so they whiled away the hours until supper-time; which being
 come, they gathered about the fair fountain, and took their meal with
 gay and festal cheer. Supper ended, they addressed them to their
 wonted pastime of song and dance. 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p08970008"/>At the close of which the queen,
 notwithstanding the songs which divers of the company had already
 gladly accorded them, called for another from Pamfilo, who without

 in full chorus; nor was there any but gave to its words an inordinate
 degree of attention, endeavóuring by conjecture to penetrate that
 which he intimated that 'twas meet he should keep secret. Divers
 were the interpretations hazarded, but all were wide of the mark.
 At length, however, the queen, seeing that ladies and men alike were
 fain of rest, bade all betake them to bed.</p></div></div><div type="Day" corresp="day09"><pb n="263"/><head>Ninth Day</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09990001"/><!--(i)-->Endeth here the eighth day of the Decameron, beginneth

 the rest of the company following, they hied them to a copse at no

 most beauteous widow lady, of whom it so befell that two of our
 citizens, the one Rinuccio Palermini, the other Alessandro Chiarmontesi,
 by name, tarrying at <placeName>Pistoia</placeName>, for that they were banished
 from <placeName>Florence</placeName>, became, neither witting how it stood with the other,
 in the last degree enamoured.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09010006"/>Wherefore each used all his arts
 <pb n="266"/>to win the love of Madonna <placeName>France</placeName>sca de' Lazzari--such was the
 lady's name--and she, being thus continually plied with ambassages
 and entreaties on the part of both, and having indiscreetly lent ear
 to them from time to time, found it no easy matter discreetly to
 extricate herself, when she was minded to be rid of their pestering,
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09010007"/>until it occurred to her to adopt the following expedient, to wit,
 to require of each a service, such as, though not impracticable,
 she deemed none would actually perform, to the end that, they
 making default, she might have a decent and colourable pretext
 for refusing any longer to receive their ambassages. Which expedient
 was on this wise.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09010008"/>One day there died in <placeName>Pistoia</placeName>, and was
 buried in a tomb outside the church of the Friars Minors, a man,
 who, though his forbears had been gentlefolk, was reputed the very
 worst man, not in <placeName>Pistoia</placeName> only, but in all the world,  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09010009"/>and therewithal
 he was of form and feature so preternaturally hideous that
 whoso knew him not could scarce see him for the first time without
 a shudder. Now, the lady pondering her design on the day of this
 man's death, it occurred to her that he might in a measure subserve
 its accomplishment:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09010010"/>wherefore she said to her maid: <q>Thou
 knowest to what worry and annoyance I am daily put by the
 ambassages of these two Florentines, Rinuccio and Alessandro.
 Now I am not disposed to gratify either of them with my love, and
 therefore, to shake them off, I am minded, as they make such great
 protestations, to put them to the proof by requiring of each something
 which I am sure he will not perform, and thus to rid myself
 of their pestering:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09010011"/>so list what I mean to do. Thou knowest that
 this morning there was interred in the ground of the Friars Minors
 this Scannadio (such was the name of the bad man of whom we
 spoke but now) whose aspect, while he yet lived, appalled even the
 bravest among us.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09010012"/>Thou wilt therefore go privily to Alessandro,
 and say to him: 'Madonna <placeName>France</placeName>sca sends thee word by me that
 the time is now come when thou mayst win that which thou hast
 so much desired, to wit, her love and joyance thereof, if thou be so
 minded, on the following terms.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09010013"/>For a reason, which thou shalt
 learn hereafter, one of her kinsmen is to bring home to her to-night
 the corpse of Scannadio, who was buried this morning; and she,
 standing in mortal dread of this dead man, would fain not see him;
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09010014"/>wherefore she prays thee to do her a great service, and be so good as
 <pb n="267"/>to get thee this evening at the hour of first sleep to the tomb wherein
 Scannadio is buried, and go in, and having wrapped thyself in his
 grave-clothes, lie there, as thou wert Scannadio himself, until one
 come for thee, when thou must say never a word, but let him carry
 thee forth, and bear thee to Madonna <placeName>France</placeName>sca's house, where she
 will give thee welcome, and let thee stay with her, until thou art
 minded to depart, and, for the rest, thou wilt leave it to her.'  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09010015"/>And
 if he says that he will gladly do so, well and good; if not, then thou
 wilt tell him from me, never more to shew himself where I am,
 and, as he values his life, to have a care to send me no more ambassages.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09010016"/>Which done, thou wilt go to Rinuccio Palermini, and
 wilt say to him: 'Madonna <placeName>France</placeName>sca lets thee know that she is
 ready in all respects to comply with thy wishes, so thou wilt do her
 a great service, which is on this wise: to-night, about midnight,
 thou must go to the tomb wherein was this morning interred

 the men, and received from each the same answer, to wit, that to
 pleasure the lady, he would adventure a journey to hell, to say
 nothing of entering a tomb. With which answer the maid returned
 to the lady, who waited to see if they would be such fools as to make
 it good.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09010019"/>Night came, and at the hour of first sleep Alessandro
 Chiarmontesi, stripped to his doublet, quitted his house, and bent his
 steps towards Scannadio's tomb, with intent there to take the dead
 man's place. As he walked, there came upon him a great fear,  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09010020"/>and
 he fell a saying to himself: Ah! what a fool am I! Whither go
 I? How know I that her kinsmen, having detected my love, and
 surmising that which is not, have not put her upon requiring this of
 me, in order that they may slay me in the tomb? In which event I
 alone should be the loser, for nought would ever be heard of it, so
 that they would escape scot-free. Or how know I but that 'tis
 some machination of one of my ill-wishers, whom perchance she
 loves, and is therefore minded to abet?  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09010021"/>And again quoth he to
 <pb n="268"/>himself: But allowing that 'tis neither the one nor the other, and
 that her kinsmen are really to carry me to her house, I scarce believe
 that 'tis either that they would fain embrace Scannadio's corpse themselves,
 or let her do so: rather it must be that they have a mind to
 perpetrate some outrage upon it, for that, perchance, he once did
 them an evil turn.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09010022"/>She bids me say never a word, no matter what
 I may hear or be otherwise ware of. Suppose they were to pluck
 out my eyes, or my teeth, or cut off my hands, or treat me to some
 other horse-play of the like sort, how then? how could I keep
 quiet?  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09010023"/>And if I open my mouth, they will either recognize me,
 and perchance do me a mischief, or, if they spare me, I shall have
 been at pains for nought, for they will not leave me with the lady,
 and she will say that I disobeyed her command, and I shall never
 have aught of her favours.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09010024"/>As thus he communed with himself, he was on the point of
 turning back; but his overmastering love plied him with opposing
 arguments of such force that he kept on his way, and reached
 the tomb; which having opened, he entered, and after stripping
 Scannadio, and wrapping himself in the grave-clothes, closed it, and
 laid himself down in Scannadio's place. He then fell a thinking of the
 dead man, and his manner of life, and the things which he had heard
 tell of as happening by night, and in other less appalling places than
 the houses of the dead;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09010025"/>whereby all the hairs of his head stood on end,
 and he momently expected Scannadio to rise and cut his throat.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09010026"/>However, the ardour of his love so fortified him that he overcame
 these and all other timorous apprehensions, and lay as if he were
 dead, awaiting what should betide him.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09010027"/>Towards midnight Rinuccio, bent likewise upon fulfilling his
 lady's behest, sallied forth of his house, revolving as he went divers
 forebodings of possible contingencies, as that, having Scannadio's
 corpse upon his shoulders, he might fall into the hands of the Signory,
 and be condemned to the fire as a wizard, or that, should the affair
 get wind, it might embroil him with his kinsfolk, or the like, which
 gave him pause.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09010028"/>But then with a revulsion of feeling: Shall I,
 quoth he to himself, deny this lady, whom I so much have loved and
 love, the very first thing that she asks of me? And that too when
 I am thereby to win her favour? No, though 'twere as much as my
 life is worth, far be it from me to fail of keeping my word. So on
 <pb n="269"/>he fared, and arrived at the tomb, which he had no difficulty in
 opening, and being entered, laid hold of  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09010029"/>Alessandro, who, though
 in mortal fear, had given no sign of life, by the feet, and dragged
 him forth, and having hoisted him on to his shoulders, bent his steps
 towards the lady's house. And as he went, being none too careful
 of Alessandro, he swung him from time to time against one or other
 of the angles of certain benches that were by the wayside; and
 indeed the night was so dark and murky that he could not see where
 he was going.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09010030"/>And when he was all but on the threshold of the
 lady's house (she standing within at a window with her maid, to mark
 if Rinuccio would bring Alessandro, and being already provided with
 an excuse for sending them both away), it so befell that the patrol of
 the Signory, who were posted in the street in dead silence, being on
 the look-out for a certain bandit, hearing the tramp of Rinuccio's
 feet, suddenly shewed a light, the better to know what was toward,
 and whither to go, and advancing targes and lances,  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09010031"/>cried out:
 <q>Who goes there?</q> Whereupon Rinuccio, having little leisure
 for deliberation, let Alessandro fall, and took to flight as fast as his
 legs might carry him. Alessandro, albeit encumbered by the graveclothes,
 which were very long, also jumped up and made off.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09010032"/>By
 the light shewn by the patrol the lady had very plainly perceived
 Rinuccio, with Alessandro on his back, as also that Alessandro had
 the grave-clothes upon him; and much did she marvel at the daring
 of both, but, for all that, she laughed heartily to see Rinuccio drop
 Alessandro, and Alessandro run away.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09010033"/>Overjoyed at the turn the
 affair had taken, and praising God that He had rid her of their harass,
 she withdrew from the window, and betook her to her chamber,
 averring to her maid that for certain they must both be mightily in
 love with her, seeing that 'twas plain they had both done her
 bidding.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09010034"/>Crestfallen and cursing his evil fortune, Rinuccio nevertheless
 went not home, but, as soon as the street was clear of the patrol,
 came back to the spot where he had dropped Alessandro, and stooped
 down and began feeling about, if haply he might find him, and so do
 his devoir to the lady; but, as he found him not, he supposed the
 patrol must have borne him thence, and so at last home he went; as
 did also Alessandro, knowing not what else to do, and deploring his
 mishap.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09010035"/>On the morrow, Scannadio's tomb being found open and
 <pb n="270"/>empty, for Alessandro had thrown the corpse into the vault below,
 all <placeName>Pistoia</placeName> debated of the matter with no small diversity of opinion,
 the fools believing that Scannadio had been carried off by devils.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09010036"/>Neither of the lovers, however, forbore to make suit to the lady for
 her favour and love, telling her what he had done, and what had happened,
 and praying her to have him excused that he had not perfectly
 carried out her instructions. But she, feigning to believe neither of
 them, disposed of each with the same curt answer, to wit, that, as he
 had not done her bidding, she would never do aught for him.</p></div><pb n="271"/><!--*********************Novella 2******************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0902"><head>Novel II</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09020001"/><!--(i)-->An abbess rises in haste and in the dark, with intent to

 a charming air: <q>Now, Elisa, follow,</q> quoth she: whereupon Elisa
 began on this wise:</p></body></floatingText><floatingText type="frame"><body><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09020003"/>Dearest ladies, 'twas cleverly done of Madonna
 <placeName>France</placeName>sca, to disembarrass herself in the way we have heard: but I
 have to tell of a young nun, who by a happy retort, and the favour
 of Fortune, delivered herself from imminent peril.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09020004"/>And as you
 know that there are not a few most foolish folk, who, notwithstanding
 their folly, take upon themselves the governance and correction of
 others; so you may learn from my story that Fortune at times justly
 puts them to shame; which befell the abbess, who was the superior
 of the nun of whom I am about to speak.</p></body></floatingText><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09020005"/>You are to know, then, that in a convent in <placeName>Lombardy</placeName> of very
 great repute for strict and holy living there was, among other ladies
 that there wore the veil, a young woman of noble family, and extraordinary
 beauty. Now <persName>Isabetta</persName>--for such was her name--having
 speech one day of one of her kinsmen at the grate, became enamoured
 <pb n="272"/>of a fine young gallant that was with him; who, seeing her to be
 very fair, and reading her passion in her eyes, was kindled with a like
 flame for her: which mutual and unsolaced love they bore a great
 while not without great suffering to both.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09020006"/>But at length, both being
 intent thereon, the gallant discovered a way by which he might with
 all secrecy visit his nun; and she approving, he paid her not one visit
 only, but many, to their no small mutual solace.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09020007"/>But, while thus they
 continued their intercourse, it so befell that one night one of the
 sisters observed him take his leave of <persName>Isabetta</persName> and depart, albeit neither
 he nor she was ware that they had thus been discovered. The sister
 imparted what she had seen to several others. At first they were
 minded to denounce her to the abbess, one Madonna Usimbalda,
 who was reputed by the nuns, and indeed by all that knew her, to
 be a good and holy woman; but on second thoughts they deemed it
 expedient, that there might be no room for denial, to cause the abbess
 to take her and the gallant in the act. So they held their peace, and
 arranged between them to keep her in watch and close espial, that
 they might catch her unawares.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09020008"/>Of which practice <persName>Isabetta</persName> recking,
 witting nought, it so befell that one night, when she had her lover
 to see her, the sisters that were on the watch were soon ware of it,
 and at what they deemed the nick of time parted into two companies,
 of which one mounted guard at the threshold of <persName>Isabetta</persName>'s cell, while
 the other hasted to the abbess's chamber, and knocking at the door,
 roused her, and as soon as they heard her voice, said: <q>Up, Madam,
 without delay: we have discovered that <persName>Isabetta</persName> has a young man
 with her in her cell.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09020009"/>Now that night the abbess had with her a priest whom she used
 not seldom to have conveyed to her in a chest; and the report of the
 sisters making her apprehensive lest for excess of zeal and hurry they
 should force the door open, she rose in a trice; and huddling on
 her clothes as best she might in the dark, instead of the veil that
 they wear, which they call the psalter, she caught up the priest's
 breeches, and having clapped them on her head,  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09020010"/>hied her forth,
 and locked the door behind her, saying: <q>Where is this woman
 accursed of God?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09020011"/>And so, guided by the sisters, all so agog to catch
 <persName>Isabetta</persName> a sinning that they perceived not what manner of headgear
 the abbess wore, she made her way to the cell, and with their
 aid broke open the door; and entering they found the two lovers
 <pb n="273"/>abed in one another's arms; who, as it were, thunderstruck to be
 thus surprised, lay there, witting not what to do.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09020012"/>The sisters took
 the young nun forthwith, and by command of the abbess brought her
 to the chapter-house. The gallant, left behind in the cell, put on
 his clothes and waited to see how the affair would end, being minded
 to make as many nuns as he might come at pay dearly for any despite
 that might be done his mistress, and to bring her off with him.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09020013"/>The
 abbess, seated in the chapter-house with all her nuns about her, and
 all eyes bent upon the culprit, began giving her the severest reprimand
 that ever woman got, for that by her disgraceful and abominable conduct,
 should it get wind, she had sullied the fair fame of the convent;
 whereto she added menaces most dire.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09020014"/>Shamefast and timorous, the
 culprit essayed no defence, and her silence begat pity of her in
 the rest; but, while the abbess waxed more and more voluble, it
 chanced that the girl raised her head and espied the abbess's headgear,
 and the points that hung down on this side and that.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09020015"/>The significance
 whereof being by no means lost upon her, she quite plucked
 up heart, and: <q>Madam,</q> quoth she, <q>so help you God, tie up
 your coif, and then you may say what you will to me.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09020016"/>Whereto
 the abbess, not understanding her, replied: <q>What coif, lewd
 woman? So thou hast the effrontery to jest! Think'st thou that
 what thou hast done is a matter meet for jests?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09020017"/>Whereupon:
 <q>Madam,</q> quoth the girl again, <q>I pray you, tie up your coif, and
 then you may say to me whatever you please.</q> Which occasioned
 not a few of the nuns to look up at the abbess's head, and the abbess
 herself to raise her hands thereto, and so she and they at one and the
 same time apprehended <persName>Isabetta</persName>'s meaning.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09020018"/>Wherefore the abbess,
 finding herself detected by all in the same sin, and that no disguise
 was possible, changed her tone, and held quite another sort of language
 than before, the upshot of which was that 'twas impossible to withstand
 the assaults of the flesh, and that, accordingly, observing due
 secrecy as theretofore, all might give themselves a good time, as they
 had opportunity. So, having dismissed <persName>Isabetta</persName> to rejoin her lover in
 her cell, she herself returned to lie with her priest.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09020019"/>And many a
 time thereafter, in spite of the envious, <persName>Isabetta</persName> had her gallant to
 see her, the others, that lacked lovers, doing in secret the best they
 might to push their fortunes.</p></div><pb n="274"/><!--*********************Novella 3******************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0903"><head>Novel III</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09030001"/><!--(i)-->Master Simone, at the instance of Bruno and Buffalmacco

 began to think he must have a fever. And then up came Bruno;

 Simone, and before the maid arrived with the water, told him what
 was afoot. The Master, thus primed, inspected the water, and then

 and I will come at once, and let him know what is the matter with
 him, and what he must do.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09030020"/>With which message the maid was
 scarce returned, when the Master and Bruno arrived, and the Master,
 having seated himself beside <persName>Calandrino</persName>, felt his pulse, and by and by,
 in the presence of his wife, said: <q>Harkye, <persName>Calandrino</persName>, I speak to
 thee as a friend, and I tell thee that what is amiss with thee is just
 that thou art with child.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09030021"/>Whereupon <persName>Calandrino</persName> cried out querulously:
 <q>Woe's me! 'Tis thy doing, Tessa, for that thou must

 never a word by way of answer.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09030023"/><persName>Calandrino</persName> ran on in the same
 plaintive strain: <q>Alas! woe's me! What shall I do? How shall
 I be delivered of this child? What passage can it find? Ah! I see
 only too plainly that the lasciviousness of this wife of mine has been
 the death of me: God make her as wretched as I would fain be

 it, but she should not have it.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09030025"/>Which to hear, Bruno and Buffalmacco and Nello were like to

 at length, in answer to <persName>Calandrino</persName>'s appeals and entreaties for

 mayst dismiss thy fears, for, God be praised, we were apprised of thy
 state in such good time that with but little trouble, in the course of a

 I have here two hundred pounds, with which I had thoughts of buying
 an estate: take them all, all, if you must have all, so only I may escape
 being delivered, for I know not how I should manage it, seeing that
 women, albeit 'tis much easier for them, do make such a noise in
 the hour of their labour, that I misdoubt me, if I suffered so, I should
 die before I was delivered.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09030028"/><q>Disquiet not thyself,</q> said the
 doctor:
 <q>I will have a potion distilled for thee; of rare virtue it is, and not
 a little palatable, and in the course of three days 'twill purge thee of
 all, and leave thee in better fettle than a fish; but thou wilt do well
 to be careful thereafter, and commit no such indiscretions again.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09030029"/>Now to make this potion we must have three pair of good fat
 capons, and, for divers other ingredients, thou wilt give one of thy
 friends here five pounds in small change to purchase them, and thou
 wilt have everything sent to my shop, and so, please God, I will
 send thee this distilled potion to-morrow morning, and thou wilt
 take a good beakerful each time.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09030030"/>Whereupon: <q>Be it as you
 bid, Master mine,</q> quoth <persName>Calandrino</persName>, and handing Bruno five
 pounds, and money enough to purchase three pair of capons, he
 begged him, if it were not too much trouble, to do him the service
 to buy these things for him.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09030031"/>So away went the doctor, and made a
 little decoction by way of draught, and sent it him. Bruno bought
 the capons and all else that was needed to furnish forth the feast,
 with which he and his comrades and the doctor regaled them.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09030032"/><persName>Calandrino</persName> drank of the decoction for three mornings, after which
 he had a visit from his friends and the doctor, who felt his pulse, and
 then: <q>Beyond a doubt, <persName>Calandrino</persName>,</q> quoth he, <q>thou art cured,
 and so thou hast no more occasion to keep indoors, but needst have
 no fear to do whatever thou hast a mind to.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09030033"/>Much relieved,
 <persName>Calandrino</persName> got up, and resumed his accustomed way of life, and,
 wherever he found any one to talk to, was loud in praise of
 Master Simone for the excellent manner in which he had cured
 him, causing him in three days without the least suffering to
 be quit of his pregnancy. And Bruno and Buffalmacco and
 Nello were not a little pleased with themselves that they had so
 cleverly got the better of <persName>Calandrino</persName>'s niggardliness, albeit Monna

 contrariwise, inasmuch as the guile of one discomfited the good

 the manner whereof I am minded to relate to you.</p></body></floatingText><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09040005"/>'Tis not many years since there were in <placeName>Siena</placeName> two young men,
 both of age, and both alike named Cecco, the one being son of
 Messer Angiulieri, the other of Messer Fortarrigo. Who, albeit in
 many other respects their dispositions accorded ill, agreed so well in
 one, to wit, that they both hated their fathers, that they became
 friends, and kept much together.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09040006"/>Now Angiulieri, being a pretty
 <pb n="279"/>fellow, and well-mannered, could not brook to live at <placeName>Siena</placeName> on the
 allowance made him by his father, and learning that there was come
 into the March of <placeName>Ancona</placeName>, as legate of the Pope, a cardinal, to whom
 he was much bounden, resolved to resort to him there, thinking thereby
 to improve his circumstances. So, having acquainted his father with
 his purpose, he prevailed upon him to give him there and then all that
 he would have given him during the next six months, that he might
 have the wherewith to furnish himself with apparel and a good mount,
 so as to travel in a becoming manner.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09040007"/>And as he was looking out for
 some one to attend him as his servant, Fortarrigo, hearing of it,
 came presently to him and besought him with all earnestness to take
 him with him as his groom, or servant, or what he would, and he
 would be satisfied with his keep, without any salary whatsoever.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09040008"/>Whereto Angiulieri made answer that he was not disposed to take
 him, not but that he well knew that he was competent for any
 service that might be required of him, but because he was given to
 play, and therewithal would at times get drunk. Fortarrigo assured
 him with many an oath that he would be on his guard to commit
 neither fault, and added thereto such instant entreaties, that Angiulieri
 was, as it were, vanquished, and consented.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09040009"/>So one morning they
 took the road for <placeName>Buonconvento</placeName>, being minded there to breakfast.
 Now when Angiulieri had breakfasted, as 'twas a very hot day, he
 had a bed made in the inn, and having undressed with Fortarrigo's
 help, he composed himself to sleep, telling Fortarrigo to call him on
 the stroke of none.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09040010"/>Angiulieri thus sleeping, Fortarrigo repaired to
 the tavern, where, having slaked his thirst, he sate down to a game
 with some that were there, who speedily won from him all his money,
 and thereafter in like manner all the clothes he had on his back:
 wherefore he, being anxious to retrieve his losses, went, stripped as
 he was to his shirt, to the room where lay Angiulieri; and seeing
 that he was sound asleep, he took from his purse all the money
 that he had, and so went back to the gaming-table, and staked it, and
 lost it all, as he had his own.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09040011"/>By and by Angiulieri awoke, and got up, and dressed, and called
 for Fortarrigo; and as Fortarrigo answered not, he supposed that he
 must have had too much to drink, and be sleeping it off somewhere,
 as was his wont. He accordingly determined to leave him alone;
 and doubting not to find a better servant at <placeName>Corsignano</placeName>, he let saddle
 his palfrey and attach the valise; but when, being about to depart,
 <pb n="280"/>he would have paid the host, never a coin could he come by.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09040012"/>Whereat
 there was no small stir, so that all the inn was in an uproar, Angiulieri
 averring that he had been robbed in the house, and threatening
 to have them all arrested and taken to <placeName>Siena</placeName>;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09040013"/>when, lo, who should
 make his appearance but Fortarrigo in his shirt, intent now to steal
 the clothes, as he had stolen the moneys, of Angiulieri? And marking
 that Angiulieri was accoutred for the road: <q>How is this,
 Angiulieri?</q> quoth he. <q>Are we to start so soon? Nay, but wait
 a little. One will be here presently that has my doublet in pawn
 for thirty-eight soldi; I doubt not he will return it me for thirty-five
 soldi, if I pay money down.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09040014"/>And while they were yet talking,
 in came one that made it plain to Angiulieri that 'twas Fortarrigo
 that had robbed him of his money, for he told him the amount that
 Fortarrigo had lost. Whereat Angiulieri, in a towering passion,
 rated Fortarrigo right soundly, and, but that he stood more in fear of
 man than of God, would have suited action to word; and so,
 threatening to have him hanged by the neck and proclaimed an outlaw
 at the gallows-tree of <placeName>Siena</placeName>, he mounted his horse.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09040015"/>Fortarrigo, making as if 'twas not to him, but to another, that
 Angiulieri thus spoke, made answer: <q>Come now, Angiulieri, we
 were best have done with all this idle talk, and consider the matter
 of substance: we can redeem for thirty-five soldi, if we pay forth-with,
 but if we wait till to-morrow, we shall not get off with less
 than thirty-eight, the full amount of the loan; and 'tis because I
 staked by his advice that he will make me this allowance. Now why
 should not we save these three soldi?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09040016"/>Whereat Angiulieri waxed
 well-nigh desperate, more particularly that he marked that the
 bystanders were scanning him suspiciously, as if, so far from understanding
 that Fortarrigo had staked and lost his, Angiulieri's money,
 they gave him credit for still being in funds: so he cried out:
 <q>What have I to do with thy doublet? 'Tis high time thou wast
 hanged by the neck, that, not content with robbing me and gambling
 away my money, thou must needs also keep me in parley here and
 make mock of me, when I would fain be gone.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09040017"/>Fortarrigo, however,
 still persisted in making believe that Angiulieri did not mean
 this for him, and only said: <q>Nay, but why wilt not thou save me
 these three soldi? Think'st thou I can be of no more use to thee?
 Prithee, an thou lov'st me, do me this turn. Wherefore in such a
 hurry? We have time enough to get to <placeName>Torrenieri</placeName> this evening.
 <pb n="281"/><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09040018"/>Come now, out with thy purse. Thou knowest I might search <placeName>Siena</placeName>
 through, and not find a doublet that would suit me so well as this:
 and for all I let him have it for thirty-eight soldi, 'tis worth forty or

 that, after robbing him, Fortarrigo should now keep him clavering
 about the matter,  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09040019"/>Angiulieri made no answer, but turned his horse's
 head, and took the road for <placeName>Torrenieri</placeName>.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09040020"/>But Fortarrigo with cunning
 malice trotted after him in his shirt, and 'twas still his doublet, his
 doublet, that he would have of him: and when they had thus ridden
 two good miles, and Angiulieri was forcing the pace to get out of
 earshot of his pestering, Fortarrigo espied some husbandmen in a field
 beside the road a little ahead of Angiulieri, and fell a shouting to
 them amain: <q>Take thief! take thief!</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09040021"/>Whereupon they came
 up with their spades and their mattocks, and barred Angiulieri's way,
 supposing that he must have robbed the man that came shouting
 after him in his shirt, and stopped him and apprehended him; and
 little indeed did it avail him to tell them who he was, and how the
 matter stood.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09040022"/>For up came Fortarrigo with a wrathful air, and:
 <q>I know not,</q> quoth he, <q>why I spare to kill thee on the spot,
 traitor, thief that thou art, thus to despoil me and give me the slip!</q>
 And then, turning to the peasants: <q>You see, gentlemen,</q> quoth
 he, <q>in what a trim he left me in the inn, after gambling away all
 that he had with him and on him. Well indeed may I say that
 under God 'tis to you I owe it that I have thus come by my own
 again: for which cause I shall ever be beholden to you.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09040023"/>Angiulieri
 also had his say; but his words passed unheeded. Fortarrigo with
 the help of the peasants compelled him to dismount; and having
 stripped him, donned his clothes, mounted his horse, and leaving him
 barefoot and in his shirt, rode back to <placeName>Siena</placeName>, giving out on all hands
 that he had won the palfrey and the clothes from Angiulieri.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09040024"/>So
 Angiulieri, having thought to present himself to the cardinal in the
 March a wealthy man, returned to <placeName>Buonconvento</placeName> poor and in his
 shirt; and being ashamed for the time to shew himself in <placeName>Siena</placeName>,
 pledged the nag that Fortarrigo had ridden for a suit of clothes, and
 betook him to his kinsfolk at <placeName>Corsignano</placeName>, where he tarried, until he
 received a fresh supply of money from his father.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09040025"/>Thus, then,
 Fortarrigo's guile disconcerted Angiulieri's judicious purpose, albeit
 when time and occasion served, it was not left unrequited.</p></div><pb n="282"/><!--*********************Novella 5******************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0905"><head>Novel V</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050001"/><!--(i)--><persName>Calandrino</persName> being enamoured of a damsel, Bruno gives

 had among other estates a fine one at <placeName>Camerata</placeName>, on which he had
 a grand house built, and engaged Bruno and Buffalmacco to paint it
 throughout; in which task, for that 'twas by no means light, they associated
 with them Nello and <persName>Calandrino</persName>, and so set to work.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050007"/>There
 were a few rooms in the house provided with beds and other furniture,
 and an old female servant lived there as caretaker, but otherwise
 the house was unoccupied, for which cause Niccolò's son, <persName>Filippo</persName>,
 being
 a young man and a bachelor, was wont sometimes to bring thither a
 woman for his pleasure, and after keeping her there for a few days to
 escort her thence again.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050008"/>Now on one of these occasions it befell
 that he brought thither one <persName>Niccolosa</persName>, whom a vile fellow, named
 Mangione, kept in a house at <placeName>Camaldoli</placeName> as a common prostitute.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050009"/>And a fine piece of flesh she was, and wore fine clothes, and, for
 one of her sort, knew how to comport herself becomingly and talk
 agreeably.</p><p>Now one day at high noon forth tripped the damsel from her
 chamber in a white gown, her locks braided about her head, to
 wash her hands and face at a well that was in the courtyard of the
 house, and, while she was so engaged, it befell that <persName>Calandrino</persName> came
 there for water, and greeted her familiarly.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050010"/>Having returned his
 salutation, she, rather because <persName>Calandrino</persName> struck her as something
 out of the common, than for any other interest she felt in him,
 regarded him attentively. <persName>Calandrino</persName> did the like by her, and being
 smitten by her beauty, found reasons enough why he should not go
 back to his comrades with the water; but, as he knew not who she
 was, he made not bold to address her.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050011"/>She, upon whom his gaze
 was not lost, being minded to amuse herself at his expense, let her
 glance from time to time rest upon him, while she heaved a slight
 sigh or two. Whereby <persName>Calandrino</persName> was forthwith captivated, and
 tarried in the courtyard, until <persName>Filippo</persName> called her back into the chamber.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050012"/>Returned to his work, <persName>Calandrino</persName> sighed like a furnace: which
 Bruno, who was ever regardful of his doings for the diversion they

 <q>I should be in luck, had I but one to help me.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050014"/><q>How so?</q>
 quoth Bruno.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050015"/><q>Why,</q> returned <persName>Calandrino</persName>, <q>'tis not to go farther,
 <pb n="284"/>but there is a damsel below, fairer than a lamia, and so mightily in
 love with me that 'twould astonish thee. I observed it but now,
 when I went to fetch the water.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050016"/><q>Nay, but, <persName>Calandrino</persName>, make

 so,</q> replied <persName>Calandrino</persName>, <q>for he called her and she joined him in the
 chamber; but what signifies it? I would circumvent Christ Himself
 in such case, not to say <persName>Filippo</persName>. Of a truth, comrade, I tell thee
 she pleases me I could not say how.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050018"/><q>Comrade,</q> returned Bruno,
 <q>I will find out for thee who she is, and if she be <persName>Filippo</persName>'s wife, two
 words from me will make it all straight for thee, for she is much my
 friend. But how shall we prevent Buffalmacco knowing it? I can
 never have a word with her, but he is with me.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050019"/><q>As to Buffalmacco,</q>
 replied <persName>Calandrino</persName>, <q>I care not if he do know it; but let
 us make sure that it come not to Nello's ears, for he is of kin to
 Monna Tessa, and would spoil it all.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050020"/>Whereto: <q>Thou art in
 the right,</q> returned Bruno.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050021"/>Now Bruno knew what the damsel was, for he had seen her
 arrive, and moreover <persName>Filippo</persName> had told him. So, <persName>Calandrino</persName> having
 given over working for a while, and betaken him to her, Bruno
 acquainted Nello and Buffalmacco with the whole story; and thereupon
 they privily concerted how to entreat him in regard of this love
 affair.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050022"/>Wherefore, upon his return, quoth Bruno softly: <q>Didst
 see her?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050023"/><q>Ay, woe's me!</q> replied <persName>Calandrino</persName>: <q>she has
 stricken me to the death.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050024"/>Quoth Bruno: <q>I will go see if she
 be the lady I take her to be, and if I find that 'tis so, leave the
 rest to me.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050025"/>Whereupon down went Bruno, and found <persName>Filippo</persName> and
 the damsel, and fully apprised them what sort of fellow <persName>Calandrino</persName>
 was, and what he had told them, and concerted with them what
 each should do and say, that they might have a merry time together
	over <persName>Calandrino</persName>'s love affair. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050026"/>He then rejoined <persName>Calandrino</persName>, saying:
 <q>'Tis the very same; and therefore the affair needs very delicate
 handling, for, if <persName>Filippo</persName> were but ware thereof, not all <placeName>Arno</placeName>'s waters
 would suffice to cleanse us. However, what should I say to her
 from thee, if by chance I should get speech of her?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050027"/><q>I' faith,</q>
 replied <persName>Calandrino</persName>, <q>why, first, first of all, thou wilt tell her that I
 wish her a thousand bushels of the good seed of generation, and then
 that I am her servant, and if she is fain of--aught--thou tak'st
 me?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050028"/><q>Ay,</q> quoth Bruno, <q>leave it to me.</q></p><pb n="285"/><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050029"/>Supper-time came; and, the day's work done, they went down
 into the courtyard, <persName>Filippo</persName> and <persName>Niccolosa</persName> being there, and there
 they tarried a while to advance <persName>Calandrino</persName>'s suit. <persName>Calandrino</persName>'s gaze
 was soon riveted on <persName>Niccolosa</persName>, and such and so strange and startling
 were the gestures that he made that they would have given sight to
 the blind.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050030"/>She on her part used all her arts to inflame his passion,
 primed as she had been by Bruno, and diverted beyond measure as
 she was by <persName>Calandrino</persName>'s antics, while <persName>Filippo</persName>, Buffalmacco and the
 rest feigned to be occupied in converse, and to see nought of what
 passed.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050031"/>However, after a while, to <persName>Calandrino</persName>'s extreme disgust, they
 took their leave; and as they bent their steps towards <placeName>Florence</placeName>:
 <q>I warrant thee,</q> quoth Bruno to <persName>Calandrino</persName>, <q>she wastes away
 for thee like ice in the sunlight; by the body o' God, if thou
 wert to bring thy rebeck, and sing her one or two of thy love-songs,
 she'd throw herself out of window to be with thee.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050032"/>Quoth <persName>Calandrino</persName>:
 <q>Think'st thou, comrade, think'st thou, 'twere well I
 brought it?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050033"/><q>Ay, indeed,</q> returned Bruno. 
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050034"/>Whereupon:
 <q>Ah! comrade,</q> quoth <persName>Calandrino</persName>, <q>so thou wouldst not believe
 me when I told thee to-day? Of a truth I perceive there's ne'er
 another knows so well what he would be at as I.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050035"/>Who but I
 would have known how so soon to win the love of a lady like that?
 Lucky indeed might they deem themselves, if they did it, those
 young gallants that go about, day and night, up and down, a strumming
 on the one-stringed viol, and would not know how to gather
 a handful of nuts once in a millennium. Mayst thou be by to see
 when I bring her the rebeck! thou wilt see fine sport.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050036"/>List well
 what I say: I am not so old as I look; and she knows it right well:
 ay, and anyhow I will soon let her know it, when I come to grapple
 her. By the very body of Christ I will have such sport with her,
 that she will follow me as any love-sick maid follows her swain.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050037"/><q>Oh!</q> quoth Bruno, <q>I doubt not thou wilt make her thy prey:
 and I seem to see thee bite her dainty vermeil mouth and her cheeks,
 that shew as twin roses, with thy teeth, that are as so many lute-pegs,
 and afterwards devour her bodily.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050038"/>So encouraged, <persName>Calandrino</persName>
 fancied himself already in action, and went about singing and capering
 in such high glee that 'twas as if he would burst his skin.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050039"/>And so
 next day he brought the rebeck, and to the no small amusement
 of all the company sang several songs to her. And, in short, by
 <pb n="286"/>frequently seeing her, he waxed so mad with passion that he gave
 over working; and a thousand times a day he would run now to the
 window, now to the door, and anon to the courtyard on the chance
 of catching sight of her; nor did she, astutely following Bruno's
 instructions, fail to afford him abundance of opportunity.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050040"/>Bruno
 played the go-between, bearing him her answers to all his messages,
 and sometimes bringing him messages from her. When she was not
 at home, which was most frequently the case, he would send him
 letters from her, in which she gave great encouragement to his hopes,
 at the same time giving him to understand that she was at the house
 of her kinsfolk, where as yet he might not visit her.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050041"/>On this wise Bruno and Buffalmacco so managed the affair as to
 divert themselves inordinately, causing him to send her, as at her
 request, now an ivory comb, now a purse, now a little knife, and
 other such dainty trifles; in return for which they brought him, now
 and again, a counterfeit ring of no value, with which <persName>Calandrino</persName> was
 marvellously pleased. And <persName>Calandrino</persName>, to stimulate their zeal in his
 interest, would entertain them hospitably at table, and otherwise
 flatter them.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050042"/>Now, when they had thus kept him in play for two
 good months, and the affair was just where it had been, <persName>Calandrino</persName>,
 seeing that the work was coming to an end, and bethinking him that,
 if it did so before he had brought his love affair to a successful issue,
 he must give up all hopes of ever so doing, began to be very instant
 and importunate with Bruno.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050043"/>So, in the presence of the damsel, and
 by preconcert with her and <persName>Filippo</persName>, quoth Bruno to <persName>Calandrino</persName>:
 <q>Harkye, comrade, this lady has vowed to me a thousand times that
 she will do as thou wouldst have her, and as, for all that, she does
 nought to pleasure thee, I am of opinion that she leads thee by the
 nose: wherefore, as she keeps not her promises, we will make her
 do so, willy-nilly, if thou art so minded.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050044"/><q>Nay, but, for the love
 of God, so be it,</q> replied <persName>Calandrino</persName>, <q>and that speedily.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050045"/><q>Darest
 thou touch her, then, with a scroll that I shall give thee?</q> quoth
 Bruno.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050046"/><q>I dare,</q> replied <persName>Calandrino</persName>. 
 <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050047"/><q>Fetch me, then,</q> quoth
 Bruno, <q>a bit of the skin of an unborn lamb, a live bat, three grains of
 incense, and a blessed candle; and leave the rest to me.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050048"/>To catch
 the bat taxed all <persName>Calandrino</persName>'s art and craft for the whole of the evening;
 but having at length taken him, he brought him with the other
 matters to Bruno: who, having withdrawn into a room by himself,
 <pb n="287"/>wrote on the skin some cabalistic jargon, and handed it to him,
 saying:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050049"/><q>Know, <persName>Calandrino</persName>, that, if thou touch her with this
 scroll, she will follow thee forthwith, and do whatever thou shalt
 wish. Wherefore, should <persName>Filippo</persName> go abroad to-day, get thee somehow
 up to her, and touch her; and then go into the barn that is
 hereby--'tis the best place we have, for never a soul goes there--and
 thou wilt see that she will come there too. When she is there, thou
 wottest well what to do.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050050"/><persName>Calandrino</persName>, overjoyed as ne'er another,
 took the scroll, saying only: <q>Comrade, leave that to me.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050051"/>Now Nello, whom <persName>Calandrino</persName> mistrusted, entered with no less
 zest than the others into the affair, and was their confederate for
 <persName>Calandrino</persName>'s discomfiture; accordingly by Bruno's direction he hied
 to <placeName>Florence</placeName>, and finding Monna Tessa:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050052"/><q>Thou hast scarce forgotten,
 Tessa,</q> quoth he, <q>what a beating <persName>Calandrino</persName> gave thee,
 without the least cause, that day when he came home with the stones
 from <placeName>Mugnone</placeName>; for which I would have thee be avenged, and, so
 thou wilt not, call me no more kinsman or friend. He is fallen in
 love with a lady up there, who is abandoned enough to go closeting
 herself not seldom with him, and 'tis but a short while since they
 made assignation to forgather forthwith: so I would have thee go
 there, and surprise him in the act, and give him a sound trouncing.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050053"/>Which when the lady heard, she deemed it no laughing matter; but
 started up and broke out with: <q>Alas, the arrant knave! is't thus
 he treats me? By the Holy Rood, never fear but I will pay him
 out!</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050054"/>And wrapping herself in her cloak, and taking a young woman
 with her for companion, she sped more at a run than at a walk, escorted
 by Nello, up to <placeName>Camerata</placeName>. Bruno, espying her from afar, said to
 <persName>Filippo</persName>: <q>Lo, here comes our friend.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050055"/>Whereupon <persName>Filippo</persName> went
 to the place where <persName>Calandrino</persName> and the others were at work, and
 said: <q>My masters, I must needs go at once to <placeName>Florence</placeName>; slacken
 not on that account.</q> And so off he went, and hid himself where,
 unobserved, he might see what <persName>Calandrino</persName> would do.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050056"/><persName>Calandrino</persName>
 waited only until he saw that <persName>Filippo</persName> was at some distance, and then
 he went down into the courtyard, where he found <persName>Niccolosa</persName> alone,
 and fell a talking with her. She, knowing well what she had to do,
 drew close to him, and shewed him a little more familiarity than she
 was wont: whereupon <persName>Calandrino</persName> touched her with the scroll,  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050057"/>and
 having so done, saying never a word, bent his steps towards the
 <pb n="288"/>barn, whither <persName>Niccolosa</persName> followed him, and being entered, shut the
 door, and forthwith embraced him, threw him down on the straw
 that lay there, and got astride of him, and holding him fast by the
 arms about the shoulders, suffered him not to approach his face to
 hers, but gazing upon him, as if he were the delight of her heart:
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050058"/><q>O <persName>Calandrino</persName>, sweet my <persName>Calandrino</persName>,</q> quoth she, <q>heart of my
 body, my very soul, my bliss, my consolation, ah! how long have I
 yearned to hold thee in my arms and have thee all my own! Thy
 endearing ways have utterly disarmed me; thou hast made prize of
 my heart with thy rebeck. Do I indeed hold thee in mine embrace?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050059"/><persName>Calandrino</persName>, scarce able to move, murmured: <q>Ah! sweet
 my soul, suffer me to kiss thee.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050060"/>Whereto: <q>Nay, but thou art
 too hasty,</q> replied <persName>Niccolosa</persName>. <q>Let me first feast mine eyes on
 thee; let me but sate them with this sweet face of thine.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050061"/>Meanwhile Bruno and Buffalmacco had joined <persName>Filippo</persName>, so that
 what passed was seen and heard by all three. And while <persName>Calandrino</persName>
 was thus intent to kiss <persName>Niccolosa</persName>, lo, up came Nello with Monna
 Tessa. <q>By God, I swear they are both there,</q> ejaculated Nello,  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050062"/>as
 they entered the doorway; but the lady, now fairly furious, laid hold
 of him and thrust him aside, and rushing in, espied <persName>Niccolosa</persName> astride
 of <persName>Calandrino</persName>. <persName>Niccolosa</persName> no sooner caught sight of the lady, than
 up she jumped, and in a trice was beside <persName>Filippo</persName>.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050063"/>Monna Tessa fell
 upon <persName>Calandrino</persName>, who was still on the floor, planted her nails in his
 face, and scratched it all over: she then seized him by the hair, and
 haling him to and fro about the barn: <q>Foul, pestilent cur,</q> quoth
 she, <q>is this the way thou treatest me? Thou old fool! A murrain
 on the love I have borne thee! Hast thou not enough to do at

  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050064"/>And a fine lover thou wouldst make! Dost not know thyself,

 faith, 'twas not Tessa that got thee with child: God's curse on her,
 whoever she was: verily she must be a poor creature to be enamoured
 of a jewel of thy rare quality.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050065"/>At sight of his wife, <persName>Calandrino</persName>,
 suspended, as it were, between life and death, ventured no defence; but,
 his face torn to shreds, his hair and clothes all disordered, fumbled about
 for his capuche, which having found, up he got, and humbly besought
 his wife not to publish the matter, unless she were minded that he
 <pb n="289"/>should be cut to pieces, for that she that was with him was the wife
 of the master of the house. <q>Then God give her a bad year,</q>
 replied the lady.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050066"/>Whereupon Bruno and Buffalmacco, who by this
 time had laughed their fill with <persName>Filippo</persName> and <persName>Niccolosa</persName>, came up as if
 attracted by the noise; and after not a little ado pacified the lady,
 and counselled <persName>Calandrino</persName> to go back to <placeName>Florence</placeName>, and stay there,
 lest <persName>Filippo</persName> should get wind of the affair, and do him a mischief.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09050067"/>So <persName>Calandrino</persName>, crestfallen and woebegone, got him back to <placeName>Florence</placeName>
 with his face torn to shreds; where, daring not to shew himself at

 his wife's vituperation. Such was the issue, to which, after ministering

 company to laughter. However, when the ladies had done talking
 of his doings, the queen called for a story from Pamfilo, who thus
 spoke:</p></body></floatingText><floatingText type="frame"><body><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09060003"/>Worshipful ladies, this <persName>Niccolosa</persName>, that <persName>Calandrino</persName> loved,
 has brought to my mind a story of another <persName>Niccolosa</persName>; which I am
 minded to tell you, because 'twill shew you how a good woman
 by her quick apprehension avoided a great scandal.</p></body></floatingText><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09060004"/>In the plain of <placeName>Mugnone</placeName> there was not long ago a good man that
 furnished travellers with meat and drink for money, and, for that he
 was in poor circumstances, and had but a little house, gave not lodging
 to every comer, but only to a few that he knew, and if they were
 hard bested.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09060005"/>Now the good man had to wife a very fine woman,
 and by her had two children, to wit, a pretty and winsome girl of
 some fifteen or sixteen summers, as yet unmarried, and a little
 boy, not yet one year old, whom the mother suckled at her own
 breast.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09060006"/>The girl had found favour in the eyes of a goodly and
 mannerly young gentleman of our city, who was not seldom in those
 parts, and loved her to the point of passion. And she, being mightily
 flattered to be loved by such a gallant, studied how to comport herself
 <pb n="291"/>so
 debonairly as to retain his regard, and while she did so, grew
 likewise enamoured of him; and divers times, by consent of both
 their love had had its fruition, but that Pinuccio--such was the
 gallant's name--shrank from the disgrace that 'twould bring upon
 the girl and himself alike.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09060007"/>But, as his passion daily waxed apace,
 Pinuccio, yearning to find himself abed with her, bethought him that
 he were best contrive to lodge with her father, deeming, from what
 he knew of her father's economy, that, if he did so, he might effect
 his purpose, and never a soul be the wiser: which idea no sooner
 struck him, than he set about carrying it into effect.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09060008"/>So, late one evening Pinuccio and a trusty comrade, <persName>Adriano</persName> by
 name, to whom he had confided his love, hired two nags, and having
 set upon them two valises, filled with straw or such-like stuff, sallied
 forth of <placeName>Florence</placeName>, and rode by a circuitous route to the plain of
 <placeName>Mugnone</placeName>, which they reached after nightfall;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09060009"/>and having fetched a
 compass, so that it might seem as if they were coming from <placeName>Romagna</placeName>,
 they rode up to the good man's house, and knocked at the door.
 The good man, knowing them both very well, opened to them forthwith:
 whereupon: <q>Thou must even put us up to-night,</q> quoth
 Pinuccio; <q>we thought to get into <placeName>Florence</placeName>, but, for all the speed
 we could make, we are but arrived here, as thou seest, at this hour.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09060010"/><q>Pinuccio,</q> replied the host, <q>thou well knowest that I can but
 make a sorry shift to lodge gentlemen like you; but yet, as night
 has overtaken you here, and time serves not to betake you elsewhere,
 I will gladly give you such accommodation as I may.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09060011"/>The two
 gallants then dismounted and entered the inn, and having first looked
 to their horses, brought out some supper that they had carried with
 them, and supped with the host.</p><p>Now the host had but one little bedroom, in which were three
 beds, set, as conveniently as he could contrive, two on one side of the
 room, and the third on the opposite side, but, for all that, there was
 scarce room enough to pass through.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09060012"/>The host had the least discomfortable
 of the three beds made up for the two friends; and having
 quartered them there, some little while afterwards, both being awake,
 but feigning to be asleep, he caused his daughter to get into one of
 the other two beds, while he and his wife took their places in the
 third, the good woman setting the cradle, in which was her little boy,
 beside the bed.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09060013"/>Such, then, being the partition made of the beds,
 <pb n="292"/>Pinuccio,
 who had taken exact note thereof, waited only until he
 deemed all but himself to be asleep, and then got softly up and stole
 to the bed in which lay his beloved, and laid himself beside her; and
 she according him albeit a timorous yet a gladsome welcome, he
 stayed there, taking with her that solace of which both were most
 fain.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09060014"/>Pinuccio being thus with the girl, it chanced that certain things,
 being overset by a cat, fell with a noise that aroused the good woman,
 who, fearing that it might be a matter of more consequence, got up
 as best she might in the dark, and betook her to the place whence the
 noise seemed to proceed.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09060015"/>At the same time <persName>Adriano</persName>, not by reason
 of the noise, which he heeded not, but perchance to answer the call of
 nature, also got up, and questing about for a convenient place, came
 upon the cradle beside the good woman's bed; and not being able
 otherwise to go by, took it up, and set it beside his own bed, and
 when he had accomplished his purpose, went back, and giving never
 a thought to the cradle got him to bed.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09060016"/>The good woman searched
 until she found that the accident was no such matter as she had
 supposed; so without troubling to strike a light to investigate it
 further, she reproved the cat, and returned to the room, and groped
 her way straight to the bed in which her husband lay asleep; but not
 finding the cradle there, quoth she to herself: Alas! blunderer that
 I am, what was I about? God's faith! I was going straight to the
 guests' bed;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09060017"/>and proceeding a little further, she found the cradle, and
 laid herself down by <persName>Adriano</persName> in the bed that was beside it, taking
 <persName>Adriano</persName> for her husband; and <persName>Adriano</persName>, who was still awake, received
 her with all due benignity, and tackled her more than once to her
 no small delight.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09060018"/>Meanwhile Pinuccio fearing lest sleep should overtake him while
 he was yet with his mistress, and having satisfied his desire, got up
 and left her, to return to his bed; but when he got there, coming
 upon the cradle, he supposed that 'twas the host's bed; and so going
 a little further, he laid him down beside the host, who thereupon
 awoke.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09060019"/>Supposing that he had <persName>Adriano</persName> beside him: <q>I warrant
 thee,</q> quoth Pinuccio to the host, <q>there was never so sweet a piece
 of flesh as <persName>Niccolosa</persName>: by the body of God, such delight have I had
 of her as never had man of woman; and, mark me, since I left thee,
 I have gotten me up to the farm some six times.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09060020"/>Which tidings <pb n="293"/>the
 host being none too well pleased to learn, said first of all to
 himself: What the Devil does this fellow here? Then, his
 resentment getting the better of his prudence: <q>'Tis a gross affront
 thou hast put upon me, Pinuccio,</q> quoth he; <q>nor know I what
 occasion thou hast to do me such a wrong; but by the body of God
 I will pay thee out.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09060021"/>Pinuccio, who was not the most discreet of
 gallants, albeit he was now apprised of his error, instead of doing his
 best to repair it, retorted: <q>And how wilt thou pay me out?
 What canst thou do?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09060022"/><q>Hark what high words our guests are at
 together!</q> quoth meanwhile the host's wife to <persName>Adriano</persName>, deeming
 that she spoke to her husband.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09060023"/><q>Let them be,</q> replied <persName>Adriano</persName>
 with a laugh: <q>God give them a bad year: they drank too much
 yestereve.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09060024"/>The good woman had already half recognized her
 husband's angry tones, and now that she heard <persName>Adriano</persName>'s voice, she
 at once knew where she was and with whom. Accordingly, being
 a discreet woman, she started up, and saying never a word, took her
 child's cradle, and, though there was not a ray of light in the room,
 bore it, divining rather than feeling her way, to the side of the bed
 in which her daughter slept;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09060025"/>and then, as if aroused by the noise
 made by her husband, she called him, and asked what he and
 Pinuccio were bandying words about. <q>Hearest thou not,</q> replied
 the husband, <q>what he says he has this very night done to
 <persName>Niccolosa</persName>?</q><q>Tush! he lies in the throat,</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09060026"/>returned the good
 woman: <q>he has not lain with <persName>Niccolosa</persName>; for what time he might
 have done so, I laid me beside her myself, and I have been wide
 awake ever since; and thou art a fool to believe him. You men
 take so many cups before going to bed that then you dream, and
 walk in your sleep, and imagine wonders. 'Tis a great pity you do
 not break your necks. What does Pinuccio there? Why keeps he
 not in his own bed?</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09060027"/> Whereupon <persName>Adriano</persName>, in his turn, seeing how adroitly the good
 woman cloaked her own and her daughter's shame: <q>Pinuccio,</q>
 quoth he, <q>I have told thee a hundred times, that thou shouldst not
 walk about at night; for this thy bad habit of getting up in thy
 dreams and relating thy dreams for truth will get thee into a scrape
 some time or another: come back, and God send thee a bad night.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09060028"/>Hearing <persName>Adriano</persName> thus confirm what his wife had said, the host began
 to think that Pinuccio must be really dreaming; so he took him by <pb n="294"/>the
 shoulder, and fell a shaking him, and calling him by his name,
 saying: <q>Pinuccio, wake up, and go back to thy bed.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09060029"/>Pinuccio,
 taking his cue from what he had heard, began as a dreamer would be
 like to do, to talk wanderingly; whereat the host laughed amain.
 Then, feigning to be aroused by the shaking, Pinuccio uttered
 <persName>Adriano</persName>'s name, saying: <q>Is't already day, that thou callest me?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09060030"/><q>Ay, 'tis so,</q> quoth <persName>Adriano</persName>: <q>come hither.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09060031"/>Whereupon Pinuccio,
 making as if he were mighty drowsy, got him up from beside the host,
 and back to bed with <persName>Adriano</persName>. On the morrow, when they were
 risen, the host fell a laughing and making merry touching Pinuccio and
 his dreams.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09060032"/>And so the jest passed from mouth to mouth, while the
 gallants' horses were groomed and saddled, and their valises adjusted:
 which done, they drank with the host, mounted and rode to <placeName>Florence</placeName>,
 no less pleased with the manner than with the matter of the night's
 adventure.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09060033"/>Nor, afterwards, did Pinuccio fail to find other means of
 meeting <persName>Niccolosa</persName>, who assured her mother that he had unquestionably
 dreamed. For which cause the good woman, calling to mind
 <persName>Adriano</persName>'s embrace, accounted herself the only one that had watched.</p></div><pb n="295"/><!--*********************Novella 7******************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov0907"><head>Novel VII</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09070001"/><!--(i)-->Talano di Molese dreams that a wolf tears and rends all

 befell a neighbour of mine, for that she disbelieved a dream that her
 husband had.</p></body></floatingText><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09070004"/>I wot not if you knew Talano di Molese, a man right worthy to
 be had in honour; who, having married a young wife--Margarita
 by name--fair as e'er another, but without her match for whimsical,
 fractious, and perverse humours, insomuch that there was nought she
 would do at the instance of another, either for his or her own good,
 found her behaviour most grievous to bear, but was fain to endure
 what he might not cure.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09070005"/>Now it so befell that Talano and
 Margarita being together at an estate that Talano had in the contado,
 he, sleeping, saw in a dream a very beautiful wood that was on the
 estate at no great distance from the house, and his lady there walking.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09070006"/>And as she went, there leapt forth upon her a huge and fierce wolf that
 griped her by the throat, and bore her down to the ground, and (she
 shrieking the while for succour) would have carried her off by main
 force; but she got quit of his jaws, albeit her neck and face shewed as
 quite disfigured.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09070007"/>On the morrow, as soon as he was risen, Talano said
 <pb n="296"/>to
 his wife: <q>Albeit for thy perversity I have not yet known a single
 good day with thee, yet I should be sorry, wife, that harm should
 befall thee; and therefore, if thou take my advice, thou wilt not stir
 out of doors to-day.</q><q>Wherefore?</q> quoth the lady; and thereupon
 he recounted to her all his dream.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09070008"/>The lady shook her head, saying: <q>Who means ill, dreams ill.

 warrant thee that to-day and all days I will have a care to avoid

 <q>Well wist I,</q> replied Talano, <q>that thou wouldst so say,
 for such is ever the requital of those that comb scurfy heads; but
 whatever thou mayst be pleased to believe, I for my part speak to
 thee for thy good, and again I advise thee to keep indoors to-day, or
 at least not to walk in the wood.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09070010"/><q>Good,</q> returned the lady, <q>I
 will look to it,</q> and then she began communing with herself on this
 wise: Didst mark how artfully he thinks to have scared me from
 going into the wood to-day? Doubtless 'tis that he has an assignation
 there with some light o' love, with whom he had rather I did not
 find him. Ah! he would sup well with the blind, and what a fool
 were I to believe him! But I warrant he will be disappointed, and
 needs must I, though I stay there all day long, see what commerce it
 is that he will adventure in to-day.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09070011"/>Having so said, she quitted the house on one side, while her
 husband did so on the other; and forthwith, shunning observation as
 best she might, she hied her to the wood, and hid her where 'twas
 most dense, and there waited on the alert, and glancing, now this
 way and now that, to see if any were coming.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09070012"/>And while thus she
 stood, nor ever a thought of a wolf crossed her mind, lo, forth of
 a close covert hard by came a wolf of monstrous size and appalling
 aspect, and scarce had she time to say, God help me! before he sprang
 upon her and griped her by the throat so tightly that she might not
 utter a cry, but, passive as any lambkin, was borne off by him,  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09070013"/>and

 <pb n="297"/>that,

 folk called <persName>Ciacco</persName>, a man second to none that ever lived for inordinate
 gluttony, who, lacking the means to support the expenditure
 which his gluttony demanded, and being, for the rest, well-mannered
 and well furnished with excellent and merry jests, did, without turning
 exactly court jester, cultivate a somewhat biting wit, and loved
 to frequent the houses of the rich, and such as kept good tables;
 whither, bidden or unbidden, he not seldom resorted for breakfast or
 supper.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09080005"/>There was also in those days at <placeName>Florence</placeName> one that was called
 <persName>Biondello</persName>, a man very short of stature, and not a little debonair, more
 trim than any fly, with his blond locks surmounted by a coif, and
 never a hair out of place; and he and <persName>Ciacco</persName> were two of a trade.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09080006"/>Now one morning in Lent <persName>Biondello</persName>, being in the fish-market
 purchasing two mighty fat lampreys for Messer Vieri de' Cerchi, was
 <pb n="299"/>observed
 thus engaged by <persName>Ciacco</persName>, who came up to him, and:
 <q>What means this?</q> quoth he.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09080007"/><q>Why,</q> replied <persName>Biondello</persName>, <q>'tis
 that yestereve Messer Corso Donati had three lampreys much finer
 than these and a sturgeon sent to his house, but as they did not
 suffice for a breakfast that he is to give certain gentlemen, he has
 commissioned me to buy him these two beside. Wilt thou not be
	there?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09080008"/><q>Ay, marry, that will I,</q> returned <persName>Ciacco</persName>.  
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09080009"/>And in what
 he deemed due time he hied him to Messer Corso Donati's house, where
 he found him with some of his neighbours not yet gone to breakfast.
 And being asked by Messer Corso with what intent he was come,
 he answered: <q>I am come, Sir, to breakfast with you and your

 we then to breakfast, for 'tis now the time.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09080011"/>So to table they went,
 where nought was set before them but pease and the inward part of
 the tunny salted, and afterwards the common fish of the <placeName>Arno</placeName> fried.
 Wherefore <persName>Ciacco</persName>, not a little wroth at the trick that he perceived
 <persName>Biondello</persName> had played him, resolved to pay him out. And not many
 days after <persName>Biondello</persName>, who had meanwhile had many a laugh with his
 friends over <persName>Ciacco</persName>'s discomfiture,  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09080012"/>met him, and after greeting him,
 asked him with a laugh what Messer Corso's lampreys had been like.
 <q>That question,</q> replied <persName>Ciacco</persName>, <q>thou wilt be able to answer much
 better than I before eight days are gone by.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09080013"/>And parting from
 <persName>Biondello</persName> upon the word, he went forthwith and hired a cozening
 rogue, and having thrust a glass bottle into his hand, brought him
 within sight of the <placeName>Loggia de' Cavicciuli</placeName>; and there, pointing to a
 knight, one Messer <persName>Filippo</persName> Argenti, a tall man and stout, and of

  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09080016"/><q>Nothing

 forthwith, being a hasty man, jumped to the conclusion that
 <persName>Biondello</persName>, whom he knew, was making mock of him, and while an
 angry flush overspread his face: <q>'Colour the flask, forsooth!'</q>
 quoth he, <q>and 'Catamites!' God send thee and him a bad year!</q>
 and therewith up he started, and reached forward to lay hold of the
 rogue,  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09080018"/>who, being on the alert, gave him the slip and was off, and
 reported Messer <persName>Filippo</persName>'s answer to <persName>Ciacco</persName>, who had observed what
 had passed.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09080019"/>Having paid the rogue, <persName>Ciacco</persName> rested not until he had
 found <persName>Biondello</persName>, to whom: <q>Wast thou but now,</q> quoth he, <q>at
 the <placeName>Loggia de' Cavicciuli</placeName>?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09080020"/><q>Indeed no,</q> replied <persName>Biondello</persName>:
 <q>wherefore
 such a question?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09080021"/><q>Because,</q> returned <persName>Ciacco</persName>, <q>I may tell
 thee that thou art sought for by Messer <persName>Filippo</persName>, for what cause I know
 not.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09080022"/><q>Good,</q> quoth <persName>Biondello</persName>, <q>I will go thither and speak with

 what course the affair would take.</p><p>Now having failed to catch the rogue, Messer <persName>Filippo</persName> was still
 very wroth, and inly fumed and fretted, being unable to make out
 aught from what the rogue had said save that <persName>Biondello</persName> was set on
 by some one or another to flout him. And while thus he vexed his
 spirit, up came <persName>Biondello</persName>; whom he no sooner espied than he made
 for him, and dealt him a mighty blow in the face, and tore his hair

 'Colour the flask,' forsooth, and 'Catamites!' Dost take me for a

 <persName>Biondello</persName>'s face all over with a pair of fists that were liker to iron
 than aught else, until it was but a mass of bruises; he also tore and
 dishevelled all his hair, tumbled him in the mud, rent all his clothes
 upon his back, and that without allowing him breathing-space to ask
 why he thus used him, or so much as utter a word. <q>Colour me
 the flask!</q> and <q>Catamites!</q> rang in his ears;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09080027"/>but what the
 words signified he knew not.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09080028"/>In the end very badly beaten, and in
 very sorry and ragged trim, many folk having gathered around them,
 they, albeit not without the utmost difficulty, rescued him from

      with a sound mind, and we shall readily perceive that we women are
      one and all subjected by Nature and custom and law unto man, by
      him to be ruled and governed at his discretion; wherefore she, that
      would fain enjoy quietude and solace and comfort with the man to
      whom she belongs, ought not only to be chaste but lowly, patient
      and obedient: the which is the discreet wife's chief and most precious
      possession.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09090004"/>And if the laws, which in all matters have regard unto
      the common weal, and use and wont or custom (call it what you
      will), a power very great and to be had in awe, should not suffice to
      school us thereto; yet abundantly clear is the witness of Nature,
      which has fashioned our frames delicate and sensitive, and our spirits
      timorous and fearful, and has decreed that our bodily strength shall
      be slight, our voices tunable, and our movements graceful; which
      qualities do all avouch that we have need of others' governance.
       <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09090005"/>And whoso has need of succour and governance ought in all reason
      to be obedient and submissive and reverent towards his governor.
      And whom have we to govern and succour us save men? 'Tis then
      our bounden duty to give men all honour and submit ourselves unto
      them: from which rule if any deviate, I deem her most deserving
      not only of grave censure but of severe chastisement.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09090006"/>Which
      <pb n="303"/>reflections,
      albeit they are not new to me, I am now led to make by
      what but a little while ago <persName>Pampinea</persName> told us touching the perverse
      wife of Talano, on whom God bestowed that chastisement which
      the husband had omitted; and accordingly it jumps with my judgment
      that all such women as deviate from the graciousness, kindliness
      and compliancy, which Nature and custom and law prescribe, merit,
      as I said, stern and severe chastisement.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09090007"/>Wherefore, as a salutary
      medicine for the healing of those of us who may be afflicted with
      this disease, I am minded to relate to you that which was once
      delivered by Solomon by way of counsel in such a case. Which let
      none that stands not in need of such physic deem to be meant for
      her, albeit a proverb is current among men; to wit:</p><p><q type="proverb">	Good steed, bad steed, alike need the rowel's prick,
	Good wife, bad wife, alike demand the stick.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09090008"/>Which whoso should construe as a merry conceit would find you all
      ready enough to acknowledge its truth. But even in its moral
      significance I say that it ought to command assent.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09090009"/>For women are
      all by nature apt to be swayed and to fall; and therefore, for the
      correction of the wrong-doing of such as transgress the bounds
      assigned to them, there is need of the stick punitive; and also for the
      maintenance of virtue in others, that they transgress not these
      appointed bounds, there is need of the stick auxiliary and deterrent.
      However, to cut short this preachment, and to come to that which I
      purpose to tell you, I say:</p></body></floatingText><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09090010"/>That the bruit of the incomparable renown of the prodigious
 wisdom of Solomon, as also of the exceeding great liberality with
 which he accorded proof thereof to all that craved such assurance,
 being gone forth over well-nigh all the earth, many from divers parts
 were wont to resort to him for counsel in matters of most pressing
 and arduous importance; among whom was a young man, <persName>Melisso</persName>
 by name, a very wealthy nobleman, who was, as had been his fathers
 before him, of Lazistan, and there dwelt.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09090011"/>And as <persName>Melisso</persName> fared
 toward <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>, on his departure from Antioch he fell in with
 another young man, <persName>Giosefo</persName> by name, who was going the same way,
 and with whom, after the manner of travellers, he entered into converse.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09090012"/><persName>Melisso</persName>, having learned from <persName>Giosefo</persName>, who and whence he
 was, asked him whither he went, and on what errand: whereupon <pb n="304"/><persName>Giosefo</persName>
 made an answer that he was going to seek counsel of Solomon,
 how he should deal with his wife, who had not her match among
 women for unruliness and perversity, insomuch that neither entreaties
 nor blandishments nor aught else availed him to bring her to a better
 frame. And thereupon he in like manner asked <persName>Melisso</persName> whence he
 was, and whither he was bound, and on what errand:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09090013"/>whereto:
 <q>Of Lazistan, I,</q> replied <persName>Melisso</persName>, <q>and like thyself in evil plight;
 for albeit I am wealthy and spend my substance freely in hospitably
 entertaining and honourably entreating my fellow-citizens, yet for
 all that, passing strange though it be to think upon, I find never a
 soul to love me; and therefore I am bound to the self-same place as
 thou, to be advised how it may come to pass that I be beloved.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09090014"/>So the two men fared on together, and being arrived at <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>,
 were, by the good offices of one of Solomon's barons, ushered
 into his presence, and <persName>Melisso</persName> having briefly laid his case before the
 King, was answered in one word: <q>Love.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09090015"/>Which said, <persName>Melisso</persName>
 was forthwith dismissed, and <persName>Giosefo</persName> discovered the reason of his
 coming. To whom Solomon made no answer but: <q>Get thee
 to the <placeName>Bridge of Geese</placeName>.</q> Whereupon <persName>Giosefo</persName> was likewise promptly
 ushered out of the King's presence, and finding <persName>Melisso</persName> awaiting
 him, told him what manner of answer he had gotten.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09090016"/>Which
 utterances of the King the two men pondered, but finding therein
 nought that was helpful or relevant to their need, they doubted
 the King had but mocked them, and set forth upon their homeward
 journey.</p><p>Now when they had been some days on the road, they came to
 a river, which was spanned by a fine bridge, and a great caravan of
 sumpter mules and horses being about to cross, they must needs
 tarry, until the caravan had passed by.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09090017"/>The more part of which
 had done so, when it chanced that a mule turned sulky, as we know
 they will not seldom do, and stood stock still; wherefore a muleteer
 took a stick and fell a beating the mule therewith, albeit at first with
 no great vigour, to urge the mule forward.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09090018"/>The mule, however,
 swerving, now to this, now to the other side of the bridge, and sometimes
 facing about, utterly refused to go forward. Whereat the
 muleteer, wroth beyond measure, fell a belabouring him with the stick
 now on the head, now on the flanks, and anon on the croup, never
 so lustily, but all to no purpose.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09090019"/>Which caused <persName>Melisso</persName> and <persName>Giosefo</persName><pb n="305"/>ofttimes
 to say to him: <q>How now, caitiff? What is this thou
 doest? Wouldst kill the beast? Why not try if thou canst not
 manage him kindly and gently? He would start sooner so than for
 this cudgelling of thine.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09090020"/>To whom: <q>You know your horses,</q>
 replied the muleteer, <q>and I know my mule: leave me to deal with
 him.</q> Which said, he resumed his cudgelling of the mule, and laid
 about him on this side and on that to such purpose that he started
 him; and so the honours of the day rested with the muleteer.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09090021"/>Now,
 as the two young men were leaving the bridge behind them, <persName>Giosefo</persName>
 asked a good man that sate at its head what the bridge was called,
 and was answered: <q>Sir, 'tis called the <placeName>Bridge of Geese</placeName>.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09090022"/>Which
 <persName>Giosefo</persName> no sooner heard than he called to mind Solomon's words,
 and turning to <persName>Melisso</persName>: <q>Now, comrade, I warrant thee I may
 yet find Solomon's counsel sound and good, for that I knew not how
 to beat my wife is abundantly clear to me; and this muleteer has
 shewn me what I have to do.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09090023"/>Now some days afterwards they arrived at Antioch, where
 <persName>Giosefo</persName> prevailed upon <persName>Melisso</persName> to tarry with him and rest a day or
 two; and meeting with but a sorry welcome on the part of his wife,
 he told her to take her orders as to supper from <persName>Melisso</persName>, who, seeing
 that such was <persName>Giosefo</persName>'s will, briefly gave her his instructions; which
 the lady, as had been her wont, not only did not obey, but contravened
 in almost every particular.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09090024"/>Which <persName>Giosefo</persName> marking: <q>Wast
 thou not told,</q> quoth he angrily, <q>after what fashion thou wast to
 order the supper?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09090025"/>Whereto: <q>So!</q> replied the lady haughtily:
 <q>what means this? If thou hast a mind to sup, why take not thy
 supper? No matter what I was told, 'tis thus I saw fit to order it.
 If it like thee, so be it: if not, 'tis thine affair.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09090026"/><persName>Melisso</persName> heard the
 lady with surprise and inward disapprobation: <persName>Giosefo</persName> retorted:
 <q>Ay, wife, thou art still as thou wast used to be; but I will make
 thee mend thy manners.</q> Then, turning to <persName>Melisso</persName>: <q>Friend,</q>
 quoth he, <q>thou wilt soon prove the worth of Solomon's counsel:
 but, prithee, let it not irk thee to look on, and deem that what I shall
 do is but done in sport; and if thou shouldst be disposed to stand in
 my way, bear in mind how we were answered by the muleteer,
 when we pitied his mule.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09090027"/><q>I am in thy house,</q> replied <persName>Melisso</persName>,
 <q>and thy pleasure is to me law.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09090028"/>Thereupon <persName>Giosefo</persName> took a stout cudgel cut from an oak sapling, <pb n="306"/>and
 hied him into the room whither the lady had withdrawn from
 the table in high dudgeon, seized her by the hair, threw her on to
 the floor at his feet, and fell a beating her amain with the cudgel.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09090029"/>The lady at first uttered a shriek or two, from which she passed to
 threats; but seeing that, for all that, <persName>Giosefo</persName> slackened not, by the
 time she was thoroughly well thrashed, she began to cry him mercy,
 imploring him not to kill her, and adding that henceforth his will
 should be to her for law.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09090030"/>But still <persName>Giosefo</persName> gave not over, but with
 ever fresh fury dealt her mighty swingeing blows, now about the
 ribs, now on the haunches, now over the shoulders; nor had he
 done with the fair lady, until, in short, he had left never a bone or
 other part of her person whole, and he was fairly spent.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09090031"/>Then,
 returning to <persName>Melisso</persName>: <q>To-morrow,</q> quoth he, <q>we shall see
 whether 'Get thee to the <placeName>Bridge of Geese</placeName>' will prove to have been
 sound advice or no.</q> And so, having rested a while, and then washed
 his hands, he supped with <persName>Melisso</persName>.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09090032"/>With great pain the poor lady
 got upon her feet and laid herself on her bed, and having there taken
 such rest as she might, rose betimes on the morrow, and craved to
 know of <persName>Giosefo</persName> what he was minded to have to breakfast.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09090033"/><persName>Giosefo</persName>,
 laughing with <persName>Melisso</persName> over the message, gave her his directions, and
 when in due time they came to breakfast, they found everything
 excellently ordered according as it had been commanded: for which
 cause the counsel, which they had at first failed to understand, now
 received their highest commendation.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09090034"/>Some few days later <persName>Melisso</persName>, having taken leave of <persName>Giosefo</persName>,
 went home, and told a wise man the counsel he had gotten from
 Solomon. Whereupon: <q>And no truer or sounder advice could
 he have given thee,</q> quoth the sage: <q>thou knowest that thou
 lovest never a soul, and that the honours thou payest and the services
 thou renderest to others are not prompted by love of them, but by
 love of display. Love, then, as Solomon bade thee, and thou shalt
 be loved.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09090035"/>On such wise was the unruly chastised; and the young

 Gianni di Barolo, who, to eke out the scanty pittance his church
 afforded him, set a pack-saddle upon his mare, and took to going <pb n="308"/>the
 round of the fairs of <placeName>Apulia</placeName>, buying and selling merchandise.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09100007"/>And so it befell that he clapped up a close acquaintance with one
 Pietro da <placeName>Tresanti</placeName>, who plied the same trade as he, albeit instead of
 a mare he had but an ass; whom in token of friendship and goodfellowship
 Dom Gianni after the <placeName>Apulia</placeName>n fashion called ever Gossip
 Pietro, and had him to his house and there lodged and honourably
 entreated him as often as he came to <placeName>Barletta</placeName>.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09100008"/>Gossip Pietro on his
 part, albeit he was very poor and had but a little cot at <placeName>Tresanti</placeName>
 that scarce sufficed for himself, his fair, young wife, and their ass,
 nevertheless, whenever Dom Gianni arrived at <placeName>Tresanti</placeName>, made him
 welcome, and did him the honours of his house as best he might, in
 requital of the hospitality which he received at <placeName>Barletta</placeName>.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09100009"/>However,
 as Gossip Pietro had but one little bed, in which he slept with his
 fair wife, 'twas not in his power to lodge Dom Gianni as comfortably
 as he would have liked; but the priest's mare being quartered beside
 the ass in a little stable, the priest himself must needs lie beside her
 on the straw.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09100010"/>Many a time when the priest came, the wife, knowing
 how honourably he entreated her husband at <placeName>Barletta</placeName>, would
 fain have gone to sleep with a neighbour, one Zita <persName>Carapresa</persName> di
 Giudice Leo, that the priest might share the bed with her husband,
 and many a time had she told the priest so: howbeit he would never
 agree to it,  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09100011"/>and on one occasion: <q>Gossip <persName>Gemmata</persName>,</q> quoth he,
 <q>trouble not thyself about me; I am well lodged; for, when I am
 so minded, I turn the mare into a fine lass and dally with her, and
 then, when I would, I turn her back into a mare; wherefore I could
 ill brook to part from her.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09100012"/>The young woman, wondering but
 believing, told her husband what the priest had said, adding: <q>If
 he is even such a friend as thou sayst, why dost thou not get him
 to teach thee the enchantment, so that thou mayst turn me into a
 mare, and have both ass and mare for thine occasions? We should
 then make twice as much gain as we do, and thou couldst turn me
 back into a woman when we came home at night.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09100013"/>Gossip Pietro, whose wit was somewhat blunt, believed that 'twas
 as she said, approved her counsel, and began adjuring Dom Gianni,
 as persuasively as he might, to teach him the incantation. Dom
 Gianni did his best to wean him of his folly; but as all was in vain:
 <q>Lo, now,</q> quoth he, <q>as you are both bent on it, we will be up,
 as is our wont, before the sun to-morrow morning, and I will shew <pb n="309"/>you
 how 'tis done. The truth is that 'tis in the attachment of the

 sleep had either Gossip Pietro or Gossip <persName>Gemmata</persName> that night, so great
 was their anxiety; and towards daybreak up they got, and called
 Dom Gianni; who, being risen, came in his shirt into Gossip Pietro's
 little bedroom, and: <q>I know not,</q> quoth he, <q>that there is
 another soul in the world for whom I would do this, save you, my
 gossips; however, as you will have it so, I will do it, but it behoves
 you to do exactly as I bid you, if you would have the enchantment
 work.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09100015"/>They promised obedience, and Dom Gianni thereupon took
 a light, which he handed to Gossip Pietro, saying: <q>Let nought
 that I shall do or say escape thee; and have a care, so thou wouldst
 not ruin all, to say never a word, whatever thou mayst see or hear;
 and pray God that the tail may be securely attached.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09100016"/>So Gossip
 Pietro took the light, and again promised obedience;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09100017"/>Dom Gianni
 caused Gossip <persName>Gemmata</persName> to strip herself stark naked, and stand on all
 fours like a mare, at the same time strictly charging her that, whatever
 might happen, she must utter no word. Then, touching her
 head and face: <q>Be this a fine head of a mare,</q> quoth he; in like
 manner touching her hair, he said: <q>Be this a fine mane of a
 mare;</q> touching her arms: <q>Be these fine legs and fine hooves of
 a mare;</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09100018"/>then, as he touched her breast and felt its firm roundness,
 and there awoke and arose one that was not called: <q>And be this
 a fine breast of a mare,</q> quoth he; and in like manner he dealt with
 her back, belly, croup, thighs, and legs. Last of all, the work being
 complete save for the tail, he lifted his shirt and took in his hand the
 tool with which he was used to plant men, and forthwith thrust it
 into the furrow made for it, saying: <q>And be this a fine tail of a
 mare.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09100019"/>Whereat Gossip Pietro, who had followed everything very
 heedfully to that point, disapproving that last particular, exclaimed:
 <q>No! Dom Gianni, I'll have no tail, I'll have no tail.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09100020"/>The
 essential juice, by which all plants are propagated, was already discharged,
 when Dom Gianni withdrew the tool, saying: <q>Alas!
 Gossip Pietro, what hast thou done? Did I not tell thee to say never
 a word, no matter what thou mightst see? The mare was all but
 made; but by speaking thou hast spoiled all; and 'tis not possible to
 repeat the enchantment.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09100021"/><q>Well and good,</q> replied Gossip Pietro,
 <q>I would have none of that tail. Why saidst thou not to me: <pb n="310"/>'Make
 it thou'? And besides, thou wast attaching it too low.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09100022"/><q>'Twas because,</q> returned Dom Gianni, <q>thou wouldst not have
 known, on the first essay, how to attach it so well as I.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09100023"/>Whereupon
 the young woman stood up, and in all good faith said to her
 husband: <q>Fool that thou art, wherefore hast thou brought to
 nought what had been for the good of us both? When didst thou
 ever see mare without a tail? So help me God, poor as thou art,
 thou deservest to be poorer still.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09100024"/>So, after Gossip Pietro's ill-timed
 speech, there being no way left of turning the young woman into a

 to the fair of <placeName>Bitonto</placeName>, and never asked him so to serve him again.</p></div><!--*********************Conclusion******************************--><div type="conclusion" corresp="d09conclu"><head>Conclusion</head><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p09970001"/>What laughter this story drew from the ladies, who understood it

  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00010004"/>Who, being wealthy and magnanimous, reflecting on the customs and

 like to find little or no occasion of shewing his mettle, and accordingly
 resolved to pass some time at the court of Alfonso, King of <placeName>Spain</placeName>,
 who for the fame of his high qualities was without a peer among the
 potentates of his age. So, being well provided with arms and horses
 and retinue suitable to his rank, he hied him to <placeName>Spain</placeName>, where he was
 graciously received by the King.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00010005"/>There tarrying accordingly, Messer
 Ruggieri very soon, as well by the splendid style in which he lived
 as by the prodigious feats of arms that he did, gave folk to know his
 high desert.</p><p>Now, having tarried there some while, and observed the King's
 <pb n="315"/>ways with much care, and how he would grant castles, cities, or
 baronies, to this, that, or the other of his subjects, he deemed that
 the King shewed therein but little judgment, seeing that he would
 give them to men that merited them not. And for that nought was
 given to him, he, knowing his merit, deemed himself gravely injured
 in reputation; wherefore he made up his mind to depart the realm,
 and to that end craved license of the King;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00010006"/>which the King granted
 him, and therewith gave him one of the best and finest mules that
 was ever ridden, a gift which Messer Ruggieri, as he had a long
 journey to make, did not a little appreciate.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00010007"/>The King then bade
 one of his discreet domestics contrive, as best he might, to ride with
 Messer Ruggieri on such wise that it might not appear that he did
 so by the King's command, and charge his memory with whatever
 Messer Ruggieri might say of him, so that he might be able to repeat
 it; which done, he was on the very next morning to bid Ruggieri
 return to the King forthwith.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00010008"/>The King's agent was on the
 alert, and no sooner was Ruggieri out of the city, than without any
 manner of difficulty he joined his company, giving out that he was
 going towards <placeName>Italy</placeName>.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00010009"/>As thus they rode, talking of divers matters,
 Messer Ruggieri being mounted on the mule given him by the
 King: <q>Methinks,</q> quoth the other, it being then hard upon

 by, being come to a convenient place, they voided all the beasts save
 the mule. Then, as they continued their journey, the squire
 hearkening attentively to the knight's words, they came to a river,
 and while there they watered the beasts, the mule made a voidance
 in the stream. Whereat: <q>Ah, foul fall thee, beast,</q> quoth
 Messer Ruggieri, <q>that art even as thy master, that gave thee to me!</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00010011"/>Which remark, as also many another that fell from Ruggieri as they
 rode together throughout the day, the squire stored in his memory;
 but never another word did he hear Ruggieri say touching the King,
 that was not laudatory to the last degree.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00010012"/>On the morrow, when they were gotten to horse, and had set
 their faces towards <placeName>Tuscany</placeName>, the squire apprised Ruggieri of the

 likened him to the mule, or rather the mule to him.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00010014"/>Whereto
 <pb n="316"/>Messer Ruggieri answered frankly: <q>My lord, I likened you to the

 where meet it were, bestow them not, so the mule where 'twas meet,
 voided not, and where 'twas not meet, voided.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00010015"/><q>Messer Ruggieri,</q>
 replied the King, <q>'tis not because I have not discerned in you a
 knight most good and true, for whose desert no gift were too great,
 that I have not bestowed on you such gifts as I have bestowed upon
 many others, who in comparison of you are nothing worth: the
 fault is none of mine but solely of your fortune, which would not
 suffer me; and that this which I say is true, I will make abundantly
 plain to you.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00010016"/><q>My lord,</q> returned Messer Ruggieri, <q>mortified
 am I, not that you gave me no gift, for thereof I had no desire, being
 too rich, but that you made no sign of recognition of my desert;
 however, I deem your explanation sound and honourable, and
 whatever you shall be pleased that I should see, that gladly will I,
 albeit I believe you without attestation.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00010017"/>The King then led him into one of the great halls, in which, by
 his preordinance, were two chests closed under lock and key, and, not
 a few others being present, said to him: <q>Messer Ruggieri, one of
 these chests contains my crown, sceptre and orb, with many a fine
 girdle, buckle, ring, and whatever else of jewellery I possess; the
 other is full of earth: choose then, and whichever you shall choose,
 be it yours; thereby you will discover whether 'tis due to me or to
 your fortune that your deserts have lacked requital.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00010018"/>Such being the
 King's pleasure, Messer Ruggieri chose one of the chests, which at
 the King's command being opened and found to be that which
 contained the earth: <q>Now, Messer Ruggieri,</q> quoth the King
 with a laugh, <q>your own eyes may warrant you of the truth of what
 I say touching Fortune; but verily your merit demands that I take
 arms against her in your cause.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00010019"/>I know that you are not minded to
 become a Spaniard, and therefore I shall give you neither castle nor

 there with your neighbours justly vaunt yourself of your deserts,
 attested by my gifts.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00010020"/>Messer Ruggieri took the chest, and having

 to the knife upon every form of liberality. And albeit all men are
 by nature prone to avenge their wrongs, 'tis notorious that the clergy,
 however they may preach longsuffering, and commend of all things

 than the rest of mankind. Now this, to wit, after what manner a
 prelate shewed magnificence, will be made manifest to you in my

 and his high-handed deeds, being banished from <placeName>Siena</placeName>, and at enmity
 with the Counts of Santa Fiore, raised <placeName>Radicofani</placeName> in revolt against
 <pb n="318"/>the Church of <placeName>Rome</placeName>, and there abiding, harried all the surrounding
 country with his soldiers, plundering all wayfarers.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00020006"/>Now Pope
 Boniface VIII. being at <placeName>Rome</placeName>, there came to court the Abbot
 of Cluny, who is reputed one of the wealthiest prelates in the
 world; and having there gotten a disorder of the stomach, he was
 advised by the physicians to go to the baths of <placeName>Siena</placeName>, where (they
 averred) he would certainly be cured. So, having obtained the
 Pope's leave, reckless of the bruit of Ghino's exploits, he took the
 road, being attended by a great and well-equipped train of sumpter-horses
 and servants.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00020007"/>Ghino di Tacco, getting wind of his approach,
 spread his nets to such purpose as without the loss of so much as a
 boy to surround the abbot, with all his servants and effects, in a
 strait pass, from which there was no exit. Which done, he sent
 one of his men, the cunningest of them all, with a sufficient retinue to
 the abbot, who most lovingly on Ghino's part besought the abbot to
 come and visit Ghino at the castle.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00020008"/>Whereto the abbot, very wroth,
 made answer that he would none of it, for that nought had he to do
 with Ghino; but that he purposed to continue his journey, and
 would fain see who would hinder him.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00020009"/><q>Sir,</q> returned the envoy,
 assuming a humble tone, <q>you are come to a part of the country
 where we have no fear of aught save the might of God, and where
 excommunications and interdicts are one and all under the ban;
 wherefore you were best be pleased to shew yourself agreeable to
 Ghino in this particular.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00020010"/>As they thus spoke, Ghino's soldiers
 shewed themselves on every side, and it being thus manifest to the
 abbot that he and his company were taken prisoners, he, albeit
 mightily incensed, suffered himself with all his train and effects to be
 conducted by the envoy to the castle; where the abbot, being
 alighted, was lodged in a small and very dark and discomfortable
 room, while his retinue, according to their several conditions, were
 provided with comfortable quarters in divers parts of the castle, the
 horses well stabled and all the effects secured, none being in any
 wise tampered with.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00020011"/>Which done, Ghino hied him to the abbot,
 and: <q>Sir,</q> quoth he, <q>Ghino, whose guest you are, sends me to
 entreat you to be pleased to inform him of your destination, and the
 purpose of your journey.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00020012"/>The abbot, vailing his pride like a wise
 man, told whither he was bound and for what purpose. Whereupon
 Ghino left him, casting about how he might cure him without a
 <pb n="319"/>bath. To which end he kept a great fire ever burning in the little
 chamber, and had it closely guarded, and returned not to the abbot
 until the ensuing morning, when he brought him in a spotless napkin
 two slices of toast and a great beaker of vernaccia of <placeName>Corniglia</placeName>, being
 of the abbot's own vintage;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00020013"/>and: <q>Sir,</q> quoth he to the abbot,
 <q>Ghino, as a young man, made his studies in medicine, and avers that
 he then learned that there is no better treatment for disorder of the
 stomach than that which he will afford you, whereof the matters
 that I bring you are the beginning; wherefore take them and be of
 good cheer.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00020014"/>The abbot, being far too hungry to make many words about the
 matter, ate (albeit in high dudgeon) the toast, and drank the vernaccia;
 which done, he enlarged on his wrongs in a high tone, with
 much questioning and perpending; and above all he demanded to see
 Ghino.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00020015"/>Part of what the abbot said Ghino disregarded as of no
 substance, to other part he replied courteously enough; and having
 assured him that Ghino would visit him as soon as might be, he took
 his leave of him; nor did he return until the morrow, when he
 brought him toast and vernaccia in the same quantity as before;
 and so he kept him several days: then, having marked that the
 abbot had eaten some dried beans that he had secretly brought and
 left there of set purpose,  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00020016"/>he asked him in Ghino's name how he
 felt in the stomach. <q>Were I but out of Ghino's hands,</q> replied the
 abbot, <q>I should feel myself well, indeed: next to which, I desire
 most of all a good breakfast, so excellent a cure have his medicines
 wrought on me.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00020017"/>Whereupon Ghino caused the abbot's servants to
 furnish a goodly chamber with the abbot's own effects, and there
 on the morrow make ready a grand banquet, at which all the abbot's
 suite and not a few of the garrison being assembled, he hied him to
 the abbot, and: <q>Sir,</q> quoth he, <q>'tis time you left the infirmary,
 seeing that you now feel yourself well;</q> and so saying, he took him
 by the hand, and led him into the chamber made ready for him, and
 having left him there with his own people, made it his chief concern
 that the banquet should be magnificent.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00020018"/>The abbot's spirits revived
 as he found himself again among his men, with whom he talked a
 while, telling them how he had been entreated, wherewith they
 contrasted the signal honour which they, on the other hand, had,
 one and all, received from Ghino.</p><pb n="320"/><p>Breakfast-time came, and with order meet the abbot and the
 rest were regaled with good viands and good wines, Ghino still
 suffering not the abbot to know who he was.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00020019"/>But when the abbot
 had thus passed several days, Ghino, having first had all his effects
 collected in a saloon, and all his horses, to the poorest jade, in the
 courtyard below, hied him to the abbot and asked him how he felt,
 and if he deemed himself strong enough to ride. The abbot replied
 that he was quite strong enough, and that 'twould be well indeed
 with him, were he once out of Ghino's hands.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00020020"/>Ghino then led him
 into the saloon in which were his effects and all his retinue, and
 having brought him to a window, whence he might see all his horses:
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00020021"/><q>Sir Abbot,</q> quoth he, <q>you must know that 'tis not for that he
 has an evil heart, but because, being a gentleman, he is banished from
 his home, and reduced to poverty, and has not a few powerful enemies,
 that in defence of his life and honour, Ghino di Tacco, whom you see
 before you, has become a robber of highways and an enemy to the
 court of <placeName>Rome</placeName>.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00020022"/>But such as I am, I have cured you of your malady
 of the stomach, and taking you to be a worthy lord, I purpose not to
 treat you as I would another, from whom, were he in my hands, as
 you are, I should take such part of his goods as I should think fit;
 but I shall leave it to you, upon consideration of my need, to assign
 to me such portion of your goods as you yourself shall determine.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00020023"/>Here are they before you undiminished and unimpaired, and from
 this window you may see your horses below in the courtyard;
 wherefore take the part or take the whole, as you may see fit, and
 be it at your option to tarry here, or go hence, from this hour
 forth.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00020024"/>The abbot marvelled to hear a highway robber speak thus
 liberally, and such was his gratification that his wrath and fierce
 resentment departed from him, nay, were transformed into kindness,
 insomuch that in all cordial amity he hasted to embrace Ghino,
 saying:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00020025"/><q>By God I swear, that to gain the friendship of a man such

 wrong than that which until now, meseemed, thou hadst done me.
 Cursed be Fortune that constrains thee to ply so censurable a trade.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00020026"/>Which said, he selected a very few things, and none superfluous,
 from his ample store, and having done likewise with the horses, ceded
 all else to Ghino, and hied him back to <placeName>Rome</placeName>;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00020027"/>where, seeing him,
 the Pope, who to his great grief had heard of his capture, asked him
 <pb n="321"/>what benefit he had gotten from the baths. Whereto the abbot
 made answer with a smile: <q>Holy Father, I found nearer here than
 the baths a worthy physician who has wrought a most excellent cure
 on me:</q> he then recounted all the circumstances, whereat the Pope
 laughed. Afterwards, still pursuing the topic, the abbot, yielding to
 the promptings of magnificence, asked a favour of the Pope;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00020028"/>who,
 expecting that he would ask somewhat else than he did, liberally
 promised to give him whatever he should demand. Whereupon:
 <q>Holy Father,</q> quoth the abbot, <q>that which I would crave of you
 is that you restore Ghino di Tacco, my physician, to your favour;
 seeing that among the good men and true and meritorious that I have
 known, he is by no means of the least account. And for the evil life
 that he leads, I impute it to Fortune rather than to him:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00020029"/>change then
 his fortune, by giving him the means whereby he may live in manner
 befitting his rank, and I doubt not that in a little while your
 judgment of him will jump with mine.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00020030"/>Whereto the Pope, being
 magnanimous, and an admirer of good men and true, made answer
 that so he would gladly do, if Ghino should prove to be such as the
 abbot said; and that he would have him brought under safe conduct
 to <placeName>Rome</placeName>.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00020031"/>Thither accordingly under safe conduct came Ghino, to
 the abbot's great delight; nor had he been long at court before the
 Pope approved his worth, and restored him to his favour, granting
 him a great office, to wit, that of prior of the Hospital, whereof he
 made him knight. Which office he held for the rest of his life,
 being ever a friend and vassal of Holy Church and the Abbot of

 reception and honourable entertainment of gentlemen.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00030006"/>And so,
 <pb n="323"/>keeping a great array of excellent servants, he courteously and
 hospitably did the honours of his house to whoso came and went: in
 which laudable way of life he persevered, until not only the East, but
 well-nigh all the West had heard his fame;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00030007"/>which thus, what time
 he was well-stricken in years, albeit not for that cause grown weary
 of shewing courtesy, reached the ears of one <persName>Mitridanes</persName>, a young man
 of a country not far distant. Who, knowing himself to be no less
 wealthy than Nathan, grew envious of the renown that he had of his
 good deeds, and resolved to obliterate, or at least to obscure it, by a
 yet greater liberality.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00030008"/>So he had built for himself a palace like that
 of Nathan, of which he did the honours with a lavish courtesy that
 none had ever equalled, to whoso came or went that way; and verily
 in a short while he became famous enough.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00030009"/>Now it so befell that on a day when the young man was all alone
 in the courtyard of the palace, there came in by one of the gates a
 poor woman, who asked of him an alms, and had it; but, not content
 therewith, came again to him by the second gate, and asked another
 alms, and had it, and after the like sort did even unto the twelfth
 time; but, she returning for the thirteenth time: <q>My good
 woman,</q> quoth <persName>Mitridanes</persName>, <q>thou art not a little pertinacious in thy
 begging:</q> howbeit he gave her an alms.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00030010"/>Whereupon: <q>Ah!
 the wondrous liberality of Nathan!</q> quoth the beldam: <q>thirty-two
 gates are there to his palace, by every one of which I have entered,
 and asking alms of him, was never--for aught he shewed--recognized,
 or refused, and here, though I have entered as yet by but
 thirteen gates, I am recognized and reprimanded.</q> And therewith
 she departed, and returned no more.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00030011"/><persName>Mitridanes</persName>, who accounted
 the mention of Nathan's fame an abatement of his own, was kindled
 by her words with a frenzy of wrath, and began thus to commune
 with himself: Alas! when shall I attain to the grandeur of
 Nathan's liberality, to say nought of transcending it, as I would fain,
 seeing that in the veriest trifles I cannot approach him? Of a surety
 my labour is in vain, if I rid not the earth of him: which, since old
 age relieves me not of him, I must forthwith do with mine own
 hands.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00030012"/>And in the flush of his despite up he started, and giving
 none to know of his purpose, got to horse with a small company,
 and after three days arrived at the place where Nathan abode; and
 having enjoined his comrades to make as if they were none of his,
 <pb n="324"/>and knew him not, and to go quarter themselves as best they might
 until they had his further orders, he, being thus alone, towards
 evening came upon Nathan, also alone, at no great distance from
 his splendid palace. Nathan was recreating himself by a walk, and
 was very simply clad; so that <persName>Mitridanes</persName>, knowing him not, asked
 him if he could shew him where Nathan dwelt.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00030013"/><q>My son,</q> replied
 Nathan gladsomely, <q>that can none in these parts better than I;
 wherefore, so it please thee, I will bring thee thither.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00030014"/>The young
 man replied that 'twould be mighty agreeable to him, but that, if so
 it might be, he had a mind to be neither known nor seen by Nathan.
 <q>And herein also,</q> returned Nathan, <q>since 'tis thy pleasure, I will
 gratify thee.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00030015"/>Whereupon <persName>Mitridanes</persName> dismounted, and with Nathan,
 who soon engaged him in delightsome discourse, walked to the
 goodly palace. Arrived there Nathan caused one of his servants
 take the young man's horse, and drawing close to him, bade him
 in a whisper to see to it without delay that none in the house should
 tell the young man that he was Nathan: and so 'twas done.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00030016"/>Being come into the palace, Nathan quartered <persName>Mitridanes</persName> in a
 most goodly chamber, where none saw him but those whom he had
 appointed to wait upon him; and he himself kept him company,
 doing him all possible honour.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00030017"/>Of whom <persName>Mitridanes</persName>, albeit he
 reverenced him as a father, yet, being thus with him, forbore not to
 ask who he was. Whereto Nathan made answer: <q>I am a petty
 servant of Nathan: old as I am, I have been with him since my
 childhood, and never has he advanced me to higher office than this
 wherein thou seest me: wherefore, howsoever other folk may praise
 him, little cause have I to do so.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00030018"/>Which words afforded <persName>Mitridanes</persName>
 some hope of carrying his wicked purpose into effect with more of
 plan and less of risk than had otherwise been possible. By and by
 Nathan very courteously asked him who he was, and what business
 brought him thither; offering him such counsel and aid as he might
 be able to afford him.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00030019"/><persName>Mitridanes</persName> hesitated a while to reply: but
 at last he resolved to trust him, and when with no little circumlocution
 he had demanded of him fidelity, counsel and aid, he fully
 discovered to him who he was, and the purpose and motive of his
 coming thither.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00030020"/>Now, albeit to hear <persName>Mitridanes</persName> thus unfold his
 norrid design caused Nathan no small inward commotion, yet 'twas
 not long before courageously and composedly he thus made answer:
 <pb n="325"/><q>Noble was thy father, <persName>Mitridanes</persName>, and thou art minded to shew
 thyself not unworthy of him by this lofty emprise of thine, to wit,
 of being liberal to all comers: and for that thou art envious of
 Nathan's merit I greatly commend thee; for were many envious
 for a like cause, the world, from being a most wretched, would soon
 become a happy place.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00030021"/>Doubt not that I shall keep secret the
 design which thou hast confided to me, for the furtherance whereof
 'tis good advice rather than substantial aid that I have to offer thee.
 Which advice is this.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00030022"/>Hence, perhaps half a mile off, thou mayst
 see a copse, in which almost every morning Nathan is wont to walk,
 taking his pleasure, for quite a long while: 'twill be an easy matter
 for thee to find him there, and deal with him as thou mayst be
 minded.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00030023"/>Now, shouldst thou slay him, thou wilt get thee home with
 less risk of let, if thou take not the path by which thou camest
 hither, but that which thou seest issue from the copse on the left,
 for, though 'tis somewhat more rough, it leads more directly to thy
 house, and will be safer for thee.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00030024"/>Possessed of this information, <persName>Mitridanes</persName>, when Nathan had left
 him, privily apprised his comrades, who were likewise lodged in the
 palace, of the place where they were to await him on the ensuing
 day; which being come, Nathan, inflexibly determined to act in all
 respects according to the advice which he had given <persName>Mitridanes</persName>,
 hied him forth to the copse unattended, to meet his death.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00030025"/><persName>Mitridanes</persName>,
 being risen, took his bow and sword, for other arms he had
 none with him, mounted his horse, and rode to the copse, through
 which, while he was yet some way off, he saw Nathan passing, quite
 alone. And being minded, before he fell upon him, to see his face
 and hear the sound of his voice, as, riding at a smart pace, he came
 up with him, he laid hold of him by his head-gear, exclaiming:
 <q>Greybeard, thou art a dead man.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00030026"/>Whereto Nathan answered
 nought but: <q>Then 'tis but my desert.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00030027"/>But <persName>Mitridanes</persName>, hearing
 the voice, and scanning the face, forthwith knew him for the same
 man that had welcomed him heartily, consorted with him familiarly,
 and counselled him faithfully; whereby his wrath presently subsided,
 and gave place to shame. Wherefore, casting away the sword that
 he held drawn in act to strike, he sprang from his horse, and weeping,
 threw himself at Nathan's feet, saying:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00030028"/><q>Your liberality, dearest
 father, I acknowledge to be beyond all question, seeing with what
 craft you did plot your coming hither to yield me your life, for
 <pb n="326"/>which, by mine own avowal, you knew that I, albeit cause I had
 none, did thirst. But God, more regardful of my duty than I
 myself, has now, in this moment of supreme stress, opened the eyes
 of my mind, that wretched envy had fast sealed.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00030029"/>The prompter
 was your compliance, the greater is the debt of penitence that I owe
 you for my fault; wherefore wreak even such vengeance upon me
 as you may deem answerable to my transgression.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00030030"/>But Nathan
 raised <persName>Mitridanes</persName> to his feet, and tenderly embraced him, saying:
 <q>My son, thy enterprise, howsoever thou mayst denote it, whether
 evil or otherwise, was not such that thou shouldst crave, or I give,
 pardon thereof; for 'twas not in malice but in that thou wouldst
 fain have been reputed better than I that thou ensuedst it.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00030031"/>Doubt
 then no more of me; nay, rest assured that none that lives bears
 thee such love as I, who know the loftiness of thy spirit, bent not
 to heap up wealth, as do the caitiffs, but to dispense in bounty thine
 accumulated store.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00030032"/>Think it no shame that to enhance thy reputation
 thou wouldst have slain me; nor deem that I marvel thereat.
 To slay not one man, as thou wast minded, but countless multitudes,
 to waste whole countries with fire, and to raze cities to the ground
 has been well-nigh the sole art, by which the mightiest emperors and
 the greatest kings have extended their dominions, and by consequence
 their fame. Wherefore, if thou, to increase thy fame, wouldst fain
 have slain me, 'twas nothing marvellous or strange, but wonted.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00030033"/>Whereto <persName>Mitridanes</persName> made answer, not to excuse his wicked
 design, but to commend the seemly excuse found for it by Nathan,
 whom at length he told how beyond measure he marvelled that
 Nathan had not only been consenting to the enterprise, but had
 aided him therein by his counsel. But Nathan answered:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00030034"/><q>Liefer
 had I, <persName>Mitridanes</persName>, that thou didst not marvel either at my consent
 or at my counsel, for that, since I was my own master and of a mind
 to that emprise whereon thou art also bent, never a soul came to my
 house, but, so far as in me lay, I gave him all that he asked of me.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00030035"/>Thou camest, lusting for my life; and so, when I heard thee crave
 it of me, I forthwith, that thou mightst not be the only guest to
 depart hence ill content, resolved to give it thee; and to that end I
 gave thee such counsel as I deemed would serve thee both to the
 taking of my life and the preservation of thine own. Wherefore
 yet again I bid thee, nay, I entreat thee, if so thou art minded, to
 take it for thy satisfaction: I know not how I could better bestow
 <pb n="327"/>it.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00030036"/>I have had the use of it now for some eighty years, and
 pleasure and solace thereof; and I know that, by the course of
 Nature and the common lot of man and all things mundane, it can
 continue to be mine for but a little while; and so I deem that 'twere
 much better to bestow it, as I have ever bestowed and dispensed my
 wealth, than to keep it, until, against my will, it be reft from me by
 Nature.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00030037"/>'Twere but a trifle, though 'twere a hundred years: how
 insignificant, then, the six or eight years that are all I have to give!
 Take it, then, if thou hadst lief, take it, I pray thee; for, long as
 I have lived here, none have I found but thee to desire it; nor know
 I when I may find another, if thou take it not, to demand it of me.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00030038"/>And if, peradventure, I should find one such, yet I know that the
 longer I keep it, the less its worth will be; wherefore, ere it be thus
 cheapened, take it, I implore thee.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00030039"/>Sore shame-stricken, <persName>Mitridanes</persName> made answer: <q>Now God
 forefend that I should so much as harbour, as but now I did, such a
 thought, not to say do such a deed, as to wrest from you a thing
 so precious as your life, the years whereof, so far from abridging, I
 would gladly supplement with mine own.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00030040"/><q>So then,</q> rejoined
 Nathan promptly, <q>thou wouldst, if thou couldst, add thy years to
 mine, and cause me to serve thee as I never yet served any man, to
 wit, to take from thee that which is thine, I that never took aught
	from a soul!</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00030041"/><q>Ay, that would I,</q> returned <persName>Mitridanes</persName>.  
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00030042"/><q>Then,</q>
 quoth Nathan, <q>do as I shall bid thee. Thou art young: tarry
 here in my house, and call thyself Nathan; and I will get me to
 thy house, and ever call myself <persName>Mitridanes</persName>.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00030043"/>Whereto <persName>Mitridanes</persName>
 made answer: <q>Were I but able to discharge this trust, as you
 have been and are, scarce would I hesitate to accept your offer; but,
 as too sure am I that aught that I might do would but serve to
 lower Nathan's fame, and I am not minded to mar that in another
 which I cannot mend in myself, accept it I will not.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00030044"/>After which and the like interchange of delectable discourse,
 Nathan and <persName>Mitridanes</persName>, by Nathan's desire, returned to the palace;
 where Nathan for some days honourably entreated <persName>Mitridanes</persName>, and
 by his sage counsel confirmed and encouraged him in his high and
 noble resolve; after which, <persName>Mitridanes</persName>, being minded to return
 home with his company, took his leave of Nathan, fully persuaded
 that 'twas not possible to surpass him in liberality.</p></div><pb n="328"/><!--***********************************Novella 4*********************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov1004"><head>Novel IV</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040001"/><!--(i)-->Messer Gentile de' Carisendi, being come from <placeName>Modena</placeName>,

 have been recounted to you, young ladies; nay, so much of our
 field of discourse is already filled by their grandeur, that for us that
 are yet to tell, there is, methinks, no room left, unless we seek our
 topic there where matter of discourse germane to every theme does
 most richly abound, to wit, in the affairs of love.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040004"/>For which cause,

 lives, their honour and their reputation, in a thousand ways.</p></body></floatingText><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040005"/>Know, then, that at <placeName>Bologna</placeName>, that most famous city of <placeName>Lombardy</placeName>,
 there dwelt a knight, Messer Gentile Carisendi by name, worshipful
 alike for his noble lineage and his native worth: who in his youth,
 <pb n="329"/>being enamoured of a young gentlewoman named Madonna Catalina,
 wife of one Niccoluccio Caccianimico, and well-nigh despairing, for
 that the lady gave him but a sorry requital of his love, betook him
 to <placeName>Modena</placeName>, being called thither as Podestà.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040006"/>Now what time he
 was there, Niccoluccio being also away from <placeName>Bologna</placeName>, and his lady
 gone, for that she was with child, to lie in at a house she had some
 three miles or so from the city, it befell that she was suddenly
 smitten with a sore malady of such and so virulent a quality that it
 left no sign of life in her, so that the very physicians pronounced her
 dead.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040007"/>And for that the women that were nearest of kin to her
 professed to have been told by her, that she was not so far gone in
 pregnancy that the child could be perfectly formed, they, without
 more ado, laid her in a tomb in a neighbouring church, and after
 long lamentation closed it upon her.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040008"/>Whereof Messer Gentile being forthwith apprised by one of his
 friends, did, for all she had been most niggardly to him of her favour,
 grieve not a little, and at length fell a communing with himself on
 this wise: So, Madonna Catalina, thou art dead! While thou
 livedst, never a glance of thine might I have; wherefore, now that
 thou art dead, 'tis but right that I go take a kiss from thee.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040009"/>'Twas
 night while he thus mused; and forthwith, observing strict secrecy
 in his departure, he got him to horse with a single servant, and
 halted not until he was come to the place where the lady was interred;
 and having opened the tomb he cautiously entered it. Then, having
 lain down beside her, he set his face against hers; and again and
 again, weeping profusely the while, he kissed it.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040010"/>But as 'tis matter
 of common knowledge that the desires of men, and more especially
 of lovers, know no bounds, but crave ever an ampler satisfaction;
 even so Messer Gentile, albeit he had been minded to tarry there
 no longer, now said to himself: Wherefore touch I not her bosom
 a while? I have never yet touched it, nor shall I ever touch it
 again.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040011"/>Obeying which impulse, he laid his hand on her bosom, and
 keeping it there some time, felt, as he thought, her heart faintly
 beating.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040012"/>Whereupon, banishing all fear, and examining the body
 with closer attention, he discovered that life was not extinct, though
 he judged it but scant and flickering: and so, aided by his servant,
 he bore her, as gently as he might, out of the tomb; and set her
 before him upon his horse, and brought her privily to his house at
 <pb n="330"/><placeName>Bologna</placeName>,  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040013"/>where dwelt his wise and worthy mother, who, being fully
 apprised by him of the circumstances, took pity on the lady, and had
 a huge fire kindled, and a bath made ready, whereby she restored
 her to life. Whereof the first sign she gave was to heave a great
 sigh, and murmur: <q>Alas! where am I?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040014"/>To which the worthy
 lady made answer: <q>Be of good cheer; thou art well lodged.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040015"/>By and by the lady, coming to herself, looked about her; and finding
 herself she knew not where, and seeing Messer Gentile before her,
 was filled with wonder, and besought his mother to tell her how she
 came to be there.</p><p>Messer Gentile thereupon told her all.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040016"/>Sore distressed thereat,
 the lady, after a while, thanked him as best she might; after which
 she besought him by the love that he had borne her, and of his
 courtesy, that she might, while she tarried in his house, be spared
 aught that could impair her honour and her husband's; and that at
 daybreak he would suffer her to return home.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040017"/><q>Madam,</q> replied
 Messer Gentile, <q>however I did affect you in time past, since God
 in His goodness has, by means of the love I bore you, restored you
 to me alive, I mean not now, or at any time hereafter, to entreat
 you either here or elsewhere, save as a dear sister;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040018"/>but yet the
 service I have to-night rendered you merits some guerdon: and
 therefore lief had I that you deny me not a favour which I shall ask
 of you.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040019"/>Whereto the lady graciously made answer that she would
 be prompt to grant it, so only it were in her power, and consonant
 with her honour. Said then Messer Gentile: <q>Your kinsfolk,
 Madam, one and all, nay, all the folk in <placeName>Bologna</placeName> are fully persuaded
 that you are dead: there is therefore none to expect you at home:
 wherefore the favour I crave of you is this, that you will be pleased
 to tarry privily here with my mother, until such time--which will
 be speedily--as I return from <placeName>Modena</placeName>.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040020"/>And 'tis for that I purpose
 to make solemn and joyous donation of you to your husband in
 presence of the most honourable folk of this city that I ask of you
 this grace.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040021"/>Mindful of what she owed the knight, and witting
 that what he craved was seemly, the lady, albeit she yearned not a
 little to gladden her kinsfolk with the sight of her in the flesh, consented
 to do as Messer Gentile besought her, and thereto pledged
 him her faith.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040022"/>And scarce had she done so, when she felt that the
 hour of her travail was come; and so, tenderly succoured by Messer
 <pb n="331"/>Gentile's mother, she not long after gave birth to a fine boy. Which
 event did mightily enhance her own and Messer Gentile's happiness.
 Then, having made all meet provision for her, and left word that
 she was to be tended as if she were his own wife, Messer Gentile,
 observing strict secrecy, returned to <placeName>Modena</placeName>.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040023"/>His time of office there ended, in anticipation of his return to
 <placeName>Bologna</placeName>, he appointed for the morning of his arrival in the city a
 great and goodly banquet at his house, whereto were bidden not a
 few of the gentlemen of <placeName>Bologna</placeName>, and among them Niccoluccio
 Caccianimico. Whom, when he was returned and dismounted, he
 found awaiting him, as also the lady, fairer and more healthful than
 ever, and her little son doing well; and so with a gladness beyond
 compare he ranged his guests at table, and regaled them with many
 a course magnificently served.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040024"/>And towards the close of the feast,
 having premonished the lady of his intention, and concerted with
 her how she should behave, thus he spoke: <q>Gentlemen, I mind
 me to have once heard tell of (as I deem it) a delightsome custom
 which they have in <placeName>Persia</placeName>; to wit, that, when one would do his
 friend especial honour, he bids him to his house, and there shews him
 that treasure, be it wife, or mistress, or daughter, or what not, that
 he holds most dear; assuring him that yet more gladly, were it
 possible, he would shew him his heart. Which custom I am minded
 to observe here in <placeName>Bologna</placeName>.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040025"/>You, of your courtesy, have honoured
 my feast with your presence, and I propose to do you honour in the
 <placeName>Persia</placeName>n fashion, by shewing you that which in all the world I do,
 and must ever, hold most dear. But before I do so, tell me, I pray
 you, how you conceive of a nice question that I shall lay before you.
	  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040026"/>Suppose that one has in his house a good and most faithful servant,
 who falls sick of a grievous disorder; and that the master tarries not
 for the death of the servant, but has him borne out into the open
 street, and concerns himself no more with him: that then a stranger
 comes by, is moved to pity of the sick man, and takes him to his
 house, and by careful tendance and at no small cost restores him to
 his wonted health.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040027"/>Now I would fain know whether the first
 master has in equity any just cause to complain of or be aggrieved
 with the second master, if he retain the servant in his employ, and
 refuse to restore him, when so required.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040028"/>The gentlemen discussed the matter after divers fashions, and
 <pb n="332"/>all agreed in one sentence, which they committed to Niccoluccio
 Caccianimico, for that he was an eloquent and accomplished speaker,
 to deliver on the part of them all.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040029"/>Niccoluccio began by commending
 the <placeName>Persia</placeName>n custom: after which he said that he and the others were
 all of the same opinion, to wit, that the first master had no longer
 any right in his servant, since he had not only abandoned but cast
 him forth; and that by virtue of the second master's kind usage of
 him he must be deemed to have become his servant; wherefore, by
 keeping him, he did the first master no mischief, no violence, no
 wrong. Whereupon the rest that were at the table said, one and all,
 being worthy men, that their judgment jumped with Niccoluccio's
 answer.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040030"/>The knight, well pleased with the answer, and that 'twas
 Niccoluccio that gave it, affirmed that he was of the same opinion;
 adding: <q>'Tis now time that I shew you that honour which I
 promised you.</q> He then called two of his servants, and sent them
 to the lady, whom he had caused to be apparelled and adorned with
 splendour, charging them to pray her to be pleased to come and
 gladden the gentlemen with her presence.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040031"/>So she, bearing in her
 arms her most lovely little son, came, attended by the two servants,
 into the saloon, and by the knight's direction, took a seat beside a
 worthy gentleman: whereupon: <q>Gentlemen,</q> quoth the knight,
 <q>this is the treasure that I hold, and mean ever to hold, more dear
 than aught else. Behold, and judge whether I have good cause.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040032"/>The gentlemen said not a little in her honour and praise, averring
 that the knight ought indeed to hold her dear: then, as they
 regarded her more attentively, there were not a few that would have
 pronounced her to be the very woman that she was, had they not
 believed that woman to be dead. But none scanned her so closely as
 Niccoluccio, who, the knight being withdrawn a little space, could
 no longer refrain his eager desire to know who she might be, but
 asked her whether she were of <placeName>Bologna</placeName>, or from other parts.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040033"/>The
 lady, hearing her husband's voice, could scarce forbear to answer;
 but yet, not to disconcert the knight's plan, she kept silence.
 Another asked her if that was her little boy; and yet another, if she
 were Messer Gentile's wife, or in any other wise his connection. To
 none of whom she vouchsafed an answer.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040034"/>Then, Messer Gentile
 coming up: <q>Sir,</q> quoth one of the guests, <q>this treasure of
 yours is goodly indeed; but she seems to be dumb: is she so?</q><pb n="333"/><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040035"/><q>Gentlemen,</q> quoth Messer Gentile, <q>that she has not as yet
 spoken is no small evidence of her virtue.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040036"/><q>Then tell us, you, who she
 is,</q> returned the other.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040037"/><q>That,</q> quoth the knight, <q>will I right
 gladly, so you but promise me, that, no matter what I may say, none
 of you will stir from his place, until I have ended my story.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040038"/>All
 gave the required promise, and when the tables had been cleared,
 Messer Gentile, being seated beside the lady, thus spoke:
 <q>Gentlemen, this lady is that loyal and faithful servant, touching
 whom a brief while ago I propounded to you my question, whom her
 own folk held none too dear, but cast out into the open street as a
 thing vile and no longer good for aught, but I took thence, and by
 my careful tendance wrested from the clutch of death; whom God,
 regardful of my good will, has changed from the appalling aspect of
 a corpse to the thing of beauty that you see before you.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040039"/>But for
 your fuller understanding of this occurrence, I will briefly explain it
 to you.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040040"/>He then recounted to them in detail all that had happened
 from his first becoming enamoured of the lady to that very hour;
 whereto they hearkened with no small wonder; after which:
 <q>And so,</q> he added, <q>unless you, and more especially Niccoluccio,
 are now of another opinion than you were a brief while ago, the
 lady rightly belongs to me, nor can any man lawfully reclaim her
 of me.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040041"/>None answered, for all were intent to hear what more he would
 say. But, while Niccoluccio, and some others that were there, wept
 for sympathy, Messer Gentile stood up, and took the little boy in his
 arms and the lady by the hand, and approached Niccoluccio, saying:
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040042"/><q>Rise, my gossip: I do not, indeed, restore thee thy wife, whom thy
 kinsfolk and hers cast forth; but I am minded to give thee this lady,
 my gossip, with this her little boy, whom I know well to be thy son,
 and whom I held at the font, and named Gentile:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040043"/>and I pray thee that
 she be not the less dear to thee for that she has tarried three months
 in my house; for I swear to thee by that God, who, peradventure,
 ordained that I should be enamoured of her, to the end that my love
 might be, as it has been, the occasion of her restoration to life, that
 never with her father, or her mother, or with thee, did she live more
 virtuously than with my mother in my house.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040044"/>Which said, he
 turned to the lady, saying: <q>Madam, I now release you from all
 promises made to me, and so deliver you to Niccoluccio.</q> Then,
 <pb n="334"/>leaving the lady and the child in Niccoluccio's embrace, he returned
 to his seat.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040045"/>Thus to receive his wife and son was to Niccoluccio a delight
 great in the measure of its remoteness from his hope. Wherefore in
 the most honourable terms at his command he thanked the knight,
 whom all the rest, weeping for sympathy, greatly commended for
 what he had done, as did also all that heard thereof.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040046"/>The lady,
 welcomed home with wondrous cheer, was long a portent to the
 Bolognese, who gazed on her as on one raised from the dead.
 Messer Gentile lived ever after as the friend of Niccoluccio, and his
 and the lady's kinsfolk.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040047"/>Now what shall be your verdict, gracious ladies? A king's largess,
 though it was of his sceptre and crown, an abbot's reconciliation,
 at no cost to himself, of a malefactor with the Pope, or an old man's
 submission of his throat to the knife of his enemy--will you adjudge
 that such acts as these are comparable to the deed of Messer Gentile?
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00040048"/>Who, though young, and burning with passion, and deeming himself
 justly entitled to that which the heedlessness of another had discarded,
 and he by good fortune had recovered, not only tempered his ardour
 with honour, but having that which with his whole soul he had long
 been bent on wresting from another, did with liberality restore it.
 Assuredly none of the feats aforesaid seem to me like unto this.</p></div><pb n="335"/><!--***********************************Novella 5*********************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov1005"><head>Novel V</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00050001"/><!--(i)-->Madonna Dianora craves of Messer Ansaldo a garden

 diversified by fine mountains and not a few rivers and clear
 fountains, is a city called <placeName>Udine</placeName>, where dwelt of yore a fair and
 noble lady, Madonna Dianora by name, wife of a wealthy grandee
 named Giliberto, a very pleasant gentleman, and debonair. Now
 this lady, for her high qualities, was in the last degree beloved by
 a great and noble baron, Messer Ansaldo Gradense by name, a
 man of no little consequence, and whose fame for feats of arms and
 courtesy was spread far and wide.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00050005"/>But, though with all a lover's
 ardour he left nought undone that he might do to win her love, and
 to that end frequently plied her with his ambassages, 'twas all in
 <pb n="336"/>vain. And the lady being distressed by his importunity, and chat,
 refuse as she might all that he asked of her, he none the less
 continued to love her and press his suit upon her, bethought her how
 she might rid herself of him by requiring of him an extraordinary
 and, as she deemed, impossible feat.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00050006"/>So one day, a woman that came
 oftentimes from him to her being with her: <q>Good woman,</q>
 quoth she, <q>thou hast many a time affirmed that Messer Ansaldo
 loves me above all else; and thou hast made proffer to me on his
 part of wondrous rich gifts which I am minded he keep to himself,
 for that I could never bring myself to love him or pleasure him for
 their sake; but, if I might be certified that he loves me as
 much as thou sayst, then without a doubt I should not fail to love
 him, and do his pleasure; wherefore, so he give me the assurance
 that I shall require, I shall be at his command.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00050007"/><q>What is it,
 Madam,</q> returned the good woman, <q>that you would have him do?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00050008"/><q>This,</q> replied the lady; <q>I would have this next ensuing January,
 hard by this city, a garden full of green grass and flowers and
 flowering trees, just as if it were May; and if he cannot provide me
 with this garden, bid him never again send either thee or any other
 to me, for that, should he harass me any further, I shall no longer
 keep silence, as I have hitherto done, but shall make my complaint
 to my husband and all my kinsmen, and it shall go hard but I will be
 quit of him.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00050009"/>The gentleman being apprised of his lady's stipulation and
 promise, notwithstanding that he deemed it no easy matter, nay, a
 thing almost impossible, to satisfy her, and knew besides that 'twas
 but to deprive him of all hope that she made the demand, did nevertheless
 resolve to do his endeavour to comply with it, and causing
 search to be made in divers parts of the world, if any he might find
 to afford him counsel or aid, he lit upon one, who for a substantial
 reward offered to do the thing by necromancy.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00050010"/>So Messer Ansaldo,
 having struck the bargain with him for an exceeding great sum of
 money, gleefully expected the appointed time. Which being come
 with extreme cold, insomuch that there was nought but snow and
 ice, the adept on the night before the calends of January wrought
 with his spells to such purpose that on the morrow, as was averred by
 eye-witnesses, there appeared in a meadow hard by the city one of
 the most beautiful gardens that was ever seen, with no lack of grass
 <pb n="337"/>and trees and fruits of all sorts.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00050011"/>At sight whereof Messer Ansaldo
 was overjoyed, and caused some of the finest fruits and flowers that
 it contained to be gathered, and privily presented to his lady, whom
 he bade come and see the garden that she had craved, that thereby
 she might have assurance of his love, and mind her of the promise
 that she had given him and confirmed with an oath, and, as a loyal
 lady, take thought for its performance.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00050012"/>When she saw the flowers
 and fruits, the lady, who had already heard not a few folk speak of
 the wondrous garden, began to repent her of her promise. But for
 all that, being fond of strange sights, she hied her with many other
 ladies of the city to see the garden, and having gazed on it with
 wonderment, and commended it not a little, she went home the
 saddest woman alive, bethinking her to what it bound her:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00050013"/>and so
 great was her distress that she might not well conceal it; but, being
 written on her face, 'twas marked by her husband, who was minded
 by all means to know the cause thereof.</p><p>The lady long time kept silence: but at last she yielded to his
 urgency, and discovered to him the whole matter from first to last.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00050014"/>Whereat Giliberto was at first very wroth; but on second thoughts,
 considering the purity of the lady's purpose, he was better advised,
 and dismissing his anger: <q>Dianora,</q> quoth he, <q>'tis not the act
 of a discreet or virtuous lady to give ear to messages of such a sort,
 nor to enter into any compact touching her chastity with any man
 on any terms. Words that the ears convey to the heart have a
 potency greater than is commonly supposed, and there is scarce
 aught that lovers will not find possible.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00050015"/>'Twas then ill done of thee
 in the first instance to hearken, as afterwards to make the compact;
 but, for that I know the purity of thy soul, that thou mayst be quit
 of thy promise, I will grant thee that which, perchance, no other man
 would grant, being also swayed thereto by fear of the necromancer,
 whom Messer Ansaldo, shouldst thou play him false, might, peradventure,
 cause to do us a mischief.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00050016"/>I am minded, then, that thou
 go to him, and contrive, if on any wise thou canst, to get thee quit of
 this promise without loss of virtue; but if otherwise it may not be,
 then for the nonce thou mayst yield him thy body, but not thy soul.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00050017"/>Whereat the lady, weeping, would none of such a favour at her
 husband's hands. But Giliberto, for all the lady's protestations, was
 minded that so it should be.</p><pb n="338"/><p>Accordingly, on the morrow about dawn, apparelled none too
 ornately, preceded by two servants and followed by a chambermaid,
 the lady hied her to Messer Ansaldo's house.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00050018"/>Apprised that his lady
 was come to see him, Messer Ansaldo, marvelling not a little, rose,
 and having called the necromancer: <q>I am minded,</q> quoth he,
 <q>that thou see what goodly gain I have gotten by thine art.</q> And
 the twain having met the lady, Ansaldo gave way to no unruly
 appetite, but received her with a seemly obeisance; and then the
 three repaired to a goodly chamber, where there was a great fire, and
 having caused the lady to be seated, thus spoke Ansaldo:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00050019"/><q>Madam,
 if the love that I have so long borne you merit any guerdon, I pray
 you that it be not grievous to you to discover to me the true occasion
 of your coming to me at this hour, and thus accompanied.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00050020"/>Shamefast,
 and the tears all but standing in her eyes, the lady made
 answer: <q>Sir, 'tis neither love that I bear you, nor faith that I
 pledged you, that brings me hither, but the command of my husband,
 who, regarding rather the pains you have had of your unbridled
 passion than his own or my honour, has sent me hither; and for that
 he commands it, I, for the nonce, am entirely at your pleasure.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00050021"/>If Messer Ansaldo had marvelled to hear of the lady's coming,
 he now marvelled much more, and touched by Giliberto's liberality,
 and passing from passion to compassion:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00050022"/><q>Now, God forbid,
 Madam,</q> quoth he, <q>that, it being as you say, I should wound the
 honour of him that has compassion on my love; wherefore, no
 otherwise than as if you were my sister shall you abide here, while
 you are so minded, and be free to depart at your pleasure; nor crave
 I aught of you but that you shall convey from me to your husband
 such thanks as you shall deem meet for courtesy such as his has been,
 and entreat me ever henceforth as your brother and servant.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00050023"/>Whereat overjoyed in the last degree: <q>Nought,</q> quoth the lady,
 <q>by what I noted of your behaviour, could ever have caused me to
 anticipate other sequel of my coming hither than this which I see is
 your will, and for which I shall ever be your debtor.</q> She then
 took her leave, and, attended by a guard of honour, returned to
 Giliberto, and told him what had passed; between whom and Messer
 Ansaldo there was thenceforth a most close and loyal friendship.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00050024"/>Now the liberality shewn by Giliberto towards Messer Ansaldo,
 and by Messer Ansaldo towards the lady, having been marked by
 <pb n="339"/>the necromancer, when Messer Ansaldo made ready to give him the
 promised reward: <q>Now God forbid,</q> quoth he, <q>that, as I have
 seen Giliberto liberal in regard of his honour, and you liberal in
 regard of your love, I be not in like manner liberal in regard of my
 reward, which accordingly, witting that 'tis in good hands, I am
 minded that you keep.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00050025"/>The knight was abashed, and strove hard
 to induce him to take, if not the whole, at least a part of the money;
 but finding that his labour was in vain, and that the necromancer,
 having caused his garden to vanish after the third day, was minded
 to depart, he bade him adieu. And the carnal love he had borne
 the lady being spent, he burned for her thereafter with a flame of
 honourable affection.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00050026"/>Now what shall be our verdict in this case,
 lovesome ladies? A lady, as it were dead, and a love grown lukewarm
 for utter hopelessness! Shall we set a liberality shewn in such
 a case above this liberality of Messer Ansaldo, loving yet as ardently,
 and hoping, perchance, yet more ardently than ever, and holding
 in his hands the prize that he had so long pursued? Folly indeed
 should I deem it to compare that liberality with this.</p></div><pb n="340"/><!--***********************************Novella 6*********************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov1006"><head>Novel VI</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00060001"/><!--(i)-->King Charles the Old, being conqueror, falls in love with

 albeit in no wise thereto actuated by his honour.</p></body></floatingText><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00060005"/>There is none of you but may not seldom have heard tell of King
 Charles the Old, or the First, by whose magnificent emprise, and the
 ensuing victory gained over King Manfred, the Ghibellines were driven
 forth of <placeName>Florence</placeName>, and the Guelfs returned thither. For which cause a
 knight, Messer Neri degli Uberti by name, departing <placeName>Florence</placeName> with
 <pb n="341"/>his household and not a little money, resolved to fix his abode under
 no
 other sway than that of King Charles.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00060006"/>And being fain of a lonely
 place in which to end his days in peace, he betook him to <placeName>Castello
 da Mare di Stabia</placeName>; and there, perchance a cross-bow-shot from the
 other houses of the place, amid the olives and hazels and chestnuts
 that abound in those parts, he bought an estate, on which he built a
 goodly house and commodious, with a pleasant garden beside it, in the
 midst of which, having no lack of running water, he set, after our
 Florentine fashion, a pond fair and clear, and speedily filled it with
 fish.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00060007"/>And while thus he lived, daily occupying himself with nought
 else but how to make his garden more fair, it befell that King
 Charles in the hot season betook him to Castello da Mare to refresh
 himself a while, and hearing of the beauty of Messer Neri's garden,
 was desirous to view it. And having learned to whom it belonged,
 he bethought him that, as the knight was an adherent of the party
 opposed to him, he would use more familiarity towards him than he
 would otherwise have done; and so he sent him word that he and
 four comrades would sup privily with him in his garden on the
 ensuing evening.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00060008"/>Messer Neri felt himself much honoured; and
 having made his preparations with magnificence, and arranged the
 order of the ceremonies with his household, did all he could and
 knew to make the King cordially welcome to his fair garden.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00060009"/>When the King had viewed the garden throughout, as also Messer
 Neri's house, and commended them, he washed, and seated himself at
 one of the tables, which were set beside the pond, and bade Count
 Guy de Montfort, who was one of his companions, sit on one side
 of him, and Messer Neri on the other, and the other three to
 serve, as they should be directed by Messer Neri.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00060010"/>The dishes that
 were set before them were dainty, the wines excellent and rare, the
 order of the repast very fair and commendable, without the least
 noise or aught else that might distress; whereon the King bestowed
 no stinted praise.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00060011"/>As thus he gaily supped, well-pleased with the
 lovely spot, there came into the garden two young maidens, each
 perhaps fifteen years old, blonde both, their golden tresses falling all
 in ringlets about them, and crowned with a dainty garland of
 periwinkle-flowers; and so delicate and fair of face were they that
 they shewed liker to angels than aught else, each clad in a robe of
 finest linen, white as snow upon their flesh, close-fitting as might be
 <pb n="342"/>from the waist up, but below the waist ample, like a pavilion to the
 feet.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00060012"/>She that was foremost bore on her shoulders a pair of nets,
 which she held with her left hand, carrying in her right a long pole.
 Her companion followed, bearing on her left shoulder a frying-pan,
 under her left arm a bundle of faggots, and in her left hand a tripod,
 while in the other hand she carried a cruse of oil and a lighted taper.
 At sight of whom the King marvelled, and gazed intent to learn
 what it might import.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00060013"/>The two young maidens came forward with
 becoming modesty, and did obeisance to the King; which done they
 hied them to the place of ingress to the pond, and she that had the
 frying-pan, having set it down, and afterward the other things, took
 the pole that the other carried, and so they both went down into the
 pond, being covered by its waters to their breasts.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00060014"/>Whereupon one
 of Messer Neri's servants, having forthwith lit a fire, and set the tripod
 on the faggots and oil therein, addressed himself to wait, until some
 fish should be thrown to him by the girls.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00060015"/>Who, the one searching
 with the pole in those parts where she knew the fish lay hid, while
 the other made ready the nets, did in a brief space of time, to the
 exceeding great delight of the King, who watched them attentively,
 catch fish not a few, which they tossed to the servant, who set them,
 before the life was well out of them, in the frying-pan. After
 which, the maidens, as pre-arranged, addressed them to catch some
 of the finest fish, and cast them on to the table before the King, and
 Count Guy, and their father.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00060016"/>The fish wriggled about the table to
 the prodigious delight of the King, who in like manner took some
 of them, and courteously returned them to the girls; with which
 sport they diverted them, until the servant had cooked the fish that
 had been given him: which, by Messer Neri's command, were set
 before the King rather as a side-dish than as aught very rare or
 delicious.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00060017"/>When the girls saw that all the fish were cooked, and that there
 was no occasion for them to catch any more, they came forth of the
 pond, their fine white garments cleaving everywhere close to their
 flesh so as to hide scarce any part of their delicate persons, took up
 again the things that they had brought, and passing modestly before
 the King, returned to the house.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00060018"/>The King, and the Count, and
 the other gentlemen that waited, had regarded the maidens with no
 little attention, and had, one and all, inly bestowed on them no little
 <pb n="343"/>praise, as being fair and shapely, and therewithal sweet and debonair;
 but 'twas in the King's eyes that they especially found favour.
 Indeed, as they came forth of the water, the King had scanned each
 part of their bodies so intently that, had one then pricked him, he
 would not have felt it,  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00060019"/>and his thoughts afterwards dwelling upon
 them, though he knew not who they were, nor how they came to
 be there, he felt stir within his heart a most ardent desire to pleasure
 them, whereby he knew very well that, if he took not care, he
 would grow enamoured; howbeit he knew not whether of the
 twain pleased him the more, so like was each to the other.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00060020"/>Having
 thus brooded a while, he turned to Messer Neri, and asked who the
 two damsels were. Whereto: <q>Sire,</q> replied Messer Neri, <q>they
 are my twin daughters, and they are called, the one, Ginevra the Fair,
 and the other, Isotta the Blonde.</q> Whereupon the King was loud
 in praise of them, and exhorted Messer Neri to bestow them in
 marriage. To which Messer Neri demurred, for that he no longer
 had the means.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00060021"/>And nought of the supper now remaining to serve,
 save the fruit, in came the two young damsels in gowns of taffeta
 very fine, bearing in their hands two vast silver salvers full of divers
 fruits, such as the season yielded, and set them on the table before
 the King.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00060022"/>Which done, they withdrew a little space and fell a
 singing to music a ditty, of which the opening words were as
 follows:</p><p><q type="song"><l>Love, many words would not suffice</l><l>There where I am come to tell.</l></q></p><p>And so dulcet and delightsome was the strain that to the King,
 his eyes and ears alike charmed, it seemed as if all the nine orders
 of angels were descended there to sing. The song ended, they
 knelt and respectfully craved the King's leave to depart; which,
 though sorely against his will, he gave them with a forced gaiety.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00060023"/>Supper ended, the King and his companions, having remounted
 their horses, took leave of Messer Neri, and conversing of divers
 matters, returned to the royal quarters;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00060024"/>where the King, still harbouring
 his secret passion, nor, despite affairs of state that supervened,
 being able to forget the beauty and sweetness of Ginevra the Fair,
 for whose sake he likewise loved her twin sister, was so limed by
 Love that he could scarce think of aught else. So, feigning other
 <pb n="344"/>reasons, he consorted familiarly with Messer Neri, and did much
 frequent his garden, that he might see Ginevra.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00060025"/>And at length,
 being unable to endure his suffering any longer, and being minded,
 for that he could devise no other expedient, to despoil their father not
 only of the one but of the other damsel also, he discovered both his
 love and his project to Count Guy;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00060026"/>who, being a good man and true,
 thus made answer: <q>Sire, your tale causes me not a little astonishment,
 and that more especially because of your conversation from
 your childhood to this very day, I have, methinks, known more than
 any other man.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00060027"/>And as no such passion did I ever mark in you,
 even in your youth, when Love should more readily have fixed you
 with his fangs, as now I discern, when you are already on the
 verge of old age, 'tis to me so strange, so surprising that you
 should veritably love, that I deem it little short of a miracle.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00060028"/>And
 were it meet for me to reprove you, well wot I the language I should
 hold to you, considering that you are yet in arms in a realm but
 lately won, among a people as yet unknown to you, and wily and
 treacherous in the extreme, and that the gravest anxieties and
 matters of high policy engross your mind, so that you are not
 as yet able to sit you down, and nevertheless amid all these weighty
 concerns you have given harbourage to false, flattering Love.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00060029"/>This
 is not the wisdom of a great king, but the folly of a feather-pated
 boy. And moreover, what is far worse, you say that you are
 resolved to despoil this poor knight of his two daughters, whom,
 entertaining you in his house, and honouring you to the best of his
 power, he brought into your presence all but naked, testifying
 thereby, how great is his faith in you, and how assured he is that
 you are a king, and not a devouring wolf.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00060030"/>Have you so soon forgotten
 that 'twas Manfred's outrageous usage of his subjects that
 opened you the way into this realm? What treachery was he ever
 guilty of that better merited eternal torment, than 'twould be in you
 to wrest from one that honourably entreats you at once his hope and
 his consolation? What would be said of you if so you should do?
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00060031"/>Perchance you deem that 'twould suffice to say: 'I did it because
 he is a Ghibelline.' Is it then consistent with the justice of a king
 that those, be they who they may, who seek his protection, as this
 man has sought yours, should be entreated after this sort?  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00060032"/>King, I
 bid you remember that exceeding great as is your glory to have
 <pb n="345"/>vanquished Manfred, yet to conquer oneself is a still greater glory:
 wherefore you, to whom belongs the correction of others, see to it
 that you conquer yourself, and refrain this unruly passion; and let
 not such a blot mar the splendour of your achievements.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00060033"/>Sore stricken at heart by the Count's words, and the more
 mortified that he acknowledged their truth, the King heaved a
 fervent sigh or two, and then: <q>Count,</q> quoth he, <q>that enemy
 there is none, however mighty, but to the practised warrior is weak
 enough and easy to conquer in comparison of his own appetite, I
 make no doubt; but, great though the struggle will be and immeasurable
 the force that it demands, so shrewdly galled am I by
 your words, that not many days will have gone by before I shall
 without fail have done enough to shew you that I, that am the
 conqueror of others, am no less able to gain the victory over myself.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00060034"/>And indeed but a few days thereafter, the King, on his return to
 <placeName>Naples</placeName>, being minded at once to leave himself no excuse for dishonourable
 conduct, and to recompense the knight for his honourable
 entreatment of him, did, albeit 'twas hard for him to endow
 another with that which he had most ardently desired for himself,
 none the less resolve to bestow the two damsels in marriage, and that
 not as Messer Neri's daughters, but as his own.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00060035"/>Wherefore, Messer
 Neri consenting, he provided both with magnificent dowries, and
 gave Ginevra the Fair to Messer Maffeo da Palizzi, and Isotta the
 Blonde to Messer Guglielmo della Magna, noble knights and great
 barons both; which done, sad at heart beyond measure, he betook
 him to <placeName>Apulia</placeName>, and by incessant travail did so mortify his vehement
 appetite that he snapped and broke in pieces the fetters of Love, and
 for the rest of his days was no more vexed by such passion.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00060036"/>Perchance there will be those who say that 'tis but a trifle for
 a king to bestow two girls in marriage; nor shall I dispute it: but
 say we that a king in love bestowed in marriage her whom he loved,
 neither having taken nor taking, of his love, leaf or flower or fruit;
 then this I say was a feat great indeed, nay, as great as might be.</p><p>After such a sort then did this magnificent King, at once
 generously rewarding the noble knight, commendably honouring
 the damsels that he loved, and stoutly subduing himself.</p></div><pb n="346"/><!--***********************************Novella 7*********************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov1007"><head>Novel VII</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070001"/><!--(i)-->King Pedro, being apprised of the fervent love borne him

 at <placeName>Palermo</placeName> one of our Florentines, that was an apothecary, Bernardo
 Puccini by name, a man of great wealth, that by his lady had an
 only and exceeding fair daughter, then of marriageable age.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070005"/>Now
 King Pedro of Arragon, being instated in the sovereignty of the
 island, did at <placeName>Palermo</placeName> make with his barons marvellous celebration
 thereof; during which, as he tilted after the Catalan fashion, it
 befell that Bernardo's daughter, Lisa by name, being with other
 ladies at a window, did thence espy him in the course, whereat being
 prodigiously delighted, she regarded him again and again, and grew
 fervently enamoured of him;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070006"/>nor yet, when the festivities were
 ended, and she was at home with her father, was there aught she
 <pb n="347"/>could think of but this her exalted and aspiring love. In regard
 whereof that which most irked her was her sense of her low rank,
 which scarce permitted her any hope of a happy issue; but, for all
 that, give over her love for the King she would not; nor yet, for
 fear of worse to come, dared she discover it.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070007"/>The King, meanwhile,
 recking, witting nothing of the matter, her suffering waxed immeasurable,
 intolerable;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070008"/>and her love ever growing with ever fresh
 accessions of melancholy, the fair maiden, overborne at last, fell sick,
 and visibly day by day wasted like snow in sunlight.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070009"/>Distraught
 with grief thereat, her father and mother afforded her such succour
 as they might with words of good cheer, and counsel of physicians,
 and physic; but all to no purpose; for that she in despair of her
 love was resolved no more to live.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070010"/>Now her father assuring her that there was no whim of hers but
 should be gratified, the fancy took her that, if she might find apt
 means, she would, before she died, make her love and her resolve
 known to the King: wherefore one day she besought her father to
 cause Minuccio d'<placeName>Arezzo</placeName> to come to her;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070011"/>which Minuccio was a
 singer and musician of those days, reputed most skilful, and well seen
 of King Pedro. Bernardo, deeming that Lisa desired but to hear
 him play and sing a while, conveyed her message to him; and he,
 being an agreeable fellow, came to her forthwith, and after giving her
 some words of loving cheer, sweetly discoursed some airs upon his
 viol, and then sang her some songs; whereby, while he thought to
 comfort her, he did but add fire and flame to her love.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070012"/>Presently
 the girl said that she would fain say a few words to him in private,
 and when all else were withdrawn from the chamber: <q>Minuccio,</q>
 quoth she, <q>thee have I chosen, deeming thee most trusty, to be the
 keeper of my secret, relying upon thee in the first place never to
 betray it to a soul, and next to lend me in regard thereof such aid as
 thou mayst be able; and so I pray thee to do.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070013"/>Thou must know,
 then, Minuccio mine, that on the day when our lord King Pedro
 held the great festival in celebration of his triumph, I, seeing him
 tilt, was so smitten with love of him that thereof was kindled within
 my soul the fire which has brought me, as thou seest, to this pass;
 and knowing how ill it beseems me to love a king, and being unable,
 I say not to banish it from my heart, but so much as to bring it
 within bounds, and finding it exceeding grievous to bear, I have
 <pb n="348"/>made choice of death as the lesser pain; and die I shall.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070014"/>But should
 he wot not of my love before I die, sore disconsolate should I depart;
 and knowing not by whom more aptly than by thee I might give
 him to know this my frame, I am minded to entrust the communication
 thereof to thee; which office I entreat thee not to refuse, and
 having discharged it, to let me know, that dying thus consoled, I may
 depart this pain.</q> Which said, she silently wept.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070015"/>Marvelling at the loftiness of the girl's spirit and her desperate
 determination, Minuccio commiserated her not a little; and presently
 it occurred to him that there was a way in which he might honourably
 serve her: wherefore:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070016"/><q>Lisa,</q> quoth he, <q>my faith I plight
 thee, wherein thou mayst place sure confidence that I shall never
 play thee false, and lauding thy high emprise, to wit, the setting thine
 affections upon so great a king, I proffer thee mine aid, whereby,
 so thou wilt be of good cheer, I hope, and believe, that, before thou
 shalt see the third day from now go by, I shall have brought thee
 tidings which will be to thee for an exceeding great joy; and, not
 to lose time, I will set to work at once.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070017"/>And so Lisa, assuring
 him that she would be of good cheer, and plying him afresh with
 instant obsecrations, bade him Godspeed;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070018"/>and Minuccio, having
 taken leave of her, hied him to one Mico da <placeName>Siena</placeName>, a very expert
 rhymester of those days, who at his instant request made the ensuing
 song:</p><floatingText type="song"><body><lg><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070019"/><l>Hence hie thee, Love; and hasting to my King,</l><l>Give him to know what torment dire I bear,</l><l>How that to death I fare,</l><l>Still close, for fear, my passion harbouring.</l></lg><lg><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070020"/><l>Lo, Love, to thee with claspèd hands I turn,</l><l>And pray thee seek him where he tarrieth,</l><l>And tell him how I oft for him do yearn,</l><l>So sweetly he my heart enamoureth;</l><l>And of the fire, wherewith I throughly burn,</l><l>I think to die, but may the hour uneath</l><l>Say, when my grievous pain shall with my breath</l><l>Surcease; till when, neither may fear nor shame</l><l>The least abate the flame.</l><l>Ah! to his ears my woeful story bring.</l></lg><pb n="349"/><lg><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070021"/><l>Since of him I was first enamourèd,</l><l>Never hast thou, O Love, my fearful heart</l><l>With any such fond hope encouragèd,</l><l>As e'er its message to him to impart,</l><l>To him, my lord, that me so sore bested</l><l>Holds: dying thus, 'twere grievous to depart:</l><l>Perchance, were he to know my cruel smart,</l><l>'Twould not displease him; might I but make bold</l><l>My soul to him to unfold,</l><l>And shew him all my woeful languishing.</l></lg><lg><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070022"/><l>Love, since 'twas not thy will me to accord</l><l>Such boldness as that e'er unto my King</l><l>I may discover my sad heart's full hoard,</l><l>Or any word or sign thereof him bring:</l><l>This all my prayer to thee, O sweet my Lord:</l><l>Hie thee to him, and so him whispering</l><l>Mind of the day I saw him tourneying</l><l>With all his paladins environèd,</l><l>And grew enamourèd</l><l>Ev'n to my very heart's disrupturing.</l></lg></body></floatingText><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070023"/>Which words Minuccio forthwith set to music after a soft and
 plaintive fashion befitting their sense; and on the third day thereafter
 hied him to court, while King Pedro was yet at breakfast.
 And being bidden by the King to sing something to the accompaniment
 of his viol,  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070024"/>he gave them this song with such sweet concord of
 words and music that all the folk that were in the King's hall seemed,
 as it were, entranced, so intent and absorbed stood they to listen,
 and the King rather more than the rest.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070025"/>And when Minuccio had
 done singing, the King asked whence the song came, that, as far as
 he knew, he had never heard it before.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070026"/><q>Sire,</q> replied Minuccio,
 <q>'tis not yet three days since 'twas made, words and music alike.</q>
 And being asked by the King in regard of whom 'twas made:
 <q>I dare not,</q> quoth he, <q>discover such a secret save to you
 alone.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070027"/>Bent on hearing the story, the King, when the tables were cleared,
 took Minuccio into his privy chamber; and there Minuccio told
 him everything exactly as he had heard it from Lisa's lips. Whereby
 the King was much gratified, and lauded the maiden not a little, and
 <pb n="350"/>said that a girl of such high spirit merited considerate treatment, and
 bade Minuccio be his envoy to her, and comfort her, and tell her
 that without fail that very day at vespers he would come to visit her.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070028"/>Overjoyed to bear the girl such gladsome tidings, Minuccio tarried
 not, but hied him back to the girl with his viol, and being closeted
 with her, told her all that had passed, and then sang the song to the
 accompaniment of his viol.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070029"/>Whereby the girl was so cheered and
 delighted that forthwith there appeared most marked and manifest
 signs of the amendment of her health, while with passionate longing
 (albeit none in the house knew or divined it) she awaited the vesper
 hour, when she was to see her lord.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070030"/>Knowing the girl very well, and how fair she was, and pondering
 divers times on what Minuccio had told him, the King, being a prince
 of a liberal and kindly disposition, grew ever more compassionate.
 So, about vespers, he mounted his horse, and rode forth, as if for
 mere pleasure, and being come to the apothecary's house, demanded
 access to a very goodly garden that the apothecary had, and having
 dismounted, after a while enquired of Bernardo touching his
 daughter, and whether he had yet bestowed her in marriage.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070031"/><q>Sire,</q>
 replied Bernardo, <q>she is not yet married; and indeed she has been
 and still is very ill: howbeit since none she is wonderfully amended.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070032"/>The significance of which amendment being forthwith apprehended
 by the King: <q>In good faith,</q> quoth he, <q>'twere a pity so fair
 a creature were reft from the world so early; we would go in and
 visit her.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070033"/>And presently, attended only by two of his lords and
 Bernardo, he betook him to her chamber, where being entered,
 he drew nigh the bed, whereon the girl half reclined, half sate in
 eager expectation of his coming; and taking her by the hand:
 <q>Madonna,</q> quoth he, <q>what means this? A maiden like you
 should be the comfort of others, and you suffer yourself to languish.
 We would entreat you that for love of us you be of good cheer, so
 as speedily to recover your health.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070034"/>To feel the touch of his hand
 whom she loved above all else, the girl, albeit somewhat shamefast,
 was so enraptured that 'twas as if she was in Paradise; and as soon
 as she was able: <q>My lord,</q> she said, <q>'twas the endeavour, weak
 as I am, to sustain a most grievous burden that brought this sickness
 upon me; but 'twill not be long ere you will see me quit thereof,
 thanks to your courtesy.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070035"/>The hidden meaning of which words
 <pb n="351"/>was apprehended only by the King, who momently made more
 account of the girl, and again and again inly cursed Fortune, that had
 decreed that she should be the daughter of such a man. And yet a
 while he tarried with her, and comforted her, and so took his leave.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070036"/>Which gracious behaviour of the King was not a little commended,
 and accounted a signal honour to the apothecary and his daughter.</p><p>The girl, glad at heart as was ever lady of her lover, mended
 with reviving hope, and in a few days recovered her health, and
 therewith more than all her wonted beauty.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070037"/>Whereupon the King,
 having taken counsel with the Queen how to reward so great a love,
 got him one day to horse with a great company of his barons, and
 hied him to the apothecary's house; and being come into the garden,
 he sent for the apothecary and his daughter; and there, being joined
 by the Queen with not a few ladies, who received the girl into their
 company, they made such cheer as 'twas a wonder to see.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070038"/>And
 after a while the King and Queen having called Lisa to them, quoth
 the King: <q>Honourable damsel, by the great love that you have
 borne us we are moved greatly to honour you; and we trust that,
 for love of us, the honour that we design for you will be acceptable
 to you. Now 'tis thus we would honour you: to wit, that, seeing
 that you are of marriageable age, we would have you take for
 husband him that we shall give you; albeit 'tis none the less our
 purpose ever to call ourself your knight, demanding no other tribute
 of all your love but one sole kiss.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070039"/>Scarlet from brow to neck,
 the girl, making the King's pleasure her own, thus with a low
 voice replied: <q>My lord, very sure am I that, should it come to
 be known that I was grown enamoured of you, most folk would hold
 me for a fool, deeming, perchance, that I was out of my mind, and
 witless alike of my own rank and yours;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070040"/>but God, who alone reads
 the hearts of us mortals, knows that even then, when first I did
 affect you, I wist that you were the King, and I but the daughter of
 Bernardo the apothecary, and that to suffer my passion to soar so
 high did ill become me;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070041"/>but, as you know far better than I, none
 loves of set and discreet purpose, but only according to the dictates
 of impulse and fancy; which law my forces, albeit not seldom
 opposed, being powerless to withstand, I loved and still love and
 shall ever love you.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070042"/>But as no sooner knew I myself subjugated to
 your love, than I vowed to have ever no will but yours; therefore not
 <pb n="352"/>only am I compliant to take right gladly him whom you shall be
 pleased to give me for husband, thereby conferring upon me great
 honour and dignity; but if you should bid me tarry in the fire,
 delighted were I to obey, so thereby I might pleasure you.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070043"/>How
 far it beseems me to have you, my King, for my knight, you best
 know; and therefore I say nought thereof; nor will the kiss which
 you crave as your sole tribute of my love be granted you save by
 leave of my Lady the Queen.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070044"/>Natheless, may you have of this
 great graciousness that you and my Lady the Queen have shewn
 me, and which I may not requite, abundant recompense in the blessing
 and favour of God;</q> and so she was silent.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070045"/>The Queen was mightily delighted with the girl's answer, and
 deemed her as discreet as the King had said. The King then sent
 for the girl's father and mother, and being assured that his intention
 had their approval, summoned to his presence a young man, Perdicone
 by name, that was of gentle birth, but in poor circumstances, and
 put certain rings into his hand, and (he nowise gainsaying) wedded
 him to Lisa.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070046"/>Which done, besides jewels many and precious that
 he and the Queen gave the girl, he forthwith bestowed upon Perdicone
 two domains, right goodly and of ample revenues, to wit,
 Ceffalù and <placeName>Calatabellotta</placeName>, saying: <q>We give them to thee for thy
 wife's dowry; what we have in store for thee thou wilt learn hereafter.</q>
 Which said, he turned to the girl, and:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070047"/><q>Now,</q> quoth
 he, <q>we are minded to cull that fruit which is due to us of thy
 love;</q> and so, taking her head between both his hands, he kissed her
 brow.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070048"/>Wherefore, great was the joy of Perdicone, and the father
 and mother of Lisa, and Lisa herself, and mighty the cheer they
 made, and gaily did they celebrate the nuptials. And, as many
 affirm, right well did the King keep his promise to the girl; for that
 ever, while he lived, he called himself her knight, nor went to any
 passage of arms bearing other device than that which he had
 from her.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00070049"/>Now 'tis by doing after this sort that sovereigns win the hearts
 of their subjects, give others occasion of well-doing, and gain for
 themselves an imperishable renown. At which mark few or none in
 our times have bent the bow of their understanding, the more part
 of the princes having become but cruel tyrants.</p></div><pb n="353"/><!--***********************************Novella 8*********************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov1008"><head>Novel VIII</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080001"/><!--(i)-->Sophronia, albeit she deems herself wife to Gisippus, is

 it appertains to him to do, does well; but therein is no such matter of
 marvel, or occasion of extolling him to the skies, as in his deed, of
 whom, for that his power is slight, less is demanded.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080004"/>Wherefore, as
 you are so profuse of your words in exaltation of the fine deeds, as
 you deem them, of monarchs, I make no manner of doubt, but that the
 doings of our peers must seem to you yet more delectable and commendable,
 when they equal or surpass those of kings. Accordingly
 'tis a transaction, laudable and magnificent, that passed between two
 <pb n="354"/>citizens, who were friends, that I purpose to recount to you in my
 story.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080005"/>I say, then, that what time Octavianus Caesar, not as yet hight
 Augustus, but being in the office called Triumvirate, swayed the
 empire of <placeName>Rome</placeName>, there dwelt at <placeName>Rome</placeName> a gentleman, Publius Quintius
 Fulvus by name, who, having a son, Titus Quintius Fulvus, that
 was a very prodigy of wit, sent him to Athens to study philosophy,
 and to the best of his power commended him to a nobleman of that
 city, Chremes by name, who was his very old friend.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080006"/>Chremes
 lodged Titus in his own house with his son Gisippus, and placed
 both Titus and Gisippus under a philosopher named Aristippus, to
 learn of him his doctrine.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080007"/>And the two youths, thus keeping
 together, found each the other's conversation so congruous with his
 own, that there grew up between them a friendship so close and
 brotherly that 'twas never broken by aught but death; nor knew
 either rest or solace save when he was with the other.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080008"/>So, gifted
 alike with pre-eminent subtlety of wit, they entered on their studies,
 and with even pace and prodigious applause scaled together the
 glorious heights of philosophy. In which way of life, to the exceeding
 great delight of Chremes, who entreated Titus as no less his son
 than Gisippus, they continued for full three years.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080009"/>At the end
 whereof, it befell (after the common course of things mundane) that
 Chremes (being now aged) departed this life. Whom with equal
 grief they mourned as a common father; and the friends and kinsfolk
 of Chremes were alike at a loss to determine whether of the twain
 stood in need of the more consolation upon the bereavement.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080010"/>Some months afterward the friends and kinsfolk of Gisippus came
 to him and exhorted him, as did also Titus, to take a wife, and found
 him a maiden, wondrous fair, of one of the most noble houses of
 Athens, her name Sophronia, and her age about fifteen years.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080011"/>So a
 time was appointed for their nuptials, and one day, when 'twas near
 at hand, Gisippus bade Titus come see the maiden, whom as yet he
 had not seen; and they being come into her house, and she sitting
 betwixt them, Titus, as he were fain to observe with care the several
 charms of his friend's wife that was to be, surveyed her with the
 closest attention, and being delighted beyond measure with all that
 he saw, grew, as inly he extolled her charms to the skies, enamoured
 of her with a love as ardent, albeit he gave no sign of it, as ever lover
 <pb n="355"/>bore to lady. However, after they had tarried a while with her,
 they took their leave, and went home,  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080012"/>where Titus repaired to his
 chamber, and there gave himself over to solitary musing on the
 damsel's charms, and the longer he brooded, the more he burned for
 her. Whereon as he reflected, having heaved many a fervent sigh,
 thus he began to commune with himself:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080013"/>Ah! woe worth thy
 life, Titus! Whom makest thou the mistress of thy soul, thy
 love, thy hope? Knowest thou not that by reason as well of thy
 honourable entreatment by Chremes and his kin as of the whole-hearted
 friendship that is between thee and Gisippus, it behoves thee
 to have his betrothed in even such pious regard as if she were thy
 sister? Whither art thou suffering beguiling love, delusive hope, to
 hurry thee?  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080014"/>Open the eyes of thine understanding, and see thyself,
 wretched man, as thou art; obey the dictates of thy reason, refrain thy
 carnal appetite, control thine inordinate desires, and give thy thoughts
 another bent; join battle with thy lust at the outset, and conquer
 thyself while there is yet time.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080015"/>This which thou wouldst have is
 not meet, is not seemly: this which thou art minded to ensue, thou
 wouldst rather, though thou wert, as thou art not, sure of its attainment,
 eschew, hadst thou but the respect thou shouldst have, for the
 claims of true friendship. So, then, Titus, what wilt thou do?
 What but abandon this unseemly love, if thou wouldst do as it
 behoves thee?</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080016"/>But then, as he remembered Sophronia, his thoughts took the
 contrary direction, and he recanted all he had said, musing on this
 wise: The laws of Love are of force above all others; they abrogate
 not only the law of human friendship, but the law Divine
 itself. How many times ere now has father loved daughter, brother
 sister, step-mother step-son? aberrations far more notable than that a
 friend should love his friend's wife, which has happened a thousand
 times.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080017"/>Besides which, I am young, and youth is altogether subject
 to the laws of Love. Love's pleasure, then, should be mine. The
 seemly is for folk of riper years. 'Tis not in my power to will aught
 save that which Love wills.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080018"/>So beauteous is this damsel that there
 is none but should love her; and if I love her, who am young, who
 can justly censure me? I love her not because she is the affianced
 of Gisippus; no matter whose she was, I should love her all the
 same.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080019"/>Herein is Fortune to blame, that gave her to my friend,
 <pb n="356"/>Gisippus, rather than to another. And if she is worthy of love, as
 for beauty she is, Gisippus, if he should come to know that I love
 her, ought to be less jealous than another.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080020"/>Then, scorning himself that he should indulge such thoughts, he
 relapsed into the opposing mood, albeit not to abide there, but ever
 veering to and fro, he spent not only the whole of that day and the
 ensuing night, but many others; insomuch that, being able neither
 to eat nor to sleep, he grew so weak that he was fain to take to his
 bed.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080021"/>Gisippus, who had marked his moodiness for some days, and
 now saw that he was fairly sick, was much distressed; and with
 sedulous care, never quitting his side, he tended, and strove as best
 he might to comfort, him, not seldom and most earnestly demanding
 to know of him the cause of his melancholy and his sickness. Many
 were the subterfuges to which Titus resorted; but, as Gisippus was
 not to be put off with his fables, finding himself hard pressed by him,
 with sighs and sobs he made answer on this wise:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080022"/><q>Gisippus, had
 such been the will of the Gods, I were fain rather to die than to
 live, seeing that Fortune has brought me to a strait in which needs
 must my virtue be put to the ordeal, and, to my most grievous
 shame, 'tis found wanting: whereof I confidently expect my due
 reward, to wit, death, which will be more welcome to me than to
 live, haunted ever by the memory of my baseness, which, as there is
 nought that from thee I either should or can conceal, I, not without
 burning shame, will discover to thee.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080023"/>And so he recounted the
 whole story from first to last, the occasion of his melancholy, its
 several moods, their conflict, and with which of them the victory
 rested, averring that he was dying of love for Sophronia, and that,
 knowing how ill such love beseemed him, he had, for penance, elected
 to die, and deemed the end was now not far off.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080024"/>Gisippus, hearing
 his words and seeing his tears, for a while knew not what to say,
 being himself smitten with the damsel's charms, albeit in a less degree
 than Titus; but ere long he made up his mind that Sophronia must
 be less dear to him than his friend's life.</p><p>And so, moved to tears by his friend's tears:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080025"/><q>Titus,</q> quoth
 he between his sobs, <q>but that thou art in need of comfort, I should
 reproach thee, that thou hast offended against our friendship in that
 thou hast so long kept close from me this most distressful passion;
 and albeit thou didst deem it unseemly, yet unseemly things should
 <pb n="357"/>no more than things seemly be withheld from a friend, for that, as a
 friend rejoices with his friend in things seemly, so he does his endeavour
 to wean his friend from things unseemly: but enough of this
 for the nonce: I pass to that which, I wot, is of greater moment.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080026"/>If
 thou ardently lovest Sophronia, my affianced, so far from marvelling
 thereat, I should greatly marvel were it not so, knowing how fair
 she is, and how noble is thy soul, and thus the apter to be swayed by
 passion, the more excelling is she by whom thou art charmed.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080027"/>And
 the juster the cause thou hast to love Sophronia, the greater is the
 injustice with which thou complainest of Fortune (albeit thou dost it
 not in so many words) for giving her to me, as if thy love of her had
 been seemly, had she belonged to any other but me;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080028"/>whereas, if thou
 art still the wise man thou wast wont to be, thou must know that to
 none could Fortune have assigned her, with such good cause for thee
 to thank her, as to me. Had any other had her, albeit thy love had
 been seemly, he had loved her as his own, rather than as thine;
 which, if thou deem me even such a friend to thee as I am, thou wilt
 not apprehend from me, seeing that I mind me not that, since we
 were friends, I had ever aught that was not as much thine as mine.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080029"/>And so should I entreat thee herein as in all other matters, were the
 affair gone so far that nought else were possible; but as it is, I can
 make thee sole possessor of her; and so I mean to do; for I know
 not what cause thou shouldst have to prize my friendship, if, where
 in seemly sort it might be done, I knew not how to surrender my
 will to thine.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080030"/>'Tis true that Sophronia is my betrothed, and that I
 loved her much, and had great cheer in expectation of the nuptials:
 but as thou, being much more discerning than I, dost more fervently
 affect this rare prize, rest assured that she will enter my chamber not
 mine but thine.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080031"/>Wherefore, away with thy moodiness, banish thy
 melancholy, recover thy lost health, thy heartiness and jollity, and
 gladsomely, even from this very hour, anticipate the guerdon of thy
 love, a love worthier far than mine.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080032"/>Delightful as was the prospect with which hope flattered Titus,
 as he heard Gisippus thus speak, no less was the shame with which
 right reason affected him, admonishing him that the greater was the
 liberality of Gisippus, the less it would become him to profit thereby.
 Wherefore, still weeping, he thus constrained himself to make
 answer:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080033"/><q>Gisippus, thy generous and true friendship leaves me in
 <pb n="358"/>no doubt as to the manner in which it becomes me to act. God forefend
 that her, whom, as to the more worthy, He has given to thee, I
 should ever accept of thee for mine. Had He seen fit that she should
 be mine, far be it from thee or any other to suppose that He would
 ever have awarded her to thee.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080034"/>Renounce not, then, that which thy
 choice and wise counsel and His gift have made thine, and leave me,
 to whom, as unworthy, He has appointed no such happiness, to
 waste my life in tears; for either I shall conquer my grief, which
 will be grateful to thee, or it will conquer me, and so I shall be quit
 of my pain.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080035"/>Quoth then Gisippus: <q>If our friendship, Titus, is
 of such a sort as may entitle me to enforce thee to ensue behests of
 mine, or as may induce thee of thine own free will to ensue the
 same, such is the use to which, most of all, I am minded to put it;
 and if thou lend not considerate ear unto my prayers, I shall by
 force, that force which is lawful in the interest of a friend, make
 Sophronia thine.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080036"/>I know the might of Love, how redoubtable it is,
 and how, not once only, but oftentimes, it has brought ill-starred lovers
 to a miserable death; and thee I see so hard bested that turn back
 thou mightst not, nor get the better of thy grief, but holding on thy
 course, must succumb, and perish; and without doubt I should
 speedily follow thee.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080037"/>And so, had I no other cause to love thee, thy
 life is precious to me in that my own is bound up with it. Sophronia,
 then, shall be thine; for thou wouldst not lightly find another so
 much to thy mind, and I shall readily find another to love, and so
 shall content both thee and me.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080038"/>In which matter, peradventure, I
 might not be so liberal, were wives so scarce or hard to find as are
 friends; wherefore, as 'tis so easy a matter for me to find another
 wife, I had liefer--I say not lose her, for in giving her to thee lose
 her I shall not, but only transfer her to one that is my <!--(i)-->alter ego<!--(/i)-->,
 and
 that to her advantage--I had liefer, I say, transfer her to thee than
 lose thee.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080039"/>And so, if aught my prayers avail with thee, I entreat thee
 extricate thyself from this thy woeful plight, and comfort at once
 thyself and me, and in good hope, address thyself to pluck that boon
 which thy fervent love craves of her for whom thou yearnest.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080040"/>Still scrupling, for shame, to consent that Sophronia should become
 his wife, Titus remained yet a while inexorable; but, yielding at
 last to the solicitations of Love, reinforced by the exhortations of
 Gisippus, thus he made answer: <q>Lo now, Gisippus, I know not
 <pb n="359"/>how to call it, whether 'tis more thy pleasure than mine, this which
 I do, seeing that 'tis as thy pleasure that thou so earnestly entreatest
 me to do it; but, as thy liberality is such that my shame, though
 becoming, may not withstand it, I will even do it.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080041"/>But of this rest
 assured, that I do so, witting well that I receive from thee, not only
 the lady I love, but with her my very life. And, Fate permitting,
 may the Gods grant me to make thee such honourable and goodly
 requital as may shew thee how sensible I am of the boon, which
 thou, more compassionate of me than I am of myself, conferrest on
 me.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080042"/>Quoth then Gisippus: <q>Now, for the giving effect to our
 purpose, methinks, Titus, we should proceed on this wise. Thou
 knowest that Sophronia, by treaty at length concluded between my
 family and hers, is become my betrothed: were I now to say that
 she should not be my wife, great indeed were the scandal that would
 come thereof, and I should affront both her family and mine own;
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080043"/>whereof, indeed, I should make no account, so it gave me to see her
 become thine; but I fear that, were I to give her up at this juncture,
 her family would forthwith bestow her upon another, perchance,
 than thee, and so we should both be losers.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080044"/>Wherefore
 methinks that, so thou approve, I were best to complete what I have
 begun, bring her home as my wife, and celebrate the nuptials, and
 thereafter we can arrange that thou lie with her, privily, as thy wife.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080045"/>Then, time and occasion serving, we will disclose the whole affair,
 and if they are satisfied, well and good; if not, 'twill be done all the
 same, and as it cannot be undone, they must perforce make the best
 of it.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080046"/>Which counsel being approved by Titus, Gisippus brought the
 lady home as his wife, Titus being now recovered, and quite himself
 again; and when they had made great cheer, and night was come,
 the ladies, having bedded the bride, took their departure.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080047"/>Now the
 chambers of Titus and Gisippus were contiguous, and one might
 pass from one into the other: Gisippus, therefore, being come into
 his room, extinguished every ray of light, and stole into that of
 Titus, and bade him go get him to bed with his lady.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080048"/>Whereat Titus
 gave way to shame, and would have changed his mind, and refused
 to go in; but Gisippus, no less zealous at heart than in words to
 serve his friend, after no small contention prevailed on him to go
 thither. Now no sooner was Titus abed with the lady, than, taking
 <pb n="360"/>her in his arms, he, as if jestingly, asked in a low tone whether she
 were minded to be his wife.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080049"/>She, taking him to be Gisippus,
 answered, yes; whereupon he set a fair and costly ring on her
 finger, saying: <q>And I am minded to be thy husband.</q> And
 having presently consummated the marriage, he long and amorously
 disported him with her, neither she, nor any other, being ever aware
 that another than Gisippus lay with her.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080050"/>Now Titus and Sophronia being after this sort wedded, Publius,
 the father of Titus, departed this life. For which cause Titus was
 bidden by letter to return forthwith to <placeName>Rome</placeName> to see to his affairs;
 wherefore he took counsel with Gisippus how he might take
 Sophronia thither with him; which might not well be done without
 giving her to know how matters stood.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080051"/>Whereof, accordingly, one
 day, having called her into the chamber, they fully apprised her,
 Titus for her better assurance bringing to her recollection not a little
 of what had passed between them.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080052"/>Whereat she, after glancing from
 one to the other somewhat disdainfully, burst into a flood of tears,
 and reproached Gisippus that he had so deluded her; and forthwith,
 saying nought of the matter to any there, she hied her forth of
 Gisippus' house and home to her father, to whom and her mother
 she recounted the deceit which Gisippus had practised upon them as
 upon her, averring that she was the wife not of Gisippus, as they
 supposed, but of Titus.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080053"/>Whereby her father was aggrieved exceedingly,
 and prolonged and grave complaint was made thereof by him
 and his own and Gisippus' families, and there was not a little parleying,
 and a world of pother. Gisippus earned the hatred of both his own and
 Sophronia's kin, and all agreed that he merited not only censure but
 severe punishment. He, however, averred that he had done a thing
 seemly, and that Sophronia's kinsfolk owed him thanks for giving her
 in marriage to one better than himself.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080054"/>All which Titus witnessed with great suffering, and witting that
 'twas the way of the Greeks to launch forth in high words and
 menaces, and refrain not until they should meet with one that
 answered them, whereupon they were wont to grow not only
 humble but even abject, was at length minded that their clavers
 should no longer pass unanswered;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080055"/>and, as with his Roman temper he
 united Athenian subtlety, he cleverly contrived to bring the kinsfolk,
 as well of Gisippus as of Sophronia, together in a temple,
 <pb n="361"/>where, being entered, attended only by Gisippus, thus (they being
 intent to hear) he harangued them:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080056"/><q>'Tis the opinion of not a
 few philosophers that whatsoever mortals do is ordained by the providence
 of the immortal Gods; for which cause some would have it
 that nought either is, or ever shall be, done, save of necessity, albeit
 others there are that restrict this necessity to that which is already
 done.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080057"/>Regard we but these opinions with some little attention, and
 we shall very plainly perceive that to censure that which cannot be
 undone is nought else but to be minded to shew oneself wiser than
 the Gods; by whom we must suppose that we and our affairs are
 swayed and governed with uniform and unerring wisdom. Whereby
 you may very readily understand how vain and foolish a presumption
 it is to pass judgment on their doings, and what manner and might
 of chains they need who suffer themselves to be transported to such
 excess of daring.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080058"/>Among whom, in my judgment, you must one
 and all be numbered, if 'tis true, what I hear, to wit, that you have
 complained and do continue to complain that Sophronia, albeit you
 gave her to Gisippus, is, nevertheless, become my wife; not considering
 that 'twas ordained from all eternity that she should become, not
 the wife of Gisippus, but mine, as the fact does now declare.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080059"/><q>But, for that discourse of the secret providence and purposes of
 the Gods seems to many a matter hard and scarce to be understood,
 I am willing to assume that they meddle in no wise with our concerns,
 and to descend to the region of human counsels; in speaking
 whereof I must needs do two things quite at variance with my wont,
 to wit, in some degree praise myself and censure or vilify another.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080060"/>But, as in either case I mean not to deviate from the truth, and 'tis
 what the occasion demands, I shall not fail so to do.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080061"/>With bitter
 upbraidings, animated rather by rage than by reason, you cease not
 to murmur, nay, to cry out, against Gisippus, and to harass him with
 your abuse, and hold him condemned, for that her, whom you saw
 fit to give him, he has seen fit to give me, to wife; wherein I deem
 him worthy of the highest commendation, and that for two reasons,
 first, because he has done the office of a friend, and secondly, because
 he has done more wisely than you did.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080062"/>After what sort the sacred
 laws of friendship prescribe that friend shall entreat friend, 'tis not to
 my present purpose to declare; 'twill suffice to remind you that the
 tie of friendship should be more binding than that of blood, or
 <pb n="362"/>kinship; seeing that our friends are of our own choosing, whereas our
 kinsfolk are appointed us by Fortune;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080063"/>wherefore, if my life was more
 to Gisippus than your goodwill, since I am, as I hold myself, his
 friend, can any wonder thereat?</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080064"/><q>But pass we to my second reason; in the exposition whereof I
 must needs with yet more cogency prove to you that he has been
 wiser than you, seeing that, methinks, you wot nought of the providence
 of the Gods, and still less of the consequences of friendship.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080065"/>I
 say then, that, as 'twas your premeditated and deliberate choice that
 gave Sophronia to this young philosopher Gisippus, so 'twas his that
 gave her to another young philosopher. 'Twas your counsel that
 gave her to an Athenian; 'twas his that gave her to a Roman:
 'twas your counsel that gave her to a man of gentle birth; 'twas his
 that gave her to one of birth yet gentler: wealthy was he to whom
 your counsel gave her, most wealthy he to whom his counsel gave
 her. Not only did he to whom your counsel gave her, love her not,
 but he scarce knew her, whereas 'twas to one that loved her beyond
 all other blessings, nay, more dearly than his own life, that his
 counsel gave her.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080066"/>And to the end that it may appear more plainly
 that 'tis even as I say, and Gisippus' counsel more to be commended
 than yours, let us examine it point by point. That I, like Gisippus,
 am young and a philosopher, my countenance and my pursuits may,
 without making more words about the matter, sufficiently attest.
 We are also of the same age, and have ever kept pace together in
 our studies.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080067"/>Now true it is that he is an Athenian, and I am a
 Roman. But, as touching the comparative glory of the cities,
 should the matter be mooted, I say that I am of a free city, and he
 of a city tributary; that I am of a city that is mistress of all the
 world, and he of one that is subject to mine; that I am of a city
 that flourishes mightily in arms, in empire, and in arts; whereas he
 cannot boast his city as famous save in arts.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080068"/><q>Moreover, albeit you see me here in the guise of a most humble
 scholar, I am not born of the dregs of the populace of <placeName>Rome</placeName>. My
 halls and the public places of <placeName>Rome</placeName> are full of the antique effigies of
 my forefathers, and the annals of <placeName>Rome</placeName> abound with the records of
 triumphs led by the Quintii to the Roman <placeName>Capitol</placeName>; and so far from
 age having withered it, to-day, yet more abundantly than ever of
 yore, flourishes the glory of our name.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080069"/>Of my wealth I forbear, for
 <pb n="363"/>shame, to speak, being mindful that honest poverty is the time-honoured
 and richest inheritance of the noble citizens of <placeName>Rome</placeName>;
 but, allowing for the nonce the opinion of the vulgar, which holds
 poverty in disrepute, and highly appraises wealth, I, albeit I never
 sought it, yet, as the favoured of Fortune, have abundant store
 thereof.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080070"/>Now well I wot that, Gisippus being of your own city,
 you justly prized and prize an alliance with him; but not a whit
 less should you prize an alliance with me at <placeName>Rome</placeName>, considering that
 there you will have in me an excellent host, and a patron apt, zealous
 and potent to serve you as well in matters of public interest as in
 your private concerns.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080071"/>Who, then, dismissing all bias from his
 mind, and judging with impartial reason, would deem your counsel
 more commendable than that of Gisippus? Assuredly none.
 Sophronia, then, being married to Titus Quintius Fulvus, a citizen
 of <placeName>Rome</placeName>, of an ancient and illustrious house, and wealthy, and a
 friend of Gisippus, whoso takes umbrage or offence thereat, does
 that which it behoves him not to do, and knows not what he does.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080072"/><q>Perchance some will say that their complaint is not that
 Sophronia is the wife of Titus, but that she became his wife after
 such a sort, to wit, privily, by theft, neither friend nor any of her
 kin witting aught thereof; but herein is no matter of marvel, no
 prodigy as yet unheard-of.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080073"/>I need not instance those who before
 now have taken to them husbands in defiance of their fathers' will,
 or have eloped with their lovers and been their mistresses before they
 were their wives, or of whose marriages no word has been spoken,
 until their pregnancy or parturition published them to the world,
 and necessity sanctioned the fact: nought of this has happened in
 the case of Sophronia; on the contrary, 'twas in proper form, and in
 meet and seemly sort, that Gisippus gave her to Titus.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080074"/>And others,
 peradventure, will say that 'twas by one to whom such office belonged
 not that she was bestowed in marriage. Nay, but this is but
 vain and womanish querulousness, and comes of scant consideration.
 Know we not, then, that Fortune varies according to circumstances
 her methods and her means of disposing events to their predetermined
 ends?  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080075"/>What matters it to me, if it be a cobbler, rather than
 a philosopher, that Fortune has ordained to compass something for
 me, whether privily or overtly, so only the result is as it should be?
 I ought, indeed, to take order, if the cobbler be indiscreet, that he
 <pb n="364"/>meddle no more in affairs of mine, but, at the same time, I ought to
 thank him for what he has done.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080076"/>If Gisippus has duly bestowed
 Sophronia in marriage, it is gratuitous folly to find fault with the
 manner and the person. If you mistrust his judgment, have a care
 that it be not in his power to do the like again, but thank him
 for this turn.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080077"/><q>Natheless, you are to know that I used no cunning practice or
 deceit to sully in any degree the fair fame of your house in the
 person of Sophronia;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080078"/>and, albeit I took her privily to wife, I came
 not as a ravisher to despoil her of her virginity, nor in any hostile
 sort was I minded to make her mine on dishonourable terms, and
 spurn your alliance; but, being fervently enamoured of her bewitching
 beauty and her noble qualities, I wist well that, should I
 make suit for her with those formalities which you, perchance, will
 say were due, then, for the great love you bear her, and for fear lest I
 should take her away with me to <placeName>Rome</placeName>, I might not hope to have
 her.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080079"/>Accordingly I made use of the secret practice which is now
 manifest to you, and brought Gisippus to consent in my interest to
 that whereto he was averse;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080080"/>and thereafter, ardently though I loved
 her, I sought not to commingle with her as a lover, but as a husband,
 nor closed with her, until, as she herself by her true witness
 may assure you, I had with apt words and with the ring made her
 my lawful wife, asking her if she would have me to husband, whereto
 she answered, yes. Wherein if she seem to have been tricked, 'tis
 not I that am to blame, but she, for that she asked me not who I was.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080081"/><q>This, then, is the great wrong, sin, crime, whereof for love and
 friendship's sake Gisippus and I are guilty, that Sophronia is privily
 become the wife of Titus Quintius: 'tis for this that you harass him
 with your menaces and hostile machinations.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080082"/>What more would
 you do, had he given her to a villein, to a caitiff, to a slave? Where
 would you find fetters, dungeons, crosses adequate to your vengeance?
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080083"/>But enough of this at present: an event, which I did not
 expect, has now happened; my father is dead; and I must needs
 return to <placeName>Rome</placeName>; wherefore, being fain to take Sophronia with me,
 I have discovered to you that which otherwise I had, perchance, still
 kept close. Whereto, if you are wise, you will gladly reconcile
 yourselves; for that, if I had been minded to play you false, or put
 an affront upon you, I might have scornfully abandoned her to you;
 <pb n="365"/>but God forefend that such baseness be ever harboured in a Roman
 breast.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080084"/>Sophronia, then, by the will of the Gods, by force of law,
 and by my own love-taught astuteness, is mine. The which it would
 seem that you, deeming yourselves, peradventure, wiser than the
 Gods, or the rest of mankind, do foolishly set at nought, and that in
 two ways alike most offensive to me; inasmuch as you both withhold
 from me Sophronia, in whom right, as against me, you have
 none, and also entreat as your enemy Gisippus, to whom you are
 rightfully bounden.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080085"/>The folly whereof I purpose not at present
 fully to expound to you, but in friendly sort to counsel you to abate
 your wrath and abandon all your schemes of vengeance, and restore
 Sophronia to me, that I may part from you on terms of amity and
 alliance, and so abide:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080086"/>but of this rest assured, that whether this,
 which is done, like you or not, if you are minded to contravene it, I
 shall take Gisippus hence with me, and once arrived in <placeName>Rome</placeName>, shall
 in your despite find means to recover her who is lawfully mine, and
 pursuing you with unremitting enmity, will apprise you by experience
 of the full measure and effect of a Roman's wrath.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080087"/>Having so said, Titus started to his feet, his countenance distorted
 by anger, and took Gisippus by the hand, and with manifest
 contempt for all the rest, shaking his head at them and threatening
 them, led him out of the temple.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080088"/>They that remained in the
 temple, being partly persuaded by his arguments to accept his
 alliance and friendship, partly terrified by his last words, resolved by
 common consent that 'twas better to have the alliance of Titus, as
 they had lost that of Gisippus, than to add to that loss the enmity of
 Titus.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080089"/>Wherefore they followed Titus, and having come up with
 him, told him that they were well pleased that Sophronia should be
 his, and that they should prize his alliance and the friendship of dear
 Gisippus; and having ratified this treaty of amity and alliance with
 mutual cheer, they departed and sent Sophronia to Titus. Sophronia,
 discreetly making a virtue of necessity, transferred forthwith to Titus
 the love she had borne Gisippus, and being come with Titus to <placeName>Rome</placeName>,
 was there received with no small honour.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080090"/>Gisippus tarried in Athens,
 held in little account by well-nigh all the citizens, and being involved
 in certain of their broils, was, not long afterwards, with all his
 household,
 banished the city, poor, nay, destitute, and condemned to perpetual
 exile.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080091"/>Thus hard bested, and at length reduced to mendicancy,
 <pb n="366"/>he made his way, so as least discomfortably he might, to <placeName>Rome</placeName>,
 being minded to see whether Titus would remember him: and
 there, learning that Titus lived, and was much affected by all the
 Romans, and having found out his house, he took his stand in front
 of it, and watched until Titus came by;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080092"/>to whom, for shame of the
 sorry trim that he was in, he ventured no word, but did his endeavour
 that he might be seen of him, hoping that Titus might recognize
 him, and call him by his name: but Titus passing on, Gisippus
 deeming that he had seen and avoided him, and calling to mind that
 which aforetime he had done for him, went away wroth and
 desperate.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080093"/>And fasting and penniless, and--for 'twas now night--knowing
 not whither he went, and yearning above all for death, he
 wandered by chance to a spot, which, albeit 'twas within the city,
 had much of the aspect of a wilderness, and espying a spacious
 grotto, he took shelter there for the night; and worn out at last with
 grief, on the bare ground, wretchedly clad as he was, he fell asleep.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080094"/>Now two men that had that night gone out a thieving, having
 committed the theft, came towards morning to the grotto, and there
 quarrelled, and the stronger slew the other, and took himself off.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080095"/>Aroused by the noise, Gisippus witnessed the murder, and deeming
 that he had now the means of compassing, without suicide, the death
 for which he so much longed, budged not a jot, but stayed there,
 until the serjeants of the court, which had already got wind of the
 affair, came on the scene, and laid violent hands upon him, and led
 him away.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080096"/>Being examined, he confessed that he had slain the man,
 and had then been unable to make his escape from the grotto.
 Wherefore the praetor, Marcus Varro by name, sentenced him to
 death by crucifixion, as was then the custom.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080097"/>But Titus, who
 happened at that moment to come into the praetorium, being told
 the crime for which he was condemned, and scanning the poor
 wretch's face, presently recognized him for Gisippus, and marvelled
 how he should come to be there, and in such a woeful plight. And
 most ardently desiring to succour him, nor seeing other way to save
 his life except to exonerate him by accusing himself, he straightway
 stepped forward, and said with a loud voice:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080098"/><q>Marcus Varro, call
 back the poor man on whom thou hast passed sentence, for he is
 innocent. 'Tis enough that I have incurred the wrath of the Gods
 by one deed of violence, to wit, the murder of him whom your
 <pb n="367"/>serjeants found dead this morning, without aggravating my offence
 by the death of another innocent man.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080099"/>Perplexed, and vexed that he
 should have been heard by all in the praetorium, but unable honourably
 to avoid compliance with that which the laws enjoined, Varro
 had Gisippus brought back, and in presence of Titus said to him:
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080100"/><q>How camest thou to be so mad as, though no constraint was put
 upon thee, to confess a deed thou never didst, thy life being at stake?
 Thou saidst that 'twas thou by whom the man was slain last night,
 and now comes this other, and says that 'twas not thou but he that
 slew him.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080101"/>Gisippus looked, and seeing Titus, wist well that, being
 grateful for the service rendered by him in the past, Titus was now
 minded to save his life at the cost of his own: wherefore, affected to
 tears, he said: <q>Nay but, Varro, in very sooth I slew him, and 'tis
 now too late, this tender solicitude of Titus for my deliverance.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080102"/>But on his part: <q>Praetor,</q> quoth Titus, <q>thou seest this man is
 a stranger, and was found unarmed beside the murdered man; thou
 canst not doubt that he was fain of death for very wretchedness:
 wherefore discharge him, and let punishment light on me who have
 merited it.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080103"/>Marvelling at the importunity of both, Varro readily surmised
 that neither was guilty. And while he was casting about how he
 might acquit them, lo, in came a young man, one Publius Ambustus,
 a desperate character, and known to all the Romans for an arrant
 thief. He it was that had verily committed the murder,  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080104"/>and witting
 both the men to be innocent of that of which each accused himself, so
 sore at heart was he by reason of their innocence, that, overborne by
 an exceeding great compassion, he presented himself before Varro,
 and:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080105"/><q>Praetor,</q> quoth he, <q>'tis destiny draws me hither to loose
 the knot of these men's contention; and some God within me leaves
 me no peace of his whips and stings, until I discover my offence:
 wherefore know that neither of these men is guilty of that of which
 each accuses himself.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080106"/>'Tis verily I that slew the man this morning
 about daybreak; and before I slew him, while I was sharing our
 plunder with him, I espied this poor fellow asleep there. Nought
 need I say to clear Titus: the general bruit of his illustrious renown
 attests that he is not a man of such a sort. Discharge him, therefore,
 and exact from me the penalty prescribed by the laws.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080107"/>The affair had by this time come to the ears of Octavianus, who
 <pb n="368"/>caused all three to be brought before him, and demanded to know
 the causes by which they had been severally moved to accuse themselves;
 and, each having told his story, Octavianus released the two
 by reason of their innocence, and the third for love of them.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080108"/>Titus
 took Gisippus home, having first chidden him not a little for his
 faint-heartedness and diffidence, and there, Sophronia receiving him as
 a brother, did him marvellous cheer;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080109"/>and having comforted him a
 while, and arrayed him in apparel befitting his worth and birth, he
 first shared with him all his substance, and then gave him his sister,
 a young damsel named <persName>Fulvia</persName>, to wife, and said to him: <q>Choose
 now, Gisippus, whether thou wilt tarry here with me, or go back
 to <placeName>Achaia</placeName> with all that I have given thee.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080110"/>Partly perforce of his banishment from his city, partly for that
 the sweet friendship of Titus was justly dear to him, Gisippus
 consented to become a Roman. And so, long and happily they
 lived together at <placeName>Rome</placeName>, Gisippus with his <persName>Fulvia</persName>, and Titus with
 his Sophronia, in the same house, growing, if possible, greater friends
 day by day.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080111"/>Exceeding sacred then, is friendship, and worthy not only to be
 had in veneration, but to be extolled with never-ending praise, as the
 most dutiful mother of magnificence and seemliness, sister of gratitude
 and charity, and foe to enmity and avarice; ever, without waiting
 to be asked, ready to do as generously by another as she would be
 done by herself.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080112"/>Rarely indeed is it to-day that twain are found, in
 whom her most holy fruits are manifest; for which is most shamefully
 answerable the covetousness of mankind, which, regarding only
 private interest, has banished friendship beyond earth's farthest bourne,
 there to abide in perpetual exile.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080113"/>How should love, or wealth, or
 kinship, how should aught but friendship have so quickened the soul
 of Gisippus that the tears and sighs of Titus should incline his heart
 to cede to him the fair and gracious lady that was his betrothed and
 his beloved?  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080114"/>Laws, menaces, terror! How should these, how should
 aught but friendship, have withheld Gisippus, in lonely places, in
 hidden retreats, in his own bed, from enfolding (not perchance unsolicited
 by her) the fair damsel within his youthful embrace?
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080115"/>Honours, rewards, gains! Would Gisippus for these, would he for
 aught but friendship, have made nothing of the loss of kindred--his
 own and Sophronia's--have made nothing of the injurious murmurs
 <pb n="369"/>of the populace, have made nothing of mocks and scorns, so only
 he might content his friend?  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080116"/>And on the other hand, for what
 other cause than friendship had Titus, when he might decently have
 feigned not to see, have striven with the utmost zeal to compass his
 own death, and set himself upon the cross in Gisippus' stead?  
[*** missing sentence: please see Italian <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080117"/> ***] 
<milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080118"/>And
 what but friendship had left no place for suspicion in the soul of
 Titus, and filled it with a most fervent desire to give his sister to
 Gisippus, albeit he saw him to be reduced to extreme penury
 and destitution?  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00080119"/>But so it is that men covet hosts of acquaintance,
 troops of kinsfolk, offspring in plenty; and the number of their
 dependants increases with their wealth; and they reflect not that
 there is none of these, be he who he may, but will be more apprehensive
 of the least peril threatening himself than cumbered to avert
 a great peril from his lord or kinsman, whereas between friends we
 know 'tis quite contrariwise.</p></div><pb n="370"/><!--***********************************Novella 9*********************************--><div type="novella" corresp="nov1009"><head>Novel IX</head><argument><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090001"/><!--(i)-->Saladin, in guise of a merchant, is honourably entreated

 certain writers affirm, the Christians made common emprise for the
 recovery of the <placeName>Holy Land</placeName>. Whereof that most valiant prince,
 Saladin, then Soldan of <placeName>Babylon</placeName>ia, being in good time apprised,
 resolved to see for himself the preparations made by the Christian
 potentates for the said emprise, that he might put himself in better
 trim to meet them.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090006"/>So, having ordered all things to his mind in
 <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, he made as if he were bound on a pilgrimage, and attended
 only by two of his chiefest and sagest lords, and three servants, took
 the road in the guise of a merchant.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090007"/>And having surveyed many
 provinces of Christendom, as they rode through <placeName>Lombardy</placeName> with
 intent to cross the Alps, they chanced, between <placeName>Milan</placeName> and <placeName>Pavia</placeName>, to
 fall in with a gentleman, one Messer Torello d'Istria da <placeName>Pavia</placeName>, who
 with his servants and his dogs and falcons was betaking him to a fine
 estate that he had on the <placeName>Ticino</placeName>, there to tarry a while.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090008"/>Now
 Messer Torello no sooner espied Saladin and his lords than he
 guessed them to be gentlemen and foreigners; and, being zealous to
 do them honour, when Saladin asked one of his servants how far
 off <placeName>Pavia</placeName> might still be, and if he might win there in time to enter
 the town, he suffered not the servant to make answer, but: <q>No,
 gentlemen,</q> quoth he, <q>by the time you reach <placeName>Pavia</placeName> 'twill be too
 late for you to enter.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090009"/><q>So!</q> replied Saladin, <q>then might you
 be pleased to direct us, as we are strangers, where we may best be
 lodged?</q><q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090010"/>That gladly will I,</q> returned Messer Torello. <q>I
 was but now thinking to send one of these my men on an errand to
 <placeName>Pavia</placeName>; I will send him with you, and he will guide you to a place
 where you will find very comfortable quarters.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090011"/>Then, turning to
 one of his most trusty servants, he gave him his instructions, and
 despatched him with them: after which, he repaired to his estate,
 and forthwith, as best he might, caused a goodly supper to be made
 ready, and the tables set in his garden; which done, he stationed
 himself at the gate on the look-out for his guests.</p><p>The servant, conversing with the gentlemen of divers matters,
 brought them by devious roads to his lord's estate without their being
 ware of it.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090012"/>Whom as soon as Messer Torello espied, he came forth
 afoot to meet them, and said with a smile: <q>A hearty welcome to
 <pb n="372"/>you, gentlemen.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090013"/>Now Saladin, being very quick of apprehension,
 perceived that the knight had doubted, when he met them, that, were
 he to bid them to his house, they might not accept his hospitality;
 and accordingly, that it might not be in their power to decline it, had
 brought them to his house by a ruse. And so, returning his greeting:
 <q>Sir,</q> quoth he, <q>were it meet to find fault with those that shew
 courtesy, we should have a grievance against you, for that, to say
 nought of somewhat delaying our journey, you have in guerdon of
 a single greeting constrained us to accept so noble a courtesy as
 yours.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090014"/>Whereto the knight, who was of good understanding and
 well-spoken, made answer: <q>Gentlemen, such courtesy as we
 shew you will, in comparison of that which, by what I gather from
 your aspect, were meet for you, prove but a sorry thing; but in sooth
 this side of <placeName>Pavia</placeName> you might not anywhere have been well lodged;
 wherefore take it not amiss that you have come somewhat out of
 your way to find less discomfortable quarters.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090015"/>And as he spoke,
 about them flocked the servants, who, having helped them to dismount,
 saw to their horses; whereupon Messer Torello conducted them to
 the chambers that were made ready for them, where, having caused
 them to be relieved of their boots, and refreshed with the coolest of
 wines, he held pleasant converse with them until supper-time.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090016"/>Saladin and his lords and servants all knew Latin, so that they both
 understood and made themselves understood very well, and there
 was none of them but adjudged this knight to be the most agreeable
 and debonair man, and therewithal the best talker, that he had ever
 seen;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090017"/>while to Messer Torello, on the other hand, they shewed as
 far greater magnificoes than he had at first supposed, whereby he was
 inly vexed that he had not been able that evening to do them the
 honours of company, and a more ceremonious banquet. For which
 default he resolved to make amends on the ensuing morning: wherefore,
 having imparted to one of his servants that which he would have
 done, he sent him to his most judicious and highminded lady at
 <placeName>Pavia</placeName>, which was close by, and where never a gate was locked.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090018"/>Which done, he brought the gentlemen into the garden, and courteously
 asked them who they were. <q>We are Cypriote merchants,</q>
 replied Saladin, <q>and 'tis from <placeName>Cyprus</placeName> we come, and we are on our
 way to <placeName>Paris</placeName> on business.</q> Quoth then Messer Torello: <q>Would
 to God that our country bred gentlemen of such a quality as are the
 <pb n="373"/>merchants that I see <placeName>Cyprus</placeName> breeds!</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090019"/>From which they passed to
 discourse of other matters, until, supper-time being come, he
 besought them to seat them at table; whereat, considering that
 the supper was but improvised, their entertainment was excellent
 and well-ordered.</p><p>The tables being cleared, Messer Torello, surmising that they
 must be weary, kept them no long time from their rest, but bestowed
 them in most comfortable beds, and soon after went to rest himself.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090020"/>Meanwhile the servant that he had sent to <placeName>Pavia</placeName> did his lord's errand
 to the lady, who, in the style rather of a queen than of a housewife,
 forthwith assembled not a few of Messer Torello's friends and vassals,
 and caused all meet preparation to be made for a magnificent banquet,
 and by messengers bearing torches bade not a few of the noblest of
 the citizens thereto; and had store of silken and other fabrics and
 vair brought in, and all set in order in every point as her husband
 had directed.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090021"/>Day came, and the gentlemen being risen, Messer
 Torello got him to horse with them, and having sent for his hawks,
 brought them to a ford, and shewed them how the hawks flew.
 By and by, Saladin requesting of him a guide to the best inn at
 <placeName>Pavia</placeName>: <q>I myself will be your guide,</q> returned Messer Torello,
 <q>for I have occasion to go thither.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090022"/>Which offer they, nothing
 doubting, did gladly accept, and so with him they set forth; and
 about tierce, being come to the city, and expecting to be directed to
 the best inn, they were brought by Messer Torello to his own house,
 where they were forthwith surrounded by full fifty of the greatest
 folk of the city, gathered there to give the gentlemen a welcome;
 and 'twas who should hold a bridle or a stirrup, while they dismounted.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090023"/>Whereby Saladin and his lords more than guessing the
 truth: <q>Messer Torello,</q> quoth they, <q>'twas not this that we
 craved of you. Honour enough had we from you last night, and
 far in excess of our desires; wherefore thou mightst very well have
 left us to go our own road.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090024"/>Whereto: <q>Gentlemen,</q> replied
 Messer Torello, <q>for that which was done yestereve I have to thank
 Fortune rather than you: seeing that Fortune surprised you on the
 road at an hour when you must needs repair to my little house: for
 that which shall be done this morning I shall be beholden to you, as
 will also these gentlemen that surround you, with whom, if you
 deem it courteous so to do, you may refuse to breakfast, if you
 like.</q></p><pb n="374"/><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090025"/>Fairly conquered, Saladin and his lords dismounted, and heartily
 welcomed by the gentlemen, were conducted to the chambers which
 had been most sumptuously adorned for their use; and having laid
 aside their riding dress, and taken some refreshment, repaired to the
 saloon, where all had been made ready with splendour. There,
 having washed their hands, they sat them down to table, and were
 regaled with a magnificent repast of many courses, served with all
 stately and fair ceremony, insomuch that, had the Emperor himself
 been there, 'twould not have been possible to do him more honour.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090026"/>And albeit Saladin and his lords were grandees, and used to exceeding
 great displays of pomp and state, nevertheless this shewed to them
 as not a little marvellous, and one of the greatest they had ever seen,
 having regard to the quality of their host, whom they knew to be
 but a citizen, and no lord.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090027"/>Breakfast done, and the tables cleared,
 they conversed a while of high matters, and then, as 'twas very hot,
 all the gentlemen of <placeName>Pavia</placeName>--so it pleased Messer Torello--retired for
 their siesta, while he remained with his three guests; with whom he
 presently withdrew into a chamber, whither, that there might be
 nought that he held dear which they had not seen, he called his
 noble lady.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090028"/>And so the dame, exceeding fair and stately of person,
 and arrayed in rich apparel, with her two little boys, that shewed as
 two angels, on either hand, presented herself before them, and
 graciously greeted them. Whereupon they rose, and returned her
 salutation with reverence, and caused her to sit down among them,
 and made much of her two little boys.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090029"/>But after some interchange
 of gracious discourse, Messer Torello being withdrawn somewhat
 apart, she asked them courteously, whence they came and whither
 they were bound, and had of them the same answer that Messer
 Torello had received.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090030"/><q>So!</q> quoth the lady with a joyful air,
 <q>then I see that my woman's wit will be of service to you; wherefore
 I pray you as a special favour neither to reject nor to despise the
 little gift that I am about to present to you; but reflecting that, as
 women have but small minds, so they make but small gifts, accept it,
 having regard rather to the good will of the giver than the magnitude
 of the gift.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090031"/>She then caused bring forth for each of them
 two pair of robes, lined the one with silk, the other with vair, no
 such robes as citizens or merchants, but such as lords, use to wear,
 and three vests of taffeta, besides linen clothes, and: <q>Take them,</q><pb n="375"/>quoth she. <q>The robes I give you are even such as I have arrayed
 my lord withal: the other things, considering that you are far from
 your wives, and have come a long way, and have yet a long way to
 go, and that merchants love to be neat and trim, may, albeit they
 are of no great value, be yet acceptable to you.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090032"/>Wondering, the gentlemen acknowledged without reserve that
 there was no point of courtesy wherein Messer Torello was not
 minded to acquit himself towards them. And noting the lordly
 fashion of the robes, unsuited to the quality of merchants, they misdoubted
 that Messer Torello had recognized them. However, quoth
 one of them to the lady: <q>Gifts great indeed are these, Madam,
 nor such as lightly to accept, were it not that thereto we are constrained
 by your prayers, to which we may on no account say, no.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090033"/>Whereupon, Messer Torello being now come back, the lady bade
 them adieu, and took her leave of them; and in like manner did she
 cause their servants to be supplied with equipment suitable to them.
 The gentlemen, being much importuned thereto by Messer Torello,
 consented to tarry the rest of the day with him; and so, having
 slept, they donned their robes, and rode a while with him about the
 city; and supper-time being come, they feasted magnificently, and
 with a numerous and honourable company.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090034"/>And so in due time
 they betook them to rest; and at daybreak, being risen, they found,
 in lieu of their jaded nags, three stout and excellent palfreys, and in
 like manner fresh and goodly mounts for their servants. Which
 Saladin marking turned to his lords, and:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090035"/><q>By God,</q> quoth he,
 <q>never was gentleman more complete and courteous and considerate
 than this Messer Torello, and if the Christian kings are as kingly as
 he is knightly, there is none of them whose onset the Soldan of
 <placeName>Babylon</placeName> might well abide, to say nought of so many as we see making
 ready to fall upon him.</q> However, knowing that 'twas not permissible
 to refuse, he very courteously thanked Messer Torello: and
 so they got them to horse.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090036"/>Messer Torello with a numerous company
 escorted them far beyond the gate of the city, until, loath
 though Saladin was to part from him, so greatly did he now affect
 him, yet as he must needs speed on, he besought him to turn back.
 Whereupon, albeit it irked him to take leave of them:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090037"/><q>Gentlemen,</q>
 quoth Messer Torello, <q>since such is your pleasure, I obey;
 but this I must say to you. Who you are I know not, nor would I
 <pb n="376"/>know more than you are pleased to impart; but whoever you may
 be, you will not make me believe that you are merchants this while;
 and so adieu!</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090038"/>To whom Saladin, having already taken leave of
 all his company, thus made answer: <q>Peradventure, Sir, we shall
 one day give you to see somewhat of our merchandise, and thereby
 confirm your belief: and so adieu!</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090039"/>Thus parted Saladin and his company from Messer Torello,
 Saladin burning with an exceeding great desire, if life should be continued
 to him, and the war, which he anticipated, should not undo
 him, to shew Messer Torello no less honour than he had received at
 his hands, and conversing not a little with his lords both of Messer
 Torello himself and of his lady, and all that he did and that in any wise
 concerned him, ever more highly commending them.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090040"/>However,
 having with much diligence spied out all the West, he put to sea,
 and returned with his company to <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>; and having now all
 needful information, he put himself in a posture of defence. Messer
 Torello, his mind full of his late guests, returned to <placeName>Pavia</placeName>; but,
 though he long pondered who they might be, he came never at or
 anywhere near the truth.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090041"/>Then with great and general mustering of forces came the time
 for embarking on the emprise, and Messer Torello, heeding not the
 tearful entreaties of his wife, resolved to join therein. So, being fully
 equipped and about to take horse, he said to his lady, whom he most
 dearly loved:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090042"/><q>Wife, for honour's sake and for the weal of my
 soul, I go, as thou seest, on this emprise: our substance and our
 honour I commend to thy care. Certain I am of my departure, but,
 for the thousand accidents that may ensue, certitude have I none of
 my return: wherefore I would have thee do me this grace, that,
 whatever be my fate, shouldst thou lack certain intelligence that I
 live, thou wilt expect me a year and a month and a day from this
 my departure, before thou marry again.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090043"/>Whereto the lady, weeping
 bitterly, made answer: <q>Messer Torello, I know not how I
 shall support the distress in which, thus departing, you leave me;
 but should my life not fail beneath it, and aught befall thee,
 live and die secure that I shall live and die the wife of Messer
 Torello, and of his memory.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090044"/>Whereupon: <q>Wife,</q> returned
 Messer Torello, <q>well assured I am that, so far as in thee
 shall lie, this promise of thine will be kept; but thou art
 <pb n="377"/>young, and fair, and of a great family, and thy virtue is rare and
 generally known:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090045"/>wherefore I make no doubt that, should there be
 any suspicion of my death, thou wilt be asked of thy brothers and
 kinsmen by many a great gentleman: against whose attacks, though
 thou desire it never so, thou wilt not be able to hold out, but wilt
 perforce be fain to gratify one or other of them; for which cause it
 is that I ask thee to wait just so long and no longer.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090046"/><q>As I have
 said,</q> replied the lady, <q>so, in so far as I may, I shall do; and if I
 must needs do otherwise, rest assured that of this your behest I shall
 render you obedience. But I pray God that He bring neither you
 nor me to such a strait yet a while.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090047"/>Which said, the lady wept,
 and having embraced Messer Torello, drew from her finger a ring,
 and gave it to him, saying: <q>Should it betide that I die before I
 see you again, mind you of me, when you look upon it.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090048"/>Messer Torello took the ring, and got him to horse, and having
 bidden all adieu, fared forth on his journey; and being arrived with
 his company at <placeName>Genoa</placeName>, he embarked on a galley, and having departed
 thence, in no long time arrived at Acre, and joined the main
 Christian host;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090049"/>wherein there by and by broke out an exceeding
 great and mortal sickness; during which, whether owing to Saladin's
 strategy, or his good fortune, he made an easy capture of well-nigh
 all the remnant of the Christians that were escaped, and quartered
 them in divers prisons in many cities;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090050"/>of which captives Messer
 Torello being one, was brought to <placeName>Alexandria</placeName> and there confined.
 Where, not being known, and fearing to make himself known, he,
 under constraint of necessity, applied him to the training of hawks,
 whereof he was a very great master; and thereby he fell under the
 notice of Saladin, who took him out of the prison, and made him his
 falconer.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090051"/>The Soldan called him by no other name than <q>Christian,</q>
 and neither recognized, nor was recognized by, him, who, his
 whole soul ever in <placeName>Pavia</placeName>, essayed many a time to escape, that he
 might return thither, but still without success:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090052"/>wherefore, certain
 Genoese, that were come to <placeName>Alexandria</placeName> as ambassadors to the Soldan
 for the redemption of some of their townsfolk, being about to return,
 he resolved to write to his lady, how that he lived, and would come
 back to her, as soon as he might, and that she should expect his
 return; and having so done, he earnestly besought one of the
 ambassadors, whom he knew, to see that the letter reached the
 <pb n="378"/>hands of the Abbot of San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro, who was his
 uncle.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090053"/>Now, such being the posture of Messer Torello's affairs, it befell
 one day that, while he talked with Saladin of his hawks, he smiled;
 whereby his mouth shaped itself in a fashion, of which Saladin had
 taken particular note, while he was at <placeName>Pavia</placeName>. And so, recalling
 Messer Torello to mind, he fixed his gaze upon him, and it seemed
 to him that 'twas indeed Messer Torello; wherefore, leaving the
 matter of which they were conversing: <q>Tell me, Christian,</q>
 quoth he, <q>of what country art thou in the West?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090054"/><q>My lord,</q>
 replied Messer Torello, <q>I am a Lombard, of a city called <placeName>Pavia</placeName>, a
 poor man, and of humble condition.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090055"/>Which when he heard,
 Saladin, well-nigh resolved of his doubt, said joyfully to himself:
 <q>God has provided me with occasion meet to prove to this man
 what store I set by his courtesy;</q> and without another word he
 brought him into a room where he kept all his wearing apparel, and
 said: <q>Look, Christian, if among these robes there be any that
 thou hast ever seen before.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090056"/>So Messer Torello examined the robes,
 and espied those which his lady had given to Saladin; but, deeming
 they could not be the same, he replied: <q>My lord, there is no robe
 here that I recognize, albeit 'tis true that those two robes are such as
 I once wore myself, in company with three merchants that came to
 my house.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090057"/>Whereupon Saladin could refrain himself no longer;
 but, tenderly embracing him: <q>You,</q> quoth he, <q>are Messer
 Torello d'Istria, and I am one of those three merchants to whom
 your lady gave these robes; and now is the time to warrant you of
 the quality of my merchandise, as, when I parted from you, I told
 you might come to pass.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090058"/>Which to hear, Messer Torello was at
 once overjoyed and abashed, overjoyed to have entertained so illustrious
 a guest, and abashed, for that it seemed to him that he
 had given him but a sorry entertainment. To whom: <q>Messer
 Torello,</q> quoth Saladin, <q>since hither has God sent you to me,
 deem that 'tis no more I that am lord here, but you.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090059"/>And so
 they made great cheer together; and then Saladin caused Messer
 Torello to be royally arrayed; and presented him to all his greatest
 lords, and having extolled his merit in no stinted measure, bade
 all, as they hoped for grace from him, honour Messer Torello
 even as himself. And so from that hour did they all; but most
 <pb n="379"/>especially the two lords that had been with Saladin at Messer Torello's
 house.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090060"/>The glory, to which Messer Torello thus suddenly found himself
 raised, somewhat diverted his mind from the affairs of <placeName>Lombardy</placeName>,
 and the more so, for that he entertained no doubt that his letter
 had reached his uncle's hands.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090061"/>But for that in the camp, or rather
 army, of the Christians, on the day when they were taken by Saladin,
 there died and was buried one Messer Torello de Dignes, an obscure
 knight of <placeName>Provence</placeName>, whereas Messer Torello d'Istria was known to
 all the host for a right noble gentleman, whoso heard tell that
 Messer Torello was dead, supposed that 'twas Messer Torello d'Istria,
 and not Messer Torello de Dignes; nor did what happened after,
 to wit, the capture, avail to undeceive them;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090062"/>for not a few Italians
 had carried the report home with them; among whom there were
 some who made bold to say that they had seen Messer Torello
 d'Istria's dead body, and had been present at its interment.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090063"/>Which
 rumour coming to the ears of his lady and his kinsfolk, great indeed,
 nay, immeasurable was the distress that it occasioned not only to
 them, but to all that had known him.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090064"/>The mode and measure of his
 lady's grief, her mourning, her lamentation, 'twere tedious to describe.
 Enough that, after some months spent in almost unmitigated
 tribulation, her sorrow shewed signs of abatement; whereupon, suit
 being made for her hand by some of the greatest men of <placeName>Lombardy</placeName>,
 her brothers and other kinsfolk began to importune her to marry
 again. Times not a few, and with floods of tears, she refused; but,
 overborne at last, she consented to do as they would have her, upon
 the understanding that she was to remain unmarried until the term
 for which she had bound herself to Messer Torello was fulfilled.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090065"/>Now the lady's affairs being in this posture at <placeName>Pavia</placeName>, it befell
 that some eight days or so before the time appointed for her marriage,
 Messer Torello one day espied in <placeName>Alexandria</placeName> one that he had
 observed go with the Genoese ambassadors aboard the galley that
 took them to <placeName>Genoa</placeName>; wherefore he called him, and asked him what
 sort of a voyage they had had, and when they had reached <placeName>Genoa</placeName>.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090066"/><q>My lord,</q> replied the other, <q>the galley made but a sorry voyage of
 it, as I learned in <placeName>Crete</placeName>, where I remained; for that, while she was
 nearing <placeName>Sicily</placeName>, there arose a terrible gale from the North that drove
 her on to the shoals of Barbary, and never a soul escaped, and among
 <pb n="380"/>the rest my two brothers were lost.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090067"/>Which report believing--and
 'twas indeed most true--and calling to mind that in a few days the
 term that he had asked of his wife would be fulfilled, and surmising
 that there could be no tidings of him at <placeName>Pavia</placeName>, Messer Torello made
 no question but that the lady was provided with another husband;
 whereby he sank into such a depth of woe that he lost all power to
 eat, and betook him to his bed and resigned himself to die.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090068"/>Which
 when Saladin, by whom he was most dearly beloved, learned, he
 came to him, and having plied him with many and most instant
 entreaties, learned at length the cause of his distress and sickness;
 and, having chidden him not a little that he had not sooner apprised
 him thereof, he besought him to put on a cheerful courage, assuring
 him, that, if so he did, he would bring it to pass that he should be in
 <placeName>Pavia</placeName> at the time appointed, and told him how.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090069"/>Believing Saladin's
 words the more readily that he had many times heard that 'twas
 possible, and had not seldom been done, Messer Torello recovered
 heart, and was instant with Saladin that he should make all haste.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090070"/>Accordingly Saladin bade one of his necromancers, of whose skill
 he had already had proof, to devise a method whereby Messer Torello
 should be transported abed in a single night to <placeName>Pavia</placeName>: the necromancer
 made answer that it should be done, but that 'twere best
 he put Messer Torello to sleep.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090071"/>The matter being thus arranged,
 Saladin hied him back to Messer Torello, and finding him most
 earnestly desirous to be in <placeName>Pavia</placeName> at the time appointed, if so it might
 be, and if not, to die:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090072"/><q>Messer Torello,</q> quoth he, <q>if you dearly
 love your lady, and misdoubt that she may become the bride of
 another, no wise, God wot, do I censure you, for that, of all the
 ladies that ever I saw, she, for bearing, manners, and address--to say
 nought of beauty, which is but the flower that perishes--seems to
 me the most worthy to be lauded and cherished.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090073"/>Much had I been
 gratified, since Fortune has sent you hither to me, that, while you and
 I yet live, we had exercised equal lordship in the governance of this
 my realm,  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090074"/>and, if such was not God's will, and this must needs come
 upon you, that you are fain either to be at <placeName>Pavia</placeName> at the time
 appointed or to die, I had desired of all things to have been apprised
 thereof at such a time that I might have sent you home with such
 honourable circumstance and state and escort as befit your high
 desert; which not being vouchsafed me, and as nought will content
 <pb n="381"/>you but to be there forthwith, I do what I can, and speed you
 thither on such wise as I have told you.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090075"/><q>My lord,</q> replied Messer
 Torello, <q>had you said nought, you have already done enough to
 prove your goodwill towards me, and that in so high a degree as is
 quite beyond my deserts, and most assured of the truth of what you
 say shall I live and die, and so had done, had you not said it; but,
 seeing that my resolve is taken, I pray you that that, which you
 promise to do, be done speedily, for that after to-morrow I may no
 longer count on being expected.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090076"/>Saladin assured him that 'twas so ordered that he should not be
 disappointed. And on the morrow, it being his purpose to speed
 him on his journey that same night, he caused to be set up in one of
 his great halls a most goodly and sumptuous bed composed of mattresses,
 all, as was their wont, of velvet and cloth of gold, and had it
 covered with a quilt, adorned at certain intervals with enormous
 pearls, and most rare precious stones, insomuch that 'twas in after
 time accounted a priceless treasure, and furnished with two pillows
 to match it.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090077"/>Which done, he bade array Messer Torello, who was
 now quite recovered, in a robe after the Saracenic fashion, the
 richest and goodliest thing of the kind that was ever seen, and wrap
 about his head, according to their wont, one of their huge turbans.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090078"/>Then, at a late hour, Saladin, attended by certain of his lords,
 entered the chamber where Messer Torello was, and seating himself
 beside him, all but wept as thus he began:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090079"/><q>Messer Torello, the
 time is nigh at hand when you and I must part; wherefore, since
 I may neither give you my own, nor others' company (the journey
 that you are about to make not permitting it), I am come here, as
 'tis fitting, in this chamber to take my leave of you.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090080"/>Wherefore,
 before I bid you adieu, I entreat you, by that friendship, that love,
 which is between us, that you forget me not, and that, if it be
 possible, when you have settled your affairs in <placeName>Lombardy</placeName>, you come
 at least once, before our days are ended, to visit me, that thereby I
 may both have the delight of seeing you again, and make good that
 omission which, by reason of your haste, I must needs now make;
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090081"/>and that in the meanwhile it irk thee not to visit me by letter,
 and to ask of me whatever you shall have a mind to, and be sure
 that there lives not the man whom I shall content more gladly
 than you.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090082"/>Messer Torello could not refrain his tears, and so,
 <pb n="382"/>with words few, and broken by his sobs, he answered that 'twas
 impossible that the Soldan's generous deeds and chivalrous character
 should ever be forgotten by him, and that without fail he would
 do as he bade him, so soon as occasion should serve him.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090083"/>Whereupon
 Saladin tenderly embraced and kissed him, and with many a
 tear bade him adieu, and quitted the chamber. His lords then took
 leave of Messer Torello, and followed Saladin into the hall, where
 he had had the bed made ready.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090084"/>'Twas now late, and the necromancer being intent to hasten
 Messer Torello's transit, a physician brought him a potion, and
 having first shewn him what he was to give him by way of viaticum,
 caused him to drink it;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090085"/>and not long after he fell asleep. In which
 state he was carried by Saladin's command, and laid on the goodly
 bed, whereon he set a large and fair and most sumptuous crown,
 marking it in such sort that there could be no mistake that it was
 sent by Saladin to Messer Torello's wife.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090086"/>He next placed on
 Messer Torello's finger a ring, in which was set a carbuncle of
 such brilliance that it shewed as a lighted torch, and of well-nigh
 inestimable value. After which he girded on him a sword, the
 appointments of which might not readily be appraised. And therewithal
 he adorned him in front with a pendant, wherein were
 pearls, the like of which had never been seen, and not a few other
 rare jewels. And, moreover, on either side of him he set two
 vast basins of gold full of pistoles; and strings of pearls not a few,
 and rings and girdles, and other things, which 'twere tedious to
 enumerate, he disposed around him.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090087"/>Which done, he kissed Messer
 Torello again, and bade the necromancer speed him on his journey.
 Whereupon, forthwith, the bed, with Messer Torello thereon, was
 borne away from before Saladin's eyes, and he and his barons
 remained conversing thereof.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090088"/>The bed, as Messer Torello had requested, had already been
 deposited in the church of <placeName>San Piero in Ciel d'Oro</placeName> at <placeName>Pavia</placeName>, and
 Messer Torello, with all the aforesaid jewels and ornaments upon
 and about him, was lying thereon, and still slept, when, upon the
 stroke of matins, the sacristan came into the church, light in hand,
 and presently setting eyes on the sumptuous bed, was not only
 amazed, but mightily terrified, insomuch that he turned back, and
 took to flight. Which the abbot and monks observing with no small
 <pb n="383"/>surprise, asked wherefore he fled; and he told them. Whereupon:
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090089"/><q>Oh,</q> quoth the abbot, <q>thou art no longer a child, nor
 yet so new to this church, that thou shouldst so lightly be appalled:
 go we now, and see who it is that has given thee this childish fright.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090090"/>So, with a blaze of torches, the abbot, attended by his monks, entered
 the church, and espied this wondrous costly bed whereon the knight
 slept, and while, hesitant and fearful, daring not to approach the bed,
 they scanned the rare and splendid jewels, it befell that, the efficacy
 of the potion being exhausted, Messer Torello awoke and heaved a
 great sigh.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090091"/>Whereat the monks and the abbot quaking and crying
 out: <q>Lord, help us!</q> one and all took to flight.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090092"/>Messer Torello,
 opening his eyes and looking about him, saw, to his no small satisfaction,
 that without a doubt he was in the very place where he had craved of
 Saladin to be; so up he sate, and taking particular note of the
 matters with which he was surrounded, accounted the magnificence
 of Saladin to exceed even the measure, great though it was, that he
 already knew.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090093"/>However, he still kept quiet, save that, perceiving
 the monks in flight, and surmising the reason, he began to call the
 abbot by name, bidding him be of good courage, for that he was his
 nephew, Torello.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090094"/>Whereat the abbot did but wax more terrified,
 for that he deemed Torello had been many a month dead; but, after
 a while, as he heard himself still called, sound judgment got the
 better of his fears, and making the sign of the cross, he drew nigh
 Torello;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090095"/>who said to him: <q>Father, what is't you fear? By
 God's grace I live, and hither am come back from overseas.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090096"/>Whom,
 for all he had grown a long beard and was dressed in the Saracenic
 fashion, the abbot after a while recognized, and now, quite reassured,
 took by the hand, saying: <q>Son, welcome home:</q> then: <q>No
 cause hast thou to marvel at our fears,</q> he went on, <q>seeing that
 there is never a soul in these parts but firmly believes thee to be
 dead, insomuch that I may tell thee that Madonna <persName>Adalieta</persName>, thy wife,
 overborne by the entreaties and menaces of her kinsfolk, and against
 her will, is provided with another husband, to whom she is this
 morning to go, and all is made ready for the nuptials and the
 attendant festivities.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090097"/>Whereupon Messer Torello, being risen from the sumptuous
 bed, did the abbot and the monks wondrous cheer, and besought
 them, one and all, to tell never a soul of his return, until he had
 <pb n="384"/>completed something that he had on hand. After which, having
 put the costly jewels in safe keeping, he recounted to the abbot all
 the story of his adventures to that very hour.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090098"/>The abbot, rejoicing
 in his good fortune, joined with him in offering thanks to God.
 Messer Torello then asked him who might be his wife's new husband,
 and the abbot told him.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090099"/>Quoth then Messer Torello:
 <q>Before my return be known, I purpose to see how my wife will
 comport herself at the nuptials: wherefore, though 'tis not the wont
 of men of religion to go to such gatherings, I had lief that for love of
 me you arranged for us to go thither together.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090100"/>The abbot answered
 that he would gladly do so, and as soon as 'twas day, he sent word
 to the bridegroom that he had thoughts of being present at his
 nuptials, accompanied by a friend; whereto the gentleman made
 answer that he was much gratified.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090101"/>So, at the breakfast hour Messer
 Torello, dressed as he was, hied him with the abbot to the bridegroom's
 house, as many as saw them gazing on him with wonder,
 but none recognizing him, and the abbot giving all to understand
 that he was a Saracen sent by the Soldan as ambassador to the King
 of <placeName>France</placeName>.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090102"/>Messer Torello was accordingly seated at a table directly
 opposite that of his lady, whom he eyed with exceeding great delight,
 the more so that he saw that in her face which shewed him that she
 was chagrined by the nuptials. She in like manner from time to time
 bent her regard on him; howbeit, what with his long beard, and his
 foreign garb, and her firm persuasion that he was dead, she had still
 no sort of recollection of him.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090103"/>However, Messer Torello at length
 deemed it time to make trial of her, whether she would remember
 him; wherefore he took the ring that the lady had given him on his
 departure, and keeping it close in the palm of his hand, he called to
 him a page that waited upon her, and said to him:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090104"/><q>Tell the
 bride from me that 'tis the custom in my country, that, when a
 stranger, such as I, eats with a bride, like herself, at her wedding-feast,
 she, in token that he is welcome to her board, sends him the
 cup from which she herself drinks, full of wine; and when the
 stranger has drunk his fill, he closes the cup, and the bride drinks
 what is left therein.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090105"/>The page carried the message to the lady, who, being of good
 understanding and manners, and supposing him to be some very great
 man, by way of shewing that she was gratified by his presence,
 com<pb n="385"/>manded
 that a gilt cup, that was on the table before her, should be
 rinsed, and filled with wine, and borne to the gentleman.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090106"/>Which
 being done, Messer Torello, having privily conveyed her ring into
 his mouth, let it fall (while he drank) into the cup on such wise that
 none wist thereof; and leaving but a little wine at the bottom, closed
 the cup and returned it to the lady;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090107"/>who, having taken it, that she
 might do full honour to the custom of her guest's country, lifted
 the lid, and set the cup to her mouth; whereby espying the ring,
 she thereon mutely gazed a while, and recognizing it for that which
 she had given Messer Torello on his departure, she steadfastly
 regarded the supposed stranger, whom now she also recognized.
 Whereupon well-nigh distracted, oversetting the table in front of
 her, she exclaimed: <q>'Tis my lord, 'tis verily Messer Torello;</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090108"/>and rushing to the table at which he sate, giving never a thought to
 her apparel, or aught that was on the table, she flung herself upon
 it; and reaching forward as far as she could, she threw her arms
 about him, and hugged him; nor, for aught that any said or did,
 could she be induced to release his neck, until Messer Torello himself
 bade her forbear a while, for that she would have time enough
 to kiss him thereafter.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090109"/>The lady then stood up, and for a while all
 was disorder, albeit the feast was yet more gladsome than before by
 reason of the recovery of so honourable a knight: then, at Messer
 Torello's entreaty, all were silent, while he recounted to them the
 story of his adventures from the day of his departure to that hour,
 concluding by saying that the gentleman who, deeming him to be

 resigned the ring and the crown that her new spouse had given her,
 and put on the ring she had taken from the cup, and likewise the
 crown sent her by the Soldan; and so, forth they hied them, and
 with full nuptial pomp wended their way to Messer Torello's house;
 and there for a great while they made merry with his late disconsolate
 friends and kinsfolk and all the citizens, who accounted his
 restoration as little short of a miracle.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090112"/>Messer Torello, having bestowed part of his rare jewels upon

 sent word of his safe home-coming and prosperous estate to Saladin,
 acknowledging himself ever his friend and vassal, lived many years

 than of yore.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00090113"/>Such, then, was the end of the troubles of

 Kings and Soldans and folk of the like quality; wherefore, that I
 stray not too far from you, I am minded to tell you somewhat of a
 Marquis; certes, nought magnificent, but a piece of mad folly, albeit
 there came good thereof to him in the end. The which I counsel
 none to copy, for that great pity 'twas that it turned out well with
 him.</p></body></floatingText><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100004"/>There was in olden days a certain Marquis of <placeName>Saluzzo</placeName>, Gualtieri
 <pb n="388"/>by name, a young man, but head of the house, who, having
 neither wife nor child, passed his time in nought else but in hawking
 and hunting, and of taking a wife and begetting children had
 no thought; wherein he should have been accounted very wise:
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100005"/>but his vassals, brooking it ill, did oftentimes entreat him to take
 a wife, that he might not die without an heir, and they be left
 without a lord; offering to find him one of such a pattern, and
 of such parentage, that he might marry with good hope, and be
 well content with the sequel.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100006"/>To whom: <q>My friends,</q> replied
 Gualtieri, <q>you enforce me to that which I had resolved never to do,
 seeing how hard it is to find a wife, whose ways accord well with
 one's own, and how plentiful is the supply of such as run counter
 thereto, and how grievous a life he leads who chances upon a lady
 that matches ill with him.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100007"/>And to say that you think to know the
 daughters by the qualities of their fathers and mothers, and thereby--so
 you would argue--to provide me with a wife to my liking, is but
 folly; for I wot not how you may penetrate the secrets of their
 mothers so as to know their fathers; and granted that you do know
 them, daughters oftentimes resemble neither of their parents.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100008"/>However,
 as you are minded to rivet these fetters upon me, I am content
 that so it be; and that I may have no cause to reproach any but
 myself, should it turn out ill, I am resolved that my wife shall be of
 my own choosing; but of this rest assured, that, no matter whom
 I choose, if she receive not from you the honour due to a lady, you
 shall prove to your great cost, how sorely I resent being thus constrained
 by your importunity to take a wife against my will.</q></p><p>The worthy men replied that they were well content, so only he
 would marry without more ado.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100009"/>And Gualtieri, who had long noted
 with approval the mien of a poor girl that dwelt on a farm hard by
 his house, and found her fair enough, deemed that with her he might
 pass a tolerably happy life. Wherefore he sought no further, but
 forthwith resolved to marry her; and having sent for her father, who
 was a very poor man, he contracted with him to take her to wife.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100010"/>Which done, Gualtieri assembled all the friends he had in those parts,
 and: <q>My friends,</q> quoth he, <q>you were and are minded that I
 should take a wife, and rather to comply with your wishes, than for
 any desire that I had to marry, I have made up my mind to do so.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100011"/>You remember the promise you gave me, to wit, that, whomsoever I
 <pb n="389"/>should take, you would pay her the honour due to a lady. Which
 promise I now require you to keep, the time being come when I am
 to keep mine.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100012"/>I have found hard by here a maiden after mine own
 heart, whom I purpose to take to wife, and to bring hither to my
 house in the course of a few days. Wherefore bethink you, how
 you may make the nuptial feast splendid, and welcome her with all
 honour; that I may confess myself satisfied with your observance of
 your promise, as you will be with my observance of mine.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100013"/>The
 worthy men, one and all, answered with alacrity that they were well
 content, and that, whoever she might be, they would entreat her as
 a lady, and pay her all due honour as such. After which, they all
 addressed them to make goodly and grand and gladsome celebration
 of the event, as did also Gualtieri.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100014"/>He arranged for a wedding most
 stately and fair, and bade thereto a goodly number of his friends and
 kinsfolk, and great gentlemen, and others, of the neighbourhood;
 and therewithal he caused many a fine and costly robe to be cut and
 fashioned to the figure of a girl who seemed to him of the like proportions
 as the girl that he purposed to wed; and laid in store,
 besides, of girdles and rings, with a costly and beautiful crown, and
 all the other paraphernalia of a bride.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100015"/>The day that he had appointed for the wedding being come,
 about half tierce he got him to horse with as many as had come to
 do him honour, and having made all needful dispositions: <q>Gentlemen,</q>
 quoth he, <q>'tis time to go bring home the bride.</q> And so
 away he rode with his company to the village;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100016"/>where, being come
 to the house of the girl's father, they found her returning from the
 spring with a bucket of water, making all the haste she could, that
 she might afterwards go with the other women to see Gualtieri's
 bride come by. Whom Gualtieri no sooner saw, than he called her
 by her name, to wit, <persName>Griselda</persName>, and asked her where her father was.
 To whom she modestly made answer: <q>My lord, he is in the house.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100017"/>Whereupon Gualtieri dismounted, and having bidden the rest await
 him without, entered the cottage alone; and meeting her father,
 whose name was Giannucolo: <q>I am come,</q> quoth he, <q>to wed
 <persName>Griselda</persName>, but first of all there are some matters I would learn from
 her own lips in thy presence.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100018"/>He then asked her, whether, if he
 took her to wife, she would study to comply with his wishes, and be
 not wroth, no matter what he might say or do, and be obedient,
 <pb n="390"/>with not a few other questions of a like sort: to all which she
 answered, ay.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100019"/>Whereupon Gualtieri took her by the hand, led her
 forth, and before the eyes of all his company, and as many other
 folk as were there, caused her to strip naked, and let bring the
 garments that he had had fashioned for her, and had her forthwith
 arrayed therein, and upon her unkempt head let set a crown;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100020"/>and
 then, while all wondered: <q>Gentlemen,</q> quoth he, <q>this is she
 whom I purpose to make my wife, so she be minded to have me for
 husband.</q> Then, she standing abashed and astonied, he turned to
 her, saying: <q><persName>Griselda</persName>, wilt thou have me for thy husband?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100021"/>To
 whom: <q>Ay, my lord,</q> answered she.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100022"/><q>And I will have thee to
 wife,</q> said he, and married her before them all. And having set her
 upon a palfrey, he brought her home with pomp.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100023"/>The wedding was fair and stately, and had he married a daughter
 of the King of <placeName>France</placeName>, the feast could not have been more splendid.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100024"/>It seemed as if, with the change of her garb, the bride had acquired
 a new dignity of mind and mien. She was, as we have said, fair of
 form and feature; and therewithal she was now grown so engaging
 and gracious and debonair, that she shewed no longer as the shepherdess,
 and the daughter of Giannucolo, but as the daughter of some noble
 lord, insomuch that she caused as many as had known her before to
 marvel. Moreover, she was so obedient and devoted to her husband,
 that he deemed himself the happiest and luckiest man in the world.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100025"/>And likewise so gracious and kindly was she to her husband's vassals,
 that there was none of them but loved her more dearly than himself,
 and was zealous to do her honour, and prayed for her welfare and
 prosperity and aggrandisement, and instead of, as erstwhile, saying
 that Gualtieri had done foolishly to take her to wife, now averred
 that he had not his like in the world for wisdom and discernment,
 for that, save to him, her noble qualities would ever have remained
 hidden under her sorry apparel and the garb of the peasant girl.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100026"/>And in short she so comported herself as in no long time to bring it
 to pass that, not only in the marquisate, but far and wide besides, her
 virtues and her admirable conversation were matter of common talk,
 and, if aught had been said to the disadvantage of her husband, when
 he married her, the judgment was now altogether to the contrary
 effect.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100027"/>She had not been long with Gualtieri before she conceived; and
 <pb n="391"/>in due time she was delivered of a girl; whereat Gualtieri made great
 cheer. But, soon after, a strange humour took possession of him,
 to wit, to put her patience to the proof by prolonged and intolerable
 hard usage; wherefore he began by afflicting her with his gibes,
 putting on a vexed air, and telling her that his vassals were most
 sorely dissatisfied with her by reason of her base condition, and all
 the more so since they saw that she was a mother, and that they
 did nought but most ruefully murmur at the birth of a daughter.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100028"/>Whereto <persName>Griselda</persName>, without the least change of countenance or sign
 of discomposure, made answer: <q>My lord, do with me as thou
 mayst deem best for thine own honour and comfort, for well I wot
 that I am of less account than they, and unworthy of this honourable
 estate to which of thy courtesy thou hast advanced me.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100029"/>By which
 answer Gualtieri was well pleased, witting that she was in no degree
 puffed up with pride by his, or any other's, honourable entreatment
 of her.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100030"/>A while afterwards, having in general terms given his wife
 to understand that the vassals could not endure her daughter, he sent
 her a message by a servant. So the servant came, and: <q>Madam,</q>
 quoth he with a most dolorous mien, <q>so I value my life, I must
 needs do my lord's bidding. He has bidden me take your daughter
 and . . .</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100031"/>He said no more, but the lady by what she heard, and
 read in his face, and remembered of her husband's words, understood
 that he was bidden to put the child to death. Whereupon she
 presently took the child from the cradle, and having kissed and blessed
 her, albeit she was very sore at heart, she changed not countenance,
 but placed it in the servant's arms, saying:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100032"/><q>See that thou leave
 nought undone that my lord and thine has charged thee to do, but
 leave her not so that the beasts and the birds devour her, unless he
 have so bidden thee.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100033"/>So the servant took the child, and told
 Gualtieri what the lady had said; and Gualtieri, marvelling at her
 constancy, sent him with the child to <placeName>Bologna</placeName>, to one of his kinswomen,
 whom he besought to rear and educate the child with all
 care, but never to let it be known whose child she was.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100034"/>Soon after it befell that the lady again conceived, and in due
 time was delivered of a son, whereat Gualtieri was overjoyed. But,
 not content with what he had done, he now even more poignantly
 afflicted the lady; and one day with a ruffled mien:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100035"/><q>Wife,</q>
 quoth he, <q>since thou gavest birth to this boy, I may on no wise live
 <pb n="392"/>in peace with my vassals, so bitterly do they reproach me that a
 grandson of Giannucolo is to succeed me as their lord; and therefore I
 fear that, so I be not minded to be sent a packing hence, I must even
 do herein as I did before, and in the end put thee away, and take
 another wife.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100036"/>The lady heard him patiently, and answered only:
 <q>My lord, study how thou mayst content thee and best please thyself,
 and waste no thought upon me, for there is nought I desire save in so
 far as I know that 'tis thy pleasure.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100037"/>Not many days after, Gualtieri,
 in like manner as he had sent for the daughter, sent for the son, and
 having made a shew of putting him to death, provided for his, as for
 the girl's, nurture at <placeName>Bologna</placeName>.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100038"/>Whereat the lady shewed no more
 discomposure of countenance or speech than at the loss of her
 daughter: which Gualtieri found passing strange, and inly affirmed
 that there was never another woman in the world that would have
 so done. And but that he had marked that she was most tenderly
 affectionate towards her children, while 'twas well pleasing to him, he
 had supposed that she was tired of them, whereas he knew that 'twas
 of her discretion that she so did.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100039"/>His vassals, who believed that he had
 put the children to death, held him mightily to blame for his cruelty,
 and felt the utmost compassion for the lady. She, however, said
 never aught to the ladies that condoled with her on the death of her
 children, but that the pleasure of him that had begotten them was
 her pleasure likewise.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100040"/>Years not a few had passed since the girl's birth, when Gualtieri
 at length deemed the time come to put his wife's patience to the
 final proof. Accordingly, in the presence of a great company of his
 vassals he declared that on no wise might he longer brook to have
 <persName>Griselda</persName> to wife, that he confessed that in taking her he had done a
 sorry thing and the act of a stripling, and that he therefore meant to
 do what he could to procure the Pope's dispensation to put <persName>Griselda</persName>
 away, and take another wife: for which cause being much upbraided
 by many worthy men, he made no other answer but only that needs
 must it so be.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100041"/>Whereof the lady being apprised, and now deeming
 that she must look to go back to her father's house, and perchance
 tend the sheep, as she had aforetime, and see him, to whom she
 was utterly devoted, engrossed by another woman, did inly bewail
 herself right sorely: but still with the same composed mien with
 which she had borne Fortune's former buffets, she set herself to endure
 <pb n="393"/>this last outrage.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100042"/>Nor was it long before Gualtieri by counterfeit
 letters, which he caused to be sent to him from <placeName>Rome</placeName>, made his
 vassals believe that the Pope had thereby given him a dispensation to
 put <persName>Griselda</persName> away, and take another wife. Wherefore, having caused
 her to be brought before him, he said to her in the presence of not a
 few:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100043"/><q>Wife, by license granted me by the Pope, I am now free
 to put thee away, and take another wife; and, for that my forbears
 have always been great gentlemen and lords of these parts, whereas
 thine have ever been husbandmen, I purpose that thou go back
 to Giannucolo's house with the dowry that thou broughtest me;
 whereupon I shall bring home a lady that I have found, and who is
 meet to be my wife.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100044"/>'Twas not without travail most grievous that the lady, as she
 heard this announcement, got the better of her woman's nature, and
 suppressing her tears, made answer: <q>My lord, I ever knew that
 my low degree was on no wise congruous with your nobility, and
 acknowledged that the rank I had with you was of your and God's
 bestowal, nor did I ever make as if it were mine by gift, or so esteem
 it, but still accounted it as a loan. 'Tis your pleasure to recall it,
 and therefore it should be, and is, my pleasure to render it up to you.
 So, here is your ring, with which you espoused me; take it back.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100045"/>You bid me take with me the dowry that I brought you; which to
 do will require neither paymaster on your part nor purse nor packhorse
 on mine; for I am not unmindful that naked was I when you
 first had me. And if you deem it seemly that that body in which I
 have borne children, by you begotten, be beheld of all, naked will I
 depart; but yet, I pray you, be pleased, in guerdon of the virginity
 that I brought you and take not away, to suffer me to bear hence
 upon my back a single shift--I crave no more--besides my dowry.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100046"/>There was nought of which Gualtieri was so fain as to weep; but
 yet, setting his face as a flint, he made answer: <q>I allow thee a
 shift to thy back; so get thee hence.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100047"/>All that stood by besought
 him to give her a robe, that she, who had been his wife for thirteen
 years and more, might not be seen to quit his house in so sorry and
 shameful a plight, having nought on her but a shift. But their
 entreaties went for nothing: the lady in her shift, and barefoot and
 bareheaded, having bade them adieu, departed the house, and went
 back to her father amid the tears and lamentations of all that saw
 <pb n="394"/>her.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100048"/>Giannucolo, who had ever deemed it a thing incredible
 that Gualtieri should keep his daughter to wife, and had looked
 for this to happen every day, and had kept the clothes that she
 had put off on the morning that Gualtieri had wedded her, now
 brought them to her; and she, having resumed them, applied herself
 to the petty drudgery of her father's house, as she had been wont,
 enduring with fortitude this cruel visitation of adverse Fortune.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100049"/>Now no sooner had Gualtieri dismissed <persName>Griselda</persName>, than he gave his
 vassals to understand that he had taken to wife a daughter of one of
 the Counts of Panago. He accordingly made great preparations as
 for the nuptials, during which he sent for <persName>Griselda</persName>. To whom,
 being come, quoth he:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100050"/><q>I am bringing hither my new bride, and
 in this her first home-coming I purpose to shew her honour; and
 thou knowest that women I have none in the house that know
 how to set chambers in due order, or attend to the many other
 matters that so joyful an event requires; wherefore do thou, that
 understandest these things better than another, see to all that needs
 be done, and bid hither such ladies as thou mayst see fit, and
 receive them, as if thou wert the lady of the house, and then,
 when the nuptials are ended, thou mayst go back to thy cottage.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100051"/>Albeit each of these words pierced <persName>Griselda</persName>'s heart like a knife,
 for that, in resigning her good fortune, she had not been able to
 renounce the love she bore Gualtieri, nevertheless: <q>My lord,</q> she
 made answer, <q>I am ready and prompt to do your pleasure.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100052"/>And
 so, clad in her sorry garments of coarse romagnole, she entered the
 house, which, but a little before, she had quitted in her shift, and
 addressed her to sweep the chambers, and arrange arras and cushions
 in the halls, and make ready the kitchen, and set her hand to everything,
 as if she had been a paltry serving-wench: nor did she rest
 until she had brought all into such meet and seemly trim as the
 occasion demanded.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100053"/>This done, she invited in Gualtieri's name all
 the ladies of those parts to be present at his nuptials, and awaited the
 event. The day being come, still wearing her sorry weeds, but in
 heart and soul and mien the lady, she received the ladies as they
 came, and gave each a gladsome greeting.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100054"/>Now Gualtieri, as we said, had caused his children to be carefully
 nurtured and brought up by a kinswoman of his at <placeName>Bologna</placeName>, which
 kinswoman was married into the family of the Counts of Panago;
 <pb n="395"/>and, the girl being now twelve years old, and the loveliest creature
 that ever was seen, and the boy being about six years old, he had
 sent word to his kinswoman's husband at <placeName>Bologna</placeName>, praying him to
 be pleased to come with this girl and boy of his to <placeName>Saluzzo</placeName>, and to
 see that he brought a goodly and honourable company with him,
 and to give all to understand that he brought the girl to him to
 wife, and on no wisè to disclose to any, who she really was.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100055"/>The
 gentleman did as the Marquis bade him, and within a few days of
 his setting forth arrived at <placeName>Saluzzo</placeName> about breakfast-time with the
 girl, and her brother, and a noble company, and found all the folk of
 those parts, and much people besides, gathered there in expectation
 of Gualtieri's new bride.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100056"/>Who, being received by the ladies, was
 no sooner come into the hall, where the tables were set, than <persName>Griselda</persName>
 advanced to meet her, saying with hearty cheer: <q>Welcome, my
 lady.</q> So the ladies, who had with much instance, but in vain, besought
 Gualtieri, either to let <persName>Griselda</persName> keep in another room, or at any
 rate to furnish her with one of the robes that had been hers, that she
 might not present herself in such a sorry guise before the strangers,
 sate down to table; and the service being begun,  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100057"/>the eyes of all were
 set on the girl, and every one said that Gualtieri had made a good
 exchange, and <persName>Griselda</persName> joined with the rest in greatly commending
 her, and also her little brother.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100058"/>And now Gualtieri, sated at last
 with all that he had seen of his wife's patience, marking that this
 new and strange turn made not the least alteration in her demeanour,
 and being well assured that 'twas not due to apathy, for he knew her
 to be of excellent understanding, deemed it time to relieve her
 of the suffering which he judged her to dissemble under a resolute
 front; and so, having called her to him in presence of them all, he
 said with a smile: <q>And what thinkst thou of our bride?</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100059"/><q>My lord,</q> replied <persName>Griselda</persName>, <q>I think mighty well of her; and if
 she be but as discreet as she is fair--and so I deem her--I make no
 doubt but you may reckon to lead with her a life of incomparable
 felicity; but with all earnestness I entreat you, that you spare her
 those tribulations which you did once inflict upon another that was
 yours, for I scarce think she would be able to bear them, as well
 because she is younger, as for that she has been delicately nurtured,
 whereas that other had known no respite of hardship since she was
 but a little child.</q><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100060"/>Marking that she made no doubt but that the
 <pb n="396"/>girl was to be his wife, and yet spoke never a whit the less sweetly,
 Gualtieri caused her to sit down beside him, and:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100061"/><q><persName>Griselda</persName>,</q>
 said he, <q>'tis now time that thou see the reward of thy long patience,
 and that those, who have deemed me cruel and unjust and insensate,
 should know that what I did was done of purpose aforethought, for
 that I was minded to give both thee and them a lesson, that thou
 mightst learn to be a wife, and they in like manner might learn how
 to take and keep a wife, and that I might beget me perpetual peace
 with thee for the rest of my life; whereof being in great fear, when
 I came to take a wife, lest I should be disappointed, I therefore, to
 put the matter to the proof, did, and how sorely thou knowest, harass
 and afflict thee.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100062"/>And since I never knew thee either by deed or by
 word to deviate from my will, I now, deeming myself to have of
 thee that assurance of happiness which I desired, am minded to
 restore to thee at once all that, step by step, I took from thee, and
 by extremity of joy to compensate the tribulations that I inflicted
 on thee.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100063"/>Receive, then, this girl, whom thou supposest to be my
 bride, and her brother, with glad heart, as thy children and mine.
 These are they, whom by thee and many another it has long been
 supposed that I did ruthlessly to death, and I am thy husband, that
 loves thee more dearly than aught else, deeming that other there is

 wept for joy, they rose and hied them there where sate the daughter,
 all astonied to hear the news, whom, as also her brother, they tenderly
 embraced, and explained to them, and many others that stood
 by, the whole mystery.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100065"/>Whereat the ladies, transported with delight,
 rose from table and betook them with <persName>Griselda</persName> to a chamber,
 and, with better omen, divested her of her sorry garb, and arrayed
 her in one of her own robes of state; and so, in guise of a lady
 (howbeit in her rags she had shewed as no less) they led her back
 into the hall.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100066"/>Wondrous was the cheer which there they made
 with the children; and, all overjoyed at the event, they revelled and
 made merry amain, and prolonged the festivities for several days;
 and very discreet they pronounced Gualtieri, albeit they censured as
 intolerably harsh the probation to which he had subjected <persName>Griselda</persName>,
 and most discreet beyond all compare they accounted <persName>Griselda</persName>.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100067"/>Some days after, the Count of Panago returned to <placeName>Bologna</placeName>, and
 <pb n="397"/>Gualtieri took Giannucolo from his husbandry, and established him
 in honour as his father-in-law, wherein to his great solace he lived
 for the rest of his days. Gualtieri himself, having mated his daughter
 with a husband of high degree, lived long and happily thereafter with
 <persName>Griselda</persName>, to whom he ever paid all honour.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100068"/>Now what shall we say in this case but that even into the cots of
 the poor the heavens let fall at times spirits divine, as into the palaces
 of kings souls that are fitter to tend hogs than to exercise lordship over
 men? Who but <persName>Griselda</persName> had been able, with a countenance not only
 tearless, but cheerful, to endure the hard and unheard-of trials to which
 Gualtieri subjected her?  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00100069"/>Who perhaps might have deemed himself
 to have made no bad investment, had he chanced upon one, who,
 having been turned out of his house in her shift, had found means so
 to dust the pelisse of another as to get herself thereby a fine robe.</p></div><!--***********************************Conclusion*********************************--><div type="conclusion" corresp="d10conclu"><head>Conclusion</head><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00970001"/>So ended <persName>Dioneo</persName>'s story, whereof the ladies, diversely inclining,
 one to censure where another found matter for commendation, had
 discoursed not a little, when the king, having glanced at the sky,
 and marked that the sun was now low, insomuch that 'twas nigh the
 vesper hour, still keeping his seat, thus began:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00970002"/><q>Exquisite my
 ladies, as, methinks, you wot, 'tis not only in minding them of
 the past and apprehending the present that the wit of mortals
 consists; but by one means or the other to be able to foresee the
 future is by the sages accounted the height of wisdom.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00970003"/>Now,
 to-morrow, as you know, 'twill be fifteen days since, in quest of
 recreation and for the conservation of our health and life, we, shunning
 the dismal and dolorous and afflicting spectacles that have ceased
 not in our city since this season of pestilence began, took our departure
 from <placeName>Florence</placeName>.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00970004"/>Wherein, to my thinking, we have done
 nought that was not seemly; for, if I have duly used my powers of
 observation, albeit some gay stories, and of a kind to stimulate
 concupiscence,
 have here been told, and we have daily known no lack
 of dainty dishes and good wine, nor yet of music and song, things,
 one and all, apt to incite weak minds to that which is not seemly,
 neither on your part, nor on ours, have I marked deed or word, or
 aught of any kind, that called for reprehension;  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00970005"/>but, by what I have
 seen and heard, seemliness and the sweet intimacy of brothers and
 sisters have ever reigned among us. Which, assuredly, for the honour
 and advantage which you and I have had thereof, is most grateful to
 <pb n="398"/>me.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00970006"/>Wherefore, lest too long continuance in this way of life might
 beget some occasion of weariness, and that no man may be able to
 misconstrue our too long abidance here, and as we have all of us had
 our day's share of the honour which still remains in me, I should
 deem it meet, so you be of like mind, that we now go back whence
 we came:  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00970007"/>and that the rather that our company, the bruit whereof
 has already reached divers others that are in our neighbourhood, might
 be so increased that all our pleasure would be destroyed. And so, if
 my counsel meet with your approval, I will keep the crown I have
 received of you until our departure, which, I purpose, shall be tomorrow
 morning. Should you decide otherwise, I have already
 determined whom to crown for the ensuing day.</q></p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00970008"/>Much debate ensued among the ladies and young men; but in
 the end they approved the king's proposal as expedient and seemly;
 and resolved to do even as he had said. The king therefore
 summoned the seneschal; and having conferred with him of the
 order he was to observe on the morrow, he dismissed the company
 until supper-time.  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00970009"/>So, the king being risen, the ladies and the rest
 likewise rose, and betook them, as they were wont, to their several
 diversions. Supper-time being come, they supped with exceeding
 great delight. Which done, they addressed them to song and music
 and dancing; and, while <persName>Lauretta</persName> was leading a dance, the king bade
 <persName>Fiammetta</persName> give them a song; whereupon <persName>Fiammetta</persName> right debonairly
 sang on this wise:</p><floatingText type="song"><body><lg><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00970010"/><l>So came but Love, and brought no jealousy,</l><l>So blithe, I wot, as I,</l><l>Dame were there none, be she whoe'er she be.</l></lg><lg><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00970011"/><l>If youth's fresh, lusty pride</l><l>May lady of her lover well content,</l><l>Or valour's just renown,</l><l>Hardihood, prowess tried,</l><l>Wit, noble mien, discourse most excellent,</l><l>And of all grace the crown;</l><l>That she am I, who, fain for love to swoun,</l><l>There where my hope doth lie</l><l>These several virtues all conjoined do see.</l></lg><pb n="399"/><lg><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00970012"/><l>But, for that I less wise</l><l>Than me no whit do other dames discern,</l><l>Trembling with sore dismay,</l><l>I still the worst surmise,</l><l>Deeming their hearts with the same flame to burn</l><l>That of mine maketh prey:</l><l>Wherefore of him that is my hope's one stay</l><l>Disconsolate I sigh,</l><l>Yea mightily, and daily do me dree.</l></lg><lg><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00970013"/><l>If but my lord as true</l><l>As worthy to be loved I might approve,</l><l>I were not jealous then:</l><l>But, for that charmer new</l><l>Doth all too often gallant lure to love,</l><l>Forsworn I hold all men,</l><l>And sick at heart I am, of death full fain;</l><l>Nor lady doth him eye,</l><l>But I do quake, lest she him wrest from me.</l></lg><lg><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00970014"/><l>'Fore God, then, let each she</l><l>List to my prayer, nor e'er in my despite</l><l>Such grievous wrong essay;</l><l>For should there any be</l><l>That by or speech or mien's allurements light</l><l>Of him to rob me may</l><l>Study or plot, I, witting, shall find way,</l><l>My beauty it aby!</l><l>To cause her sore lament such frenesie.</l></lg></body></floatingText><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00970015"/>As soon as <persName>Fiammetta</persName> had ended her song, <persName>Dioneo</persName>, who was
 beside her, said with a laugh: <q>Madam, 'twould be a great courtesy
 on your part to do all ladies to wit, who he is, that he be not stolen
 from you in ignorance, seeing that you threaten such dire resentment.</q>
 Several other songs followed; and it being then nigh upon
 midnight, all, as the king was pleased to order, betook them to rest.
  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p00970016"/>With the first light of the new day they rose, and, the seneschal
 having already conveyed thence all their chattels, they, following the
 lead of their discreet king, hied them back to <placeName>Florence</placeName>; and in Santa
 Maria Novella, whence they had set forth, the three young men
 <pb n="400"/>took leave of the seven ladies, and departed to find other diversions
 elsewhere, while the ladies in due time repaired to their homes.</p></div></div><!--***********--><div type="epilogue" corresp="epilogue"><pb n="400"/><head>The Author's Epilogue</head><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p11980001"/><!--(sc)-->Most<!--(/sc)--> noble damsels, for whose solace I
	  addressed me to this long
	      and toilsome task, meseems that, aided by the Divine grace, the
	  bestowal whereof I impute to the efficacy of your pious prayers, and
	  in no wise to merits of mine, I have now brought this work to the
	  full and perfect consummation which in the outset thereof I promised
	  you. Wherefore, it but remains for me to render, first to God, and
	  then to you, my thanks, and so to give a rest to my pen and weary
	  hand. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p11980002"/>But this I purpose not to allow them, until, briefly, as to
	  questions tacitly mooted--for well assured I am that these stories
	  have no especial privilege above any others, nay, I forget not that at
	  the beginning of the Fourth Day I have made the same plain--I
	  shall have answered certain trifling objections that one of you, maybe,
	  or some other, might advance. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p11980003"/>Peradventure, then, some of you will
	  be found to say that I have used excessive license in the writing
	  of these stories, in that I have caused ladies at times to tell, and
	  oftentimes to list, matters that, whether to tell or to list, do not well
	  beseem virtuous women. The which I deny, for that there is none
	  of these stories so unseemly, but that it may without offence be told
	  by any one, if but seemly words be used; which rule, methinks, has
	  here been very well observed. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p11980004"/>But assume we that 'tis even so (for
	  with you I am not minded to engage in argument, witting that you
	  would vanquish me), then, I say that for answer why I have so done,
	  reasons many come very readily to hand. In the first place, if aught
	  of the kind in any of these stories there be, 'twas but such as was
	  demanded by the character of the stories, which let but any person
	  of sound judgment scan with the eye of reason, and 'twill be abundantly
	  manifest that, unless I had been minded to deform them, they
	  could not have been otherwise recounted. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p11980005"/>And if, perchance, they
	  do, after all, contain here and there a trifling indiscretion of speech,
	  such as might ill sort with one of your precious prudes, who weigh
	  <pb n="401"/>words rather than deeds, and are more concerned to appear, than to
	  be, good, I say that so to write was as permissible to me, as 'tis to
	  men and women at large in their converse to make use of such terms
	      as <!--(i)-->hole<!--(/i)-->, and <!--(i)-->pin<!--(/i)-->, and <!--(i)-->mortar<!--(/i)-->, and <!--(i)-->pestle<!--(/i)-->, and
	  <!--(i)-->sausage<!--(/i)-->, and <!--(i)-->polony<!--(/i)-->, and
	  plenty more besides of a like sort. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p11980006"/>And therewithal privilege no
	  less should be allowed to my pen than to the pencil of the painter,
	  who without incurring any, or at least any just, censure, not only
	  will depict St. Michael smiting the serpent, or St. George the
	  dragon, with sword or lance at his discretion; but male he paints us
	      Christ, and female Eve, and His feet that for the salvation of our
	  race willed to die upon the cross he fastens thereto, now with one,
	  now with two nails.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p11980007"/>Moreover, 'tis patent to all that 'twas not in the Church, of
	  matters whereto pertaining 'tis meet we speak with all purity of
	  heart and seemliness of phrase, albeit among her histories there are
	  to be found not a few that will ill compare with my writings; nor
	  yet in the schools of the philosophers, where, as much as anywhere,
	  seemliness is demanded, nor in any place where clergy or philosophers
	  congregate, but in gardens, in pleasaunces, and among folk,
	  young indeed, but not so young as to be seducible by stories, and at
	  a time when, if so one might save one's life, the most sedate might
	  without disgrace walk abroad with his breeches for headgear, that
	  these stories were told. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p11980008"/>Which stories, such as they are, may, like
	  all things else, be baneful or profitable according to the quality
	  of the hearer. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p11980009"/>Who knows not that wine is, as <persName>Cinciglione</persName> and
	  <persName>Scolaio</persName><note>Noted topers of the day.</note> and many another aver, an
	  excellent thing for the living
	  creature, and yet noxious to the fevered patient? Are we, for the
	  mischief it does to the fever-stricken, to say that 'tis a bad thing?
	  Who knows not that fire is most serviceable, nay, necessary, to
	  mortals? Are we to say that, because it burns houses and villages
	  and cities, it is a bad thing? <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p11980010"/>Arms, in like manner, are the safeguard
	  of those that desire to live in peace, and also by them are men
	  not seldom maliciously slain, albeit the malice is not in them, but in
	  those that use them for a malicious purpose. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p11980011"/>Corrupt mind did never
	  yet understand any word in a wholesome sense; and as such a mind
	  has no profit of seemly words, so such as are scarce seemly may as
	  <pb n="402"/>little avail to contaminate a healthy mind as mud the radiance of
	  the sun, or the deformities of earth the splendours of the heavens.
	  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p11980012"/>What books, what words, what letters, are more sacred, more excellent,
	  more venerable, than those of Holy Writ? And yet there
	  have been not a few that, perversely construing them, have brought
	  themselves and others to perdition. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p11980013"/>Everything is in itself good for
	  somewhat, and being put to a bad purpose, may work manifold mischief.
	  And so, I say, it is with my stories. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p11980014"/>If any man shall be
	  minded to draw from them matters of evil tendency or consequence,
	  they will not gainsay him, if, perchance, such matters there be in
	  them, nor will such matters fail to be found in them, if they be
	  wrested and distorted. Nor, if any shall seek profit and reward in
	  them, will they deny him the same; and censured or accounted as
	  less than profitable and seemly they can never be, if the times or the
	  persons when and by whom they are read be such as when they
	  were recounted. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p11980015"/>If any lady must needs say paternosters or make
	  cakes or tarts for her holy father, let her leave them alone; there is
	  none after whom they will run a begging to be read: howbeit, there
	  are little matters that even the beguines tell, ay, and do, now and
	  again.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p11980016"/>In like manner there will be some who will say that there are
	  stories here which 'twere better far had been omitted. Granted;
	  but 'twas neither in my power, nor did it behove me, to write any
	  but such stories as were narrated; wherefore, 'twas for those by
	  whom they were told to have a care that they were proper; in
	  which case they would have been no less so as I wrote them. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p11980017"/>But,
	  assuming that I not only wrote but invented the stories, as I did not,
	  I say that I should take no shame to myself that they were not all
	  proper; seeing that artist there is none to be found, save God, that
	  does all things well and perfectly. And Charlemagne, albeit he
	  created the Paladins, wist not how to make them in such numbers
	  as to form an army of them alone. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p11980018"/>It must needs be that in the
	  multitude of things there be found diversities of quality. No field
	  was ever so well tilled but that here and there nettle, or thistle, or
	  brier would be found in it amid the goodlier growths. Whereto I
	  may add that, having to address me to young and unlearned ladies,
	  as you for the most part are, I should have done foolishly, had I
	  gone about searching and swinking to find matters very exquisite,
	  <pb n="403"/>and been sedulous to speak with great precision. 
	  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p11980019"/>However, whoso
	  goes a reading among these stories, let him pass over those that vex
	  him, and read those that please him. That none may be misled,
	  each bears on its brow the epitome of that which it hides within its
	  bosom.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p11980020"/>Again, I doubt not there will be such as will say that some of
	  the stories are too long. To whom, once more, I answer, that
	  whoso has aught else to do would be foolish to read them, albeit
	  they were short. And though, now that I approach the end of my
	  labours, 'tis long since I began to write, I am not, therefore, oblivious
	  that 'twas to none but leisured ladies that I made proffer of my
	  pains; nor can aught be long to him that reads but to pass the time,
	  so only he thereby accomplish his purpose. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p11980021"/>Succinctness were
	  rather to be desired by students, who are at pains not merely to pass,
	  but usefully to employ, their time, than by you, who have as much
	  time at your disposal as you spend not in amorous delights. Besides
	  which, as none of you goes either to Athens, or to <placeName>Bologna</placeName>, or to
	  <placeName>Paris</placeName> to study, 'tis meet that what is meant for you should be more
	  diffuse than what is to be read by those whose minds have been
	  refined by scholarly pursuits.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p11980022"/>Nor make I any doubt but there are yet others who will say that
	  the said stories are too full of jests and merry conceits, and that it ill
	  beseems a man of weight and gravity to have written on such wise.
	  To these I am bound to render, and do render, my thanks, for that,
	  prompted by well-meant zeal, they have so tender a regard to my
	  reputation. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p11980023"/>But to that, which they urge against me, I reply after
	  this sort: That I am of weight I acknowledge, having been often
	  weighed in my time; wherefore, in answer to the fair that have not
	  weighed me, I affirm that I am not of gravity; on the contrary I am
	  so light that I float on the surface of the water; and considering
	  that the sermons which the friars make, when they would chide folk
	  for their sins, are to-day, for the most part, full of jests and merry
	  conceits, and drolleries, I deemed that the like stuff would not ill
	  beseem my stories, written, as they were, to banish women's dumps.
	  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p11980024"/>However, if thereby they should laugh too much, they may be
	  readily cured thereof by the Lament of Jeremiah, the Passion of the
	  Saviour, or the Complaint of the Magdalen.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p11980025"/>And who shall question but that yet others there are who will
	  <pb n="404"/>say that I have an evil tongue and venomous, because here and there
	  I tell the truth about the friars? <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p11980026"/>Now for them that so say there
	  is forgiveness, for that 'tis not to be believed but that they have just
	  cause; seeing that the friars are good folk, and eschew hardship for
	  the love of God, and grind intermittently, and never blab; and, were
	  they not all a trifle malodorous, intercourse with them would be
	  much more agreeable. <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p11980027"/>Nevertheless, I acknowledge that the things
	  of this world have no stability, but are ever undergoing change; and
	  this may have befallen my tongue, albeit, no great while ago, one of
	  my fair neighbours--for in what pertains to myself I trust not my
	  own judgment, but forgo it to the best of my power--told me 'twas
	  the goodliest and sweetest tongue in the world; and in sooth, when
	  this occurred, few of the said stories were yet to write; 
	  <milestone unit="locus" corresp="p11980028"/>nor, for that
	  those who so tax me do it despitefully, am I minded to vouchsafe
	  them any further answer.</p><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p11980029"/>So, then, be every lady at liberty to say and believe whatever she
	  may think fit: but 'tis now time for me to bring these remarks to a
	  close, with humble thanks to Him, by whose help and guidance I,
	  after so long travail, have been brought to the desired goal. And
	  may you, sweet my ladies, rest ever in His grace and peace; and
	  be not unmindful of me, if, peradventure, any of you may, in any
	  measure, have been profited by reading these stories.</p></div><div type="trailer"><p><milestone unit="locus" corresp="p11980030"/><!--(i)-->Endeth here the tenth and last day of the book called
