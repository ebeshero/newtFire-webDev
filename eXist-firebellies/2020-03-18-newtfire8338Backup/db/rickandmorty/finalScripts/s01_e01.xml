                    flying vehicle, Morty? I built it outta stuff I found in the garage.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Morty</speaker>
                <p> Yeah, Rick... I-it's great. Is this the surprise?</p>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Rick</speaker>
                <p> Morty. I had to... I had to do it. I had— I had to— I had to make a bomb, Morty.
                    I had to create a bomb.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Morty</speaker>
                <p> What?! A bomb?!</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Rick</speaker>
                <p> We're gonna drop it down there just get a whole fresh start, Morty. Create a
                    whole fresh start.</p>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Rick</speaker>
                <p> Come on, Morty. Just take it easy, Morty. It's gonna be good. Right now, we're
                    gonna go pick up your little friend Jessica.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Morty</speaker>
                <p> Jessica? From my math class?</p>

                <p>
                    <stage>puts an arm around Morty’s shoulders.</stage> When I drop the bomb you
                    know, I want you to have somebody, you know? I want you to have the thing. I'm
                    gonna make it like a new Adam and Eve, and you're gonna be Adam.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>

                <p> And Jessica's gonna be Eve.</p>

                <p> And so that's the surprise, Morty.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Morty</speaker>
                <p> No, you can't! <stage>shoves Rick away.</stage> Jessica doesn't even know I
                    exist! But—but, but forget about that, because you can't blow up humanity!</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Rick</speaker>
                <p> I-I get what you're trying to say, Morty. Listen, I'm not... <stage>spills
                        alcohol down his shirt.</stage> You don't got... Y-you don’t gotta worry
                    about me trying to fool around with Jessica or mess around with Jessica or
                    anything. I'm not that kind of guy, Morty.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Morty</speaker>
                <p> What are you talking about, Rick?</p>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Rick</speaker>
                <p> You-you don't have to worry about me getting with Jessica or anything.
                    Sh-sh-she— she, she, she's all for you, Morty.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Morty</speaker>
                <p> I don't care about Jessica! Y-Yyyyyyyyyyou—</p>

                        backseat) Let's forget the girl altogether. She, she's probably nothing but
                        trouble, anyways. (presses a button.</stage></p>

                        much why don’t you marry it? (pushes Morty) What are you, crazy? Alright,
                        alright, Morty. (pushes Morty off of him.</stage></p>

                <p> I wasn't kissing a pillow, mom. I just I didn't get a lot of sleep last night.
                    Maybe my dreams were just too loud or something.</p>

                    talking about? What respect is due? How is my son supposed to pass his classes
                    if you keep dragging him off for high-concept Sci-Fi rigamarole?</p>

                <p> Listen, Jerry. I-I-I don't want to overstep my bounds or anything. It's your
                    house. It's your world. You're a real Julius Caesar but I'll tell you
                    something—tell you how I feel about school, Jerry. It's a waste of time.
                        <stage>Jerry stares incredulously at him) Buncha people running around,
                        bumping into each other. G-guy up front says, "two plus two." The people in
                        the back say, "four." Then the—then the bell rings, and they give you a
                        carton of milk and a piece of paper that says you can go take a dump or
                        something. I mean, it's not a place for smart people, Jerry. And I know
                        that's not a popular opinion, but it's my two cents on the issue. (wipes his
                        mouth and gets up, stopping behind Beth and putting a hand on her shoulder)
                        This was a good breakfast, Beth. You really made the crap out of those eggs.
                        I wish your mother was here to eat them. (Rick gives Beth a kiss and walks

                <speaker>Mr. Goldenfold</speaker>
                <p>Now, look, we're gonna be dealing with some real serious stuff today. You might
                    have heard of it. It's called math? And without it, none of us would even exist,
                    so let's jump right in. Two plus two.</p>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Morty</speaker>
                <p> Jessica. <stage>Jessica hears Morty and looks back, confused, not sure who’s
                        saying her name.</stage></p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Mr. Goldenfold</speaker>
                <p>Okay, good. It's time for the quiz.</p>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Mr. Goldenfold</speaker>
                <p>Yeah, you know what?! Aw, too bad! Tough! First row, take one. Pass it back for
                    me. The stakes are high in this room. <stage>Morty stares at the quiz; the
                        numbers on the quiz jumble together as Morty falls asleep</stage> There's
                    crucial things happening here every day. People getting smarter. Some of y'all
                    getting dumber. Some of y'all ain't gonna see 3:00. <stage>Morty falls into a
                        dream world filled with large number-shaped blocks; Jessica steps out from
                        behind some of the numbers.</stage></p>

            <sp>

                <p> Whoa! Hi, Jessica.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Jessica</speaker>
                <p> Can I show these to you? <stage>Jessica opens her shirt, showing Morty her
                        breasts.</stage></p>
            </sp>

            <sp>

                <p> Wow. Th-they're both great. Thank you!</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Jessica</speaker>
                <p> You know what I named these? My little Morties.</p>

                    <stage>rubs the back of his neck.</stage> Uh, that's flattering... and a little
                    weird.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Jessica</speaker>
                <p> Do you know what I want you to do with them?</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Morty</speaker>
                <p> Rename them?</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Jessica</speaker>
                <p> Squeeze them. Manhandle them. Give them the business. See if you can shuffle
                    them. I mean, really get in there and knock them around. No wrong answers.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Morty</speaker>
                <p> Wow. Well, okay, Jessica. L-let's give this a shot. <stage>Morty grabs her
                        breasts and starts fondling her.</stage></p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Jessica</speaker>
                <p> Mm. Oh, Morty. What are you doing to me?</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Morty</speaker>
                <p> Uh, I-I'm just doing my best. <stage>in real life, class has ended and Morty is
                        fondling Mr. Goldenfold.</stage></p>
            </sp>

            <sp>

                <p>Five more minutes of this, and I'm gonna get mad. <stage>leans back and bites his

                <speaker>Morty</speaker>
                <p> Oh, geez, Frank. I don't know if a knife is necessary. I mean, you know, y-you
                    kind of had things handled without it.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Frank</speaker>
                <p> You telling me how to bully now? Big mistake, Morty and now I'm gonna cut you,
                    'cause my family's rich. <stage>Frank suddenly freezes and Rick steps out from

            <sp>

                <p> There you are, Morty. Listen to me. I got an errand to run in a whole different

            <sp>
                <speaker>Rick</speaker>
                <p> It's pretty obvious, Morty. I froze him. Now listen I need your help, Morty. I
                    mean, we got we got to get get the hell out of here and go take care of
                    business. <stage>burps.</stage> It's important. Come on, Morty.</p>

                <p> Do you have any concept of how much higher the stakes get out there, Morty? What
                    do you think I can just do it all by myself? Come on!</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Morty</speaker>
                <p> Aw, geez. Okay. I guess I can skip history. What about Frank? I mean, shouldn't
                    you unfreeze him?</p>

                <p> All right, all right, calm down. Listen to me, Morty. I know that new situations
                    can be intimidating. You're looking around, and it's all scary and different,
                    but, you know, m-meeting them head on, charging right into them like a bull
                    that's how we grow as people. I'm no stranger to scary situations. I deal with
                    them all the time. Now, if you just stick with me, Morty, we're gonna be—

                    I'm talking about, Morty. That's where my seeds are. If we would have done what
                    you wanted, I would have never have found them, because you're so in love with

                <p> You ask a lot of questions, Morty. Not very charismatic. It makes you kind of an

                <p> Just take these shoes, Morty. They're <stage>burps.</stage> special grappling
                    shoes. When you're wearing these things, these babies, you can basically just

                <p>The fact is, your son, Morty, has attended this school for a total of seven hours
                    over the last two months.</p>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Principal Vagina</speaker>
                <p>I done been notifying you. Have you not been getting the messages I've been
                    leaving with Morty's grandfather?</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>

                <p> Boom! Told you! In your face! He is ruining our child! Wait, what am I
                    celebrating?</p>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Principal Vagina</speaker>
                <p>Yeah, see, I thought something was fishy there, because it's usually Morty's
                    grandpa that's taking him out of school. <stage>they stop to see Summer and some
                        other students, crying at an obituary for Frank.</stage></p>

                <p>We had a little incident. A student was frozen to death. <stage>chuckles.</stage>
                    And there's no evidence that a Latino student did it! Everyone wants to take
                    this to a racial place. I won't let them.</p>

                    don't like being told where to go and what to do. I consider it a violation. Did

                <p> Yeah, Rick. Let's just get this over with, okay? I mean, these things are

                <p> That means they're good ones. You're a good kid, Morty. Those mega seeds are
                    super valuable to my work. You've been a huge help to me. I'm gonna be able to

                        and slaps the alien in the face, causing the alien to cry; he then coughs up
                        a life form from the smoke and the lifeform starts running through the glarp
                        zone and goes through the entire aging process from developing fetus to
                        decomposing corpse, over the course of three seconds.</stage></p>

                        crash to the ground and he dies; they then run to the portal

                <p> It's a figure of speech, Morty. They're bureaucrats. I don't respect them. Just

                        continues shooting the Gromflomites and even kills some innocent bystanders

                        in the lunchroom at school and Rick and Morty land on the table where

                <p> You can get his number later. Come on, Morty. We got to get out of here. You got
                    to get those seeds out of your ass. <stage>Rick and Morty are stopped by Jerry,
                        Beth, and Principal Vagina.</stage></p>

                <p> I'm an angry father, not an improviser.</p>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Rick</speaker>
                <p> Oh, hi, Jerry. Oh, my goodness, Morty! What are you doing out of class? We
                    talked about this. Your-your parents and I are very disappointed in-in this
                    behavior... No? No takers? <stage>Rick and Morty are back at home in the garage
                        while Jerry and Beth start taking all his things and packing them up so he
                        can move to the nursing home.</stage></p>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Rick</speaker>
                <p> You guys should really not be touching that stuff. It's beyond your

            <sp>
                <speaker>Jerry</speaker>
                <p> You're beyond our reasoning!</p>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Beth</speaker>
                <p> Dad, how could you make my son miss an entire semester of school? I mean, it's
                    not like he's a hot girl. He can't just bail on his life and set up shop in
                    someone else's.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Rick</speaker>
                <p> What what are you guys doing with my stuff?</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Beth</speaker>
                <p> We're moving you to a nursing home.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Rick</speaker>
                <p> A nursing home? What are what are you, nuts? I'm a genius. I build robots for
                    fun.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Jerry</speaker>
                <p> Well, now you can build baskets and watch Paul Newman movies on VHS and mentally
                    scar the Boy Scouts every Christmas.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Beth</speaker>
                <p> What does that mean?</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Jerry</speaker>
                <p> It's personal.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Morty</speaker>
                <p> Dad, mom, come on. Rick just needed my help is all.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Jerry</speaker>
                <p> Morty, stay out of this. You are obviously not capable of judging these
                    situations on your own.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Rick</speaker>
                <p> What are you trying to say about Morty? That he's stupid or something?</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Beth</speaker>
                <p> Oh, don't high-road us, dad. You know fully well that Morty is the last child
                    that needs to be missing classes.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Rick</speaker>
                <p> I-I-I don't know what you mean by that. Can can can you be a little bit more
                    specific?</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Jerry</speaker>
                <p> Oh, for crying out—he's got some kind of disability or something. Is that what
                    you want us to say?</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Morty</speaker>
                <p> I do?</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Jerry</speaker>
                <p> Well, duh doy, son. Look, I love you, Morty, but we both know you're not as fast
                    as the other kids, and if you want to compete in this world, you got to work
                    twice as hard.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Morty</speaker>
                <p> Aw, geez, dad. Y-you know, that's a lot to drop on a kid all at once.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Rick</speaker>
                <p> Morty, t-tell your parents the square root of pi.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Morty</speaker>
                <p> Oh, come on, Rick. You know I can't.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Rick</speaker>
                <p> The square root of Pi, Morty. Go!</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Morty</speaker>
                <p> 1.77245385... Whoa!</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Beth</speaker>
                <p> What the hell?</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Jerry</speaker>
                <p>
                    <stage>checks Morty's answer with calculator.</stage> Holy crap. He's right.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Rick</speaker>
                <p> Morty, tell your parents the first law of Thermodynamics.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Morty</speaker>
                <p> "The increment in the internal energy of a system is equal to the increment of
                    heat supplied to the system." Wow! I'm so smart!</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Jerry</speaker>
                <p> But—</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Rick</speaker>
                <p> I told the both of you school is stupid. It's not how you learn things. Morty's
                    a gifted child. He has a special mind. That's why he's my little helper. He's
                    like me. He's gonna be doing great science stuff later in his life. He's too
                    smart for school. He needs to keep hanging out and helping me.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Beth</speaker>
                <p> Jerry, I don't want whatever's happening here to stop.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Jerry</speaker>
                <p> No, I-I understand. Uh, maybe we overreacted. But he has to keep going to
                    school.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Rick</speaker>
                <p> Okay, Jerry. You drive a hard bargain, but what am I supposed to do? Say no?
                    You-you really wear the pants around here. I just want you to know, between us,
                    from now on, it's gonna be clear communication. <stage>Summer butts in, crying
                        over the death of Frank.</stage></p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Summer</speaker>
                <p>
                    <stage>crying.</stage> Frank Palicky was frozen to death today!</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Rick</speaker>
                <p> No idea what you're talking about. <stage>Summer leaves, crying.</stage></p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Jerry</speaker>
                <p> Okay. Well, uh, Morty, it's your bedtime in an hour. Don't stay up all night
                    again. This is good, though. This can work. I think we can be a family and now,
                    Beth, if you'll have me, I would love to have you.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Beth</speaker>
                <p> You know what? Okay. <stage>she and Jerry leave.</stage></p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Morty</speaker>
                <p> Holy cow, Rick. I didn't know hanging out with you was making me smarter.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Rick</speaker>
                <p> Full disclosure, Morty it's not. Temporary superintelligence is just a side
                    effect of the mega seeds dissolving in your rectal cavity.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Morty</speaker>
                <p> Aw, man.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Rick</speaker>
                <p> Yeah, and once those seeds wear off, you're gonna lose most of your motor
                    skills, and you're also gonna lose a significant amount of brain functionality
                    for 72 hours, Morty. Starting right about now.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Morty</speaker>
                <p> Ohh, man. <stage>losing consciousness) Oh, geez! Ohh. (drops to the ground and
                        starts moaning as he has a seizure.</stage></p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
                <speaker>Rick</speaker>
                <p> I'm sorry, Morty. It's a bummer. In reality, you're as dumb as they come and I
                    needed those seeds real bad, and I had to give them up just to get your parents
                    off my back, so now we're gonna have to go get more adventures. <stage>excitedly
                        looks down upon him, telling him about their future adventures.</stage> And
                    then we're gonna go on even more adventures after that, Morty and you're gonna
                    keep your mouth shut about it, Morty, because the world is full of idiots that
                    don't understand what's important, and they'll tear us apart, Morty but if you
                    stick with me, I'm gonna accomplish great things, Morty, and you're gonna be
                    part of them, and together, we're gonna run around, Morty. We're gonna do all
                    kinds of wonderful things, Morty. Just you and me, Morty. The outside world is
                    our enemy, Morty. We're the only friends we've got, Morty. It's just Rick and
                    Morty. Rick and Morty and their adventures, Morty. Rick and Morty forever and
                    forever. Morty's things. Me and Rick and Morty running around, and Rick and
                    Morty time. All day long, forever. All a hundred days. Rick and Morty forever
                    100 times. Over and over, rickandmortyadventures.com. All 100 years. Every
