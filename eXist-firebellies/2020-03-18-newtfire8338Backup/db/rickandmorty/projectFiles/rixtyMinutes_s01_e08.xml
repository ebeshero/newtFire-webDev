<sp><speaker>Beth</speaker><p> Hold on.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Bachelor (on TV)</speaker><p> Will you please... NOT marry me-- I choose Veronica.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Summer</speaker><p> What?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jerry</speaker><p> Yes!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Beth</speaker><p> Called it.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Summer</speaker><p> Why would he choose Veronica?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jerry</speaker><p> Because he loves her?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p> Well if it's any consolation, Summer, none of it mattered, and the entire show is stupid.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jerry</speaker><p> Okay, I've got an idea, Rick. You show us your concept of "good TV", and we'll crap all over that.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick </speaker><p> <stage>stands, walking to the TV</stage> I thought you'd never ask.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jerry</speaker><p> Wait, does that mean we get Showtime Extreme?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p> How about Showtime Extreme in a world where man evolved from corn? <stage>turns on TV</stage></p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Corn Man 1 (on TV)</speaker><p> We're not so different. We're both corn of action.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Corn Man 2 (on TV)</speaker><p> Yeah... But one of us is dead corn! <stage>shoots Corn Man 1</stage></p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Summer</speaker><p> Boring.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p> Summer, <stage>belch] you just spent [belch</stage> three months watching a man choose a fake wife.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jerry</speaker><p> So, what, It'd be better if the people were corn?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p> Really? All right, fine.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Woman (on TV)</speaker><p> Glenn, this is a court order. It says you can't eat shit anymore.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p> All right, Jerry, when you're right, you're right. Now I'm hooked.</p></sp>

Int. Smith Residence. The Smith Family and Rick are sitting in the living room watching TV.

<sp><speaker>Beth</speaker><p> How is this possible?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p> Infinite time lines, infinite possibilities. Including a time line where Jerry's a movie star. Look, you guys are getting excited about the wrong aspect of this device. Ju-- Wa-- Look at this. <stage>changes channel</stage></p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Host in Trenchcoat (on TV)</speaker><p> Wow, that one was really quick, wasn't it?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p> Now who wants to watch random, crazy TV shows from different dimensions a-a-and then who wants to narcissistically obsess about their alternate self?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Beth, Summer, and Jerry <stage>all at once</stage></speaker><p> Narcissism. The narcisstic stuff. I want to obsess about myself.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p> <stage>sighs] Here. [stands, pulling an ocular device from his coat] These scan your retinas, and let you view parallel time lines through genetically matching versions of your eyes. [throws the device into the kitchen</stage> Go fetch!</p></sp>

<stage>Jerry, Summer, and Beth run to the kitchen] Beth and Summer [at the same time</stage>Yes! This is so cool! Ladies First!

<sp><speaker>Rick</speaker><p> I'm proud of you, Morty.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Morty</speaker><p> Hey man, I don't give a crap about myself, Rick. Let's watch some crazy stuff, yo!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Ants-In-My-Eyes Johnson (on TV)</speaker><p> I'm Ants-In-My-Eyes Johnson, Here at Ants-in-My-Eyes Johnson's Electronics. I mean, there's so many ants in my eyes! And there's so many TVs, microwaves, radios I think, I can't-- I'm not 100% sure what we have here in stock, because I can't see anything. Our prices, I hope, aren't too low! Check out this refrigerator! Only $200! What about this microwave? Only $100! That's fair! I'm Ants-in-My-Eyes Johnson! Everything's black, I can't see a thing! <stage>set on fire</stage> And also I can't feel anything either-- did I mention that? But that's not as catchy as having ants in your eyes. So that always goes, you know, off by the wayside. I can't feel. It's a very rare disease. All my-- All my nerves, they don't allow for the sensation of touch. So I never know what's going on. Am I standing? Sitting? I don't know.</p></sp>

Int. Smith Residence. Jerry, Beth, and Summer are in the kitchen with the Ocular Device.

<sp><speaker>Beth</speaker><p> Are we sure we want to do this? Look at our own alternate lives?</p></sp>

Jerry

 You're right. Maybe we should just play Yahtzee--
<stage>grabs the device] Give me those! [turns switch</stage>

Beth

 What do you see?
Jerry

 Whiteness... Pure whiteness.
Johnny Depp (on Device)

 You're my best friend, Jerry Smith. I love doing cocaine with you.
Jerry

 Whoa! I love doing cocaine with you too, Johnny Depp!
Beth

 <stage>sighs, taking the device</stage> Haven't we spent enough time on you?
<stage>turns switch</stage> I'm performing surgery... but not on a horse, on a human!

Jerry

 That's great, Beth! You always wanted to be a real surgeon.
Beth <stage>taking off device</stage>

 I am a real surgeon.
Jerry

 Ahh, uh-- Summer's turn! <stage>giving Summer the device</stage>
Summer

 Finally! I don't see anything.
Beth

 Well, you should select a different timeline, I mean, if your father and I achieved our dreams, there's a chance you weren't even born-- That came out wrong, that came out very wrong.
Summer

 Fine, I'll find a world where you bothered to have me. <stage>turns switch a few times</stage> We're playing Yahtzee.
Beth

 Yahtzee's fun. We love Yahtzee.

 It's a fun game for fun families! Hey, could I get those goggles back for a second?

Mr. Sneezy 3D (on TV)

 Oh, I'm Mr. Sneezy! Achoo!

 Huh, seems like TV from other dimensions has a somewhat looser feel to it.
Rick

 Yeah, it's got an almost improvisational tone. <stage>changes channel</stage>
Announcer (on TV)

<sp><speaker> It's in theaters now! Coming this summer</speaker><p> Two brothers. In a van. And then a meteor hit. And they ran as fast as they could, from giant cat monsters. And then a giant tornado came and that's when things got knocked into 12th gear.</p></sp>

Old women are coming, and they're also in the movie, and they're gonna come, and cross attack these two brothers. But let's get back to the brothers, because they're-- they have a strong bond.

Summer <stage>turning switch</stage>

 <stage>dryly] Ooh, we're not playing Yahtzee, [shoves device into Jerry's hands</stage> we're playing Chutes and Ladders. It seems like when I exist, life gets a little more, I don't know, predictable?
Beth

 When two people create a life together, they set aside their previous lives as individuals.
Jerry

 Gimme a break! We're not heroes for having unprotected sex on prom night.
Beth

 Oh, I get it. Now that you know you could have had it better, you resent me for holding you back.
Jerry

 Well now that we know you think the tables are turning, we know you thought there were unturned tables!
Beth

 <stage>scoffs</stage> What are you talking about?
Jerry

 All this time, you've been thinking, "What if that loser Jerry hadn't talked me out of the abortion?"
Summer

 Um--
Jerry

<sp><speaker> Well now you know</speaker><p> you'd be a doctor. <stage>circles finger] Whoop-dee-doo. You'd also be drinking wine, alone in a house full of exotic birds. And I'd be on DiCaprio's yacht-- [holds up device</stage> banging Kristen Stewart!</p></sp>
Summer

 You thought about getting an abortion?
Beth

 Everyone thinks about it. Obviously, I'm the version of me that didn't do it. So you're welcome.
Jerry

 Yeah, you're welcome.
Summer

 Yeah, thank you guys so much. It's a real treat to be raised by parents that force themselves to be together instead of being happy.
Rick <stage>walking to the cupboard</stage>

 Hey, do we have any wafer cookies? <stage>grabs cookie box. eats cooke and starts walking away] Mm! [stops and looks back at Jerry, Summer and Beth] Oh, boy. Looks like you guys have been checking out alternate lives and realizing you don't have it as good, huh? That's too bad. You know, me and Morty are having a blast, We just discovered a show called "Ball Fondlers". I mean, I don't want to rub it in or anything, but you guys clearly backed the wrong conceptual horse.

Beth

 So now what do we do?
Jerry

 That show "Ball Fondlers" sounded kind of interesting.
Summer

 Dad!
Jerry

 What? They're having fun in there! What do you guys want from me? Every family on this block has to wonder if they're together by choice. Our family just has inter-dimensional goggles to show us for a fact that we're not.
Summer

 We'll I'm leaving!
Beth

 You can't leave, you're 17!
Summer

 Yeah, and I'm not pregnant. I'm gonna have better judgment than you guys had at my age.

 Hey, Rick, you know, di-did they use Bill Murray for this? Sounds a lot like Bill Murray.
Rick

 No, Morty, it's Lorenzo Music. In this reality, he's still alive.
Morty

 Oh, okay, was his name Lorenzo Music?
Rick

 Yeah, I'm pretty sure. He also did that voice of that one guy from Ghostbusters, which is really strange, because it's the same character Bill Murray played in the movie. But then, when they made the movie Bill Murray did the voice of Gazorpazorp-- or Garfield, I mean.
Morty

 Yeah, that's pretty cool, Rick. So all that happened in this reality too?
Rick

 I don't know. Just making conversation with you, Morty. What do you think? I-I-I-I know everything about everything?

 Did you really talk me out of the abortion? <stage>drinking from a now empty winebox</stage>

 Well, we... we blew a tire on the way to the clinic.
Beth

 I think, in my head, I was doing it all for the kids. And now the first kid is going to... do something with turquoise.
Jerry

 Which is either code for crystal meth, or a gateway to it.
Beth

 So, we didn't do the kids any favors. So, we should stay together for each other and ourselves... or...
